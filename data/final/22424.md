The Sustainable Building Tax Credit (SBTC) reflects the state's intention to incentivize cuttingedge sustainable building practices, as well as the use of energy-efficient products. There are two types of tax credits available under the programâ€”-one for installation of certain energy-efficient products in existing residences and another for commercial renovation and new construction projects.

Before accessing the online application for energy-conserving products, please read the application instructions and checklist to verify you have all of the required documentation ready for upload with your application. Energy-Conserving Products include certain air source and ground source heat-pumps, heat pump water heaters, windows, doors, insulation upgrades, and electric vehicle charging equipment.  

The credits for new construction or large commercial renovations went into effect on January 1, 2022, and applications for those credits can be submitted now via this online portal for new construction or commercial renovation.  

Please note that the Legislature placed annual program caps on the total amount of tax credits that ECMD can approve under this program. So, it is important to submit your application as soon as possible. There also are caps on the amount of tax credit that can be awarded for each energyconserving product installed. The caps are higher for products installed in affordable housing units or dwelling occupied by low-income residents. See details on those caps here.  

However, there are no caps on credits individual taxpayers can claim for their construction projects.  

The table below outlines the annual fund caps for the program.
