enacted in 2022, added a new provision to the Connecticut statutes governing
the rules of homeowners associations. The law establishes that associations
"may not adopt or enforce any rules that would have the effect of prohibiting
any unit owner from installing a solar power generating system on the roof of
such owner's unit, provided such roof is not shared with any other unit
owner." However, associations may adopt rules governing the size and manner of
affixing, installing or removing a solar power generating system; the unit
owner's responsibilities for periodic upkeep and maintenance of such solar
power generating system; and a prohibition on any unit owner installing a
solar power generating system upon any common elements of the association.
These rules do not apply to a common interest community that is a condominium
or a cooperative.
