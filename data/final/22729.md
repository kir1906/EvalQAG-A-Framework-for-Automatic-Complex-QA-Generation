# Complete Income Qualification  

All participating households must verify their total household annual income is less than $150\%$ of the Area Median Income (AMI). A household includes all individuals living in the home, regardless of relation. You may be asked to provide documentation income.  

By reviewing the IRA Income Qualification Checklist, you can have your documents ready when applying. We encourage online applications for quicker processing and results but have a print-ready option too.  

This short video, IRA Home Energy Rebates Income Qualification Process, explains income qualification step-by-step.
