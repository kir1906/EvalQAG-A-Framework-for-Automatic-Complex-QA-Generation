 ## Summary : 
 In May 2013, Minnesota enacted [HF
729](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=HF0729&session=ls88&session_year=2014&session_number=0&version=latest),
which created the framework for Community Solar Gardens. The law set no
cumulative capacity limits, but each Community Solar facility would be limited
to 1 MW capacity.  

Customers of Xcel Energy subscribe to community solar garden projects offered
by private developers. Customers of other utilities may subscribe to community
solar gardens that are offered by their utility.
