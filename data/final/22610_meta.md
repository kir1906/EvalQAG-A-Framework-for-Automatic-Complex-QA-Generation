 ## Summary : 
 Maine has a goal of developing 3,000 megawatts (MW) of wind energy in
proximate federal waters by December 31, 2040. Beginning January 1, 2025 and
every two years thereafter the Governor's Energy Office may reevaluate and
increase the goal. Maine law ([35-A MRSA
ยง3408](https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/35-A/title35-Asec3408.html),
enacted in 2023) also requires the Governor's Energy Office to establish a
schedule for competitive solicitations for the development of offshore wind.

  

History:

Maine previously had a goal of deploying at least 5,000 MW of offshore wind in
coastal waters by 2030, but this was amended by [L.D.
1895](https://legislature.maine.gov/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=SP0766&item=5&snum=131)
of 2023.
