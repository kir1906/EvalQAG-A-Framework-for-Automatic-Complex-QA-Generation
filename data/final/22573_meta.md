 ## Summary : 
 DC law prohibits homeowners association, condominium owners association, or
cooperative housing association from unreasonably prohibiting a member from
installing a solar system on their roof. They may, however, establish
reasonable guidelines, other than aesthetic guidelines, on the installation
and use of a solar energy collection device for the purposes of preventing
nuisance to other owners or members of the association.
