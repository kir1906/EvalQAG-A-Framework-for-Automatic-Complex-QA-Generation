7.75: Clean Energy Standard  

(1) Purpose, Authority and Scope. The purpose of 310 CMR 7.75, promulgated in conjunction with 310 CMR 7.74, is to assist the Commonwealth in achieving the greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals adopted pursuant to M.G.L. c. 21N, $\S3(\mathbf b)$ , by establishing a clean energy standard (CES) that will increase the level of clean electricity that is purchased from the regional electric grid for consumption in Massachusetts. To achieve those goals, the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) and the Department, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 21A, $\S\S\ S$ and 8 and M.G.L. c. 21N hereby jointly promulgate 310 CMR 7.75 following consultation with the Department of Energy Resources (DOER) and based on the considerations specified in M.G.L. c. 21N, $\S3(\mathsf{c})$ . In exercising their broad authority and discretion under M.G.L. c. 21N, $\S$ 3(c), EEA and the Department have determined that establishing the CES, along with the Commonwealth's other climate programs and policies, will ensure achievement of the greenhouse gas emissions limits as established under M.G.L. c. 21N, and that the 310 CMR 7.75 levels are consistent with, and take account of, regional programs such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). The Department is also consolidating in 310 CMR 7.75 a requirement previously codified at 310 CMR 7.71(9) for retail sellers of electricity to report statewide greenhouse gas emissions and to monitor and ensure compliance with the reporting provisions of M.G.L. c. 21N, $\S2$ (a)(5). 310 CMR 7.75 is also promulgated pursuant to M.G.L. c. 21A, $\S16$ and M.G.L. c. 111, $\S\S\-2C$ and 142A through 142E.
