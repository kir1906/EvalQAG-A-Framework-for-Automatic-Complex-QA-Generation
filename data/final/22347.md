VEC o!ers Level II EV chargers to members at no charge.  

To take advantage of this o!er members must:  

Enroll their charger in a communications platform so that VEC can request that the charger not operate during peak events (five to six times per month for three to four hours each). You can opt out of individual events if needed. You will receive an $\$8$ /month incentive if you do not opt out of events.   
Enroll in VEC’s Beat the Peak Program to receive alerts during the summer (approximately three to four events) when VEC expects high demand for electricity. During these events, VEC requests that members voluntarily take steps to decrease their electric use, such as shutting lights o!, turning up the thermostat, and delaying use of major appliances.  

To request a charger, please fill out this form. To read the Member Participation Agreement, click here.  

If you purchase your own Level II charger, you can receive a $\$250$ incentive if you either 1) set a schedule to not charger from 5-9pm Monday through Friday, or 2) if it is a Flo or ChargePoint, enroll it in VEC's communications platform to receive another $\$50$ upfront incentive and $\$8$ /month as long as you do not opt out of events.
