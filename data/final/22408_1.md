# VW Settlement Background  

# Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection  

# Timeline  

2009 VW Begins Installing Defeat Devices on Diesel Vehicles Recognizes federal and California test procedures and alters performance to meet standards  

2014 Independent Researchers Publish Results  

“significantly higher in-use emissions” than certified levels for 2012 Jetta TDI  

2015 VW Publicly Admits to Altering Vehicles to Meet Federal and California Standards 11 Million vehicles globally, 590k in US, over 12k in CT  

# Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection  

# Volkswagen Settlement  

Multiple consent decrees issued to address VW’s illega use of emission control “defeat devices” on nearly 590,000 VW, Audi, and Porsche 2.0L and 3.0L diesel vehicles for model years 2009-2016  

Intent of settlement funds is to achieve NOx reductions to offset the excess NOx created by the subject VW vehicles  

![](images/bf92cc8115c4144e9ca332b1113da9814a3045c5191b278ce3d1ffc0efafcc60.jpg)  

# Environmental Mitigation Trust – Appendix D  

Settlement put \$2.925 billion into environmental mitigation trust  

Support environmental programs over 10 years to offset excess NOx emitted by VWs cars  

Allocation for CT is about \$55.7 Million   
– This allocation could increase if beneficiaries do not spend the money in time specified  

Disbursement over 10 year schedule  

Trust account is administered by Wilmington Trust (“the Trustee”)  

Trustee will approve project funding based on applications for eligible projects meeting specific criteria  

To access funds, CT had to become a “trust beneficiary”  

# Connecticut’s Path to Funding  

October 2, 2017 – Trust Effective Date  

October 3, 2017 – Connecticut submits its beneficiary form to Trustee naming DEEP as lead agency for CT’s settlement funds  

January 29, 2018 – Trustee officially certifies CT as a Designated Beneficiary under the VW trust.  

April 26, 2018 – CT submits its final mitigation plan to the Trustee  

May 30, 2018 – CT launches its first round of funding under the VW settlement August 1, 2019 – CT launches second round of VW funding August 20, 2021 – CT launches VW third round of funding  

Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection  

# CT Mitigation Plan  

CT was required to prepare Mitigation Plan which provided the public with a high level vision on how CT will use its funds  

Initial draft released in Feb 2017  

Held informal public comment period and also held public informational session  

Proposed Final draft released in Feb 2018 Held formal comment period  

Submitted Final Mitigation Plan to Trustee on April 26, 2018

# Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection  

# VW EVSE Allocation  

VW Settlement allows for 15% of the total Trust to be allocated towards light duty electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE).  

DEEP has committed the maximum amount, \$8.4 million, to fund EVSE projects.  NOTE: The \$8.4 million committed for the EVSE Program is separate and apart from funds available for EVSE included with an electric replacement or repower project under the Vehicle Program.  

DEEP is proposing to offer multiple rounds of EVSE funding over time to allow for the integration of lessons learned in subsequent rounds and adjustment to improvements in technology.  

CT initial round of funding under the EVSE Program is designated for   
government and non-government entities   
Initial round will be EVSE only, no H2 funding

# Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection  

# Eligible EVSE Expenses  

DEEP is limited by the VW Consent Decree, Appendix D-2 (page 8), as to the extent of funding under the mitigation grants.  The Consent Decree requires each participating state to adopt a State Mitigation Plan which lays out the scope of projects that can be funded.  

DEEP adopted the State Mitigation Plan, including requirements for EVSE installation (Page 17), in 2018.  This language states (and substantially mirrors  the Consent Decree):  

Eligible Project Types: Eligible light duty ZEV supply equipment includes:  

Light duty electric vehicle supply equipment: evel 1, Level 2 or fast charging equipment (or analogous successor technologies) that is located in a public place, workplace, or multiunit dwelling and is not consumer light duty electric vehicle supply equipment (i.e., not located at a private residential dwelling that is not a multi-unit dwelling); and  

In summary, the VW Mitigation Trust grants can cover the cost of the EVSE, installation (e.g.   
electrical to the meter, trenching, pad construction) and labor associated with those tasks.  

Note:  Level 1 and H2 fueling will not be eligible during this funding round  

# Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection  

# Non-Eligible Expenses  

Items that are not covered under the grant include:  

Labor costs not associated with installation of the EVSE.   
“To the Meter” or “make ready” costs (service upgrades, new panels, etc.) “Make Ready” costs in Connecticut are funded through the Electric Utilities “make ready” programs.

– \$1 million non-government (open to the public) EVSE Proposal Deadline: September 30, 2022 @ 5:00 PM EST Anticipated Awards:  December 15, 2022   
Funds for EVSE at multi-unit dwellings and workplace charging will be released at a later date.   
This is a reimbursement program  

# VW EVSE Round 1 Overview – Cont.  

Funding will be awarded through an open competitive and transparent process  

Matching funds required for all projects  

For this funding round, all chargers must be publicly accessible including chargers proposed to be installed at workplace and MUDs  

Projects and final paperwork must be completed 18 months following award date; however, extensions will be allowed under certain circumstances (e.g., supply chain)  

# VW EVSE Round 1 Overview – Cont.  

# Project Initiation:  

Projects initiated prior to filing an application are not eligible for funding “initiated” means having signed a contract for procurement, initiation of procurement (e.g., purchase orders), or having started construction. “initiated” does not include:  

Site selection or evaluation.   
Applying for additional funding does not qualify as having initiated the project.  

# Matching Funds:  

DEEP encourages applicants to maximize all EVSE related funding for which they may be eligible from sources including, but not limited to, other state and federal agencies including PURA’s Connecticut EV Charging Program, federal EV infrastructure grants, and utility EV infrastructure grant programs.  

If a grantee receives additional funding subsequent to an award under this program, DEEP reserves the right to adjust the VW EVSE grant amount accordingly.  

# Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection  

# Funding Priorities for EVSE Round 1  

DEEP will select projects to be funded based on the funding priorities outlined in the State of Connecticut Mitigation Plan in addition to a set of preferential criteria outlined in the application form and instructions.  

Priority will be given to applications in underserved, environmental justice and overburdened communities.  

Build out the state’s Level 2 and DCFC network to support current and future EVSE demand to meet ZEV deployment commitment and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets.
