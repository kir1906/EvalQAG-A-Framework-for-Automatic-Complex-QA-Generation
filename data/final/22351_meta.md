 ## Summary : 
 **E-Bike and Retrofit Kit Rebate**

VPPSA member customers are eligible for a $100 rebate for an e-bike or
retrofit kit. To qualify, the e-bike or retrofit kit must be purchased at a
Vermont-based store.

E-bikes are bicycles with battery-powered motors that help assist with
pedaling. The motor helps to boost the bike uphill with less effort. A
retrofit kit can convert a regular bike to an e-bike by adding in the battery-
operated motor.

You'll need the following information for your application:

  * Proof of purchase
  * Photo of the model/serial number
  * Proof of residence if not the utility account holder
  * Completed W-9 form
