# Park & Plug  

Building the future of electric vehicles (EVs) in Florida.  

# EVs Everywhere  

We have been expanding clean energy and the future of electric vehicles (EVs) in Florida. Our EV network promotes cleaner energy and improves access to EV charging for everyone. Park & Plug chargers also collect data on EV charging behaviors and analyze the effects EVs have on the grid. This insight will help determine the best way to further expand EV charging.
