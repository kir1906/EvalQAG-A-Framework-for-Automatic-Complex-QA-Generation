# EARN \$500 CASH  

AP&T is pleased to continue the Electric Vehicle (EV) incentive program for its electrical service customers and employees!  

An AP&T electrical service customer (including employees) who purchases an EV for use in an AP&T service area will receive $\$500!$  

Be sure to also check out any federal tax credits that you may be eligible for!  

# A Boosted AMP-UP Program!  

AP&T has dropped the minimum battery size for its Amp-Up EV incentive program from 16 kWh to 14 kWh. As a result, various long-range electric motorcycles such as the Harley Davidson LiveWire, Zero SR, and Brutus V9 will qualify for a \$500 AP&T incentive. If you’re looking for an alternative approach to adventure that will help you power through the COVID-19 era, here’s a high horsepower opportunity!  

AP&T is expanding its commitment to clean transportation and economic development in rural Alaska by broadening its “AMP-UP” electric vehicle incentive program to include community charging stations!   
Local and tribal governments that install public charging stations for EVs are eligible to receive an incentive payment of up to \$1,000.

# A Meaningful Change.  

# AP&T – Committed to Serving Alaskan Communities  

This Electric Vehicle “EV” Incentive Program responds to consumer interest in EVs, and builds off of AP&T’s success field testing an EV in its Prince of Wales service area as a permanent fixture of its fleet.  

In AP&T’s southeast Alaska service areas – where 75% to 90% of energy is generated from renewable hydropower, utilization of electrical vehicles represents a meaningful way to significantly reduce fossil fuel costs and associated emissions and environment impacts, while hedging against the potential future fuel price increases.  

# A Meaningful Change.  

An AP&T electrical service customer who purchases an EV for use in an AP&T service area will receive a $\$500$ check from AP&T.

# Employee Incentives  

An AP&T employee who is also an AP&T electrical service customer who purchases an EV for use in an AP&T service area will receive a $\$500$ check from AP&T.  

To sign up for incentives, please contact your local Alaska Power & Telephone Service Center.  

Incentives will be paid on a first come, first served basis limited by AP&T’s internal budget. At the close of the program, AP&T will assess results and determine whether or not to extend additional incentives.
