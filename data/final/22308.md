# Buying an Electric Vehicle  

Consumers today can choose between hybrid vehicles, which do not plug in, and plug-in electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles. Buyers should evaluate their own driving needs to determine how the different EV technologies can work for them.  

# Technology & Adoption Trends  

Electric vehicle adoption rates have been soaring over the past few years as the battery technology allows longer distances to be traveled between charges. Auto manufacturers continue to announce new models, giving the consumer more choices than ever before.  

Adoption Rates in Georgia   
Currently Georgia has more than 40,000 registered EV drivers across the state, and Atlanta is the highest ranked city in the Eastern United States for the number of publicly available EV charging stations.

# Battery (BEV)  

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have no gasoline engine and run exclusively on the energy stored in on-board batteries.   
Examples include the Nissan LEAF, Chevrolet Bolt, Tesla Model 3, BMW i3, Mitsubishi Outlander and Chrysler Pacifica.

# Extended Range (EREV)  

Extended range electric vehicles (EREVs) can run on conventional or alternative fuel and an electric motor that uses energy stored in a battery. The battery is charged through regenerative braking and by the internal combustion engine and is not plugged in to charge.

# Plug-In Hybrid (PHEV)  

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are powered by an internal combustion engine that can run on conventional or alternative fuel and an electric motor that uses energy stored in a battery. The vehicle can be plugged in to an electric power source to charge the battery.
