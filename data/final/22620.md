# Credits for new clean vehicles purchased in 2023 or after  

If you place in service a new plug-in electric vehicle (EV) or fuel cell vehicle (FCV) in 2023 or after, you may qualify for a clean vehicle tax credit. For more information on how to qualify see Publication 5866, New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit Checklist PDF .  

At the time of sale, a seller must give you information about your vehicle's qualifications. Sellers must also register online and report the same information to the IRS. If they don't, your vehicle won't be eligible for the credit. For more information see Publication 5905, Information for Consumers Purchasing a New or Used Clean Vehicle PDF .  

Find information on credits for used clean vehicles, qualified commercial clean vehicles and new plug-in EVs purchased before 2023.  

# Who qualifies  

You may qualify for a credit up to $\$7,500$ under Internal Revenue Code Section 30D if you buy a new, qualified plug-in EV or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCV). The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 changed the rules for this credit for vehicles purchased from 2023 to 2032.  

The credit is available to individuals and their businesses.  

To qualify, you must:  

Buy it for your own use, not for resale Use it primarily in the U.S.  

In addition, your modified adjusted gross income (AGI) may not exceed:  

· $\$300,000$ for married couples filing jointly or a surviving spouse   
· $\$225,000$ for heads of households   
. $\$150,000$ for all other filers You can use your modified AGI from the year you take delivery of the vehicle or the year before, whichever is less.   
If your modified AGI is below the threshold in 1 of the 2 years, you can claim the credit.  

If you do not transfer the credit, it is nonrefundable when you file your taxes, so you can't get back more on the credit than you owe in taxes. You can't apply any excess credit to future tax years.  

# Credit amount  

The amount of the credit depends on when you placed the vehicle in-service (took delivery), regardless of purchase date.

In general, the minimum credit will be $\$3,751$ $\$2,500$ times $\$417$ ), the credit amount for a vehicle with the minimum 7 kilowatt hours of battery capacity.  

# For vehicles placed in-service April 18, 2023 and after:

· $\$3,750$ if the vehicle meets the critical minerals requirement only $\$3,750$ if the vehicle meets the battery components requirement only $\$7,500$ if the vehicle meets both
