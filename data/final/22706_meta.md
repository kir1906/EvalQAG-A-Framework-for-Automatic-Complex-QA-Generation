 ## Summary : 
 **_Note: Applications are due November 26, 2024. The Environmental Finance
Authority anticipates opening another round of funding in 2026 for about
$15.48 million._**

The Georgia Environmental Finance Authority released an RFP for grid
operators, storage operators, distribution providers, among other entities, to
enhance the resiliency of the electric grid. Eligible projects include the use
or construction of DERs for enhancing resiliency during disruptive grid
events, including microgrids and battery storage subcomponents.

Energy storage systems, including batteries, are allowed if the system is used
to improve grid resilience during disruptive events. Co-located storage
systems may be allowed, and any equipment integrated a battery into a solar
system is likely an allowable expense.

The awards vary, and cost matching is required.
