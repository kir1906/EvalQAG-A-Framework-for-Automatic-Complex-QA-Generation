 ## Summary : 
 **_Note: The Federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) created the Home
Electrification and Appliance Rebate (HEAR) Program. The IRA established the
main parameters for this program, but allowed the states to customize the
program to meet their state-specific needs. The program is designed to award
rebates for purchase of qualifying home electrification equipment and
appliances. Residents earning less than 80% of the Area Median Income
([AMI](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html)) can receive the full
rebate amount, and residents earning between 80% and 150% AMI can receive a
partial rebate. See summary below and program website for complete details.

In May 2024, New York became the[first
state](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-
first-state-nation-launch-historic-home-energy) in the nation to launch their
Home Energy Rebate program, created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The
first phase of the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) program
is available for income-eligible New Yorkers and will be run through the
stateâ€™s existing
[EmPower+](https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/2324/empower-
new-york) program. Additional IRA rebates, includes offers for multifamily
buildings and certain high-efficiency appliances, will become available later
in 2024.
