 ## Summary : 
 **_Note: The[ Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf#page=993)
created the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/) with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

Iowa conducted its award process for NEVI funding during Winter and Spring
2024; the application deadline has passed but awardees have not yet been
announced. Details on Iowa's NEVI process can be found in the [IA EV
Infrastructure Deployment
Plan](https://iowadot.gov/iowaevplan/docs/IowaNEVDI_Final.pdf).
