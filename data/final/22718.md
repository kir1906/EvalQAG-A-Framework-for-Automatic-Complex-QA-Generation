# Federal Tax Credits & Incentives for Homes and Residential Buildings Residents, businesses, community organizations, and governments can save money by reducing energy use and emissions.  

Funding opportunities are available to eligible residents, families, businesses, community organizations, and government partners for appliance and building system upgrades that reduce emissions. These upgrades help save on energy costs once installed.

# Inflation Reduction Act Home Energy Rebates: Rebates from the Inflation Reduction Act are not yet widely available.  

The Colorado Energy Office (CEO) received $\$140$ million in federal funding for two programs that will provide rebates to Colorado homeowners and renters for home energy efficiency improvements and electrification upgrades. CEO is finalizing development of both Home Energy Rebate programs.  

The Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate program (HEAR) provides financial incentives to income-qualified homes and multifamily buildings for electrification upgrades. HEAR rebates will be available for technologies such as heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, and electric load service centers and wiring.   
The Home Energy Efficiency Rebate program (HOMES) will provide whole home energy efficiency upgrades for mobile/manufactured homes and large multifamily buildings. Rebates will target measures that maximize energy and cost savings. Rebate amounts will vary based on household income and energy savings.

# Program Updates as of January 2025  

CEO launched a first phase of the HEAR program through the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) Fall 2024. The state dedicated $\$7.6$ million for this initial phase.  

The full HEAR and HOMES programs, including direct-to-consumer rebates, are expected to launch later this year. CEO is currently finalizing the rebate program details and developing an outreach and engagement strategy.  

To receive rebates, home and building owners will need to work with registered contractors from the CEO Home Energy Rebate Program contractor network for electrification and energy efficiency upgrades. More information about contractor requirements and how to register will be available soon.

Residents can also receive the Colorado Heat Pump Tax Credit (https://energyoffice.colorado.gov/hptc) as an upfront discount on the installatio cost of qualified heat pump technology through a registered contractor.  

Additionally, the Colorado Energy Officeâ€™s Weatherization Assistance Program provides no-cost home energy improvements to help incomequalified Coloradans save money, reduce emissions, and increase home comfort and safety. The Weatherization Assistance Program is not a rebate program.
