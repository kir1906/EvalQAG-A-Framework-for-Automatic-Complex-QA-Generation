# Program History  

In 2021, Governor Greg Gianforte signed into law the Commercial Property-Assessed Capital Enhancements Act of Montana (PACE Act), which codified in MCA 90-4-13 authorized the creation of a Commercial Property-Assessed Capital Enhancements (C-PACE) program to be administered by the Montana Facility Finance Authority. This C-PACE program, now known as the Last Best PACE Program, went into effect January 1, 2022.  

# About the Authority  

The 2021 legislative session authorized the Montana Facility Finance Authority (“MFFA” or the “Authority”) to become the state-wide administrator of the Commercial Property-Assessed Capital Enhancements or “C-PACE” program. The C-PACE program qualifies projects eligible for private sector financing through low-cost, long-term loans to pay for water conservation, energyefficiency improvements, and renewable energy retrofits for private sector owners of commercial, industrial, non-profit, agricultural, and multi-family properties with four or more dwelling units.  

Under the PACE Act, the Authority is tasked as the program administrator in charge of establishment and operation of a statewide program to enable the creation of C-PACE Districts and support property owners, lenders, and local governments as they use C-PACE financing. The Authority’s work on the Last Best PACE Program will be funded by transaction fees paid by the parties or other sources of revenue. The Authority will not receive compensation or reimbursement from local governments.  

The Authority’s primary role is to provide not-for-profit health care providers with access to lowcost capital. The Authority provides tax-exempt bond financing, low-interest loans and limited planning grants for non-for-profit healthcare organizations and small value-added manufacturers with projects of less than $\$10$ million. The Authority is an enterprise fund administratively connected to the Montana Department of Commerce.  

# Mission  

Enhance Montana healthcare and community capabilities through access to cost-effective capita financing and development services.  

# Values  

The Authority holds the following values as important to the achievement of its mission.  These values guide our internal conduct and relationships with our partners:  

Accessibility Accountability Community   
• Effectiveness   
• Relationships Self-sustaining Nimble  

\*The Authority would like to thank all working group members who provided insight and expertise to help mold the Last Best PACE Program guidelines. Special thanks go out to Northern Plains Resource Council, PACENation, and the C-PACE Alliance for being guiding forces through this process.

# Program Overview  

Note: Defined terms are Capitalized and can be found in Appendix A: Definitions.  

Last Best PACE is an innovative program that qualifies projects eligible for private sector financing through low-cost, long-term loans to pay for water conservation, energy-efficiency improvements, and renewable energy retrofits.  C-PACE loans provide up to $100\%$ financing of all eligible project costs, with little or no up-front out-of-pocket cost to the private sector owners of commercial, industrial, non-profit, agricultural, and multi-family properties with four or more dwelling units.  

C-PACE loans made under the Last Best PACE Program are secured by a tax assessment on the property that is voluntarily imposed by the Record Owner and may be amortized over the projected life of the energy improvements.  As a result, these improvements can generate neutral, or even positive cash flow upon installation.  

C-PACE assessments are tied to the property and follow title from one Record Owner to the next. Each Record Owner is responsible only for payment of the assessments accruing during its period of ownership. When the property is sold, the payment obligation for the remaining balance of the assessment is transferred to the next Record Owner. As a result, the program helps Record Owners overcome market barriers which often discourage investment in energy efficiency and water conservation improvements.  

The State of Montana, via the Montana Facility Finance Authority as Program Administrator, established the Last Best PACE Program to encourage private sector investment in energy efficiency and water conservation. The Last Best PACE program is offered to Record Owners on a strictly voluntary basis and loans are privately financed.  

# Eligible Property Requirements  

All private sector owners of commercial, industrial, non-profit, agricultural, and multi-family properties with four or more dwelling units may voluntarily participate in the Last Best PACE Program.  

Properties must be located in a Montana city, county, town, or a consolidated city-county that has established or will establish, a C-PACE District. The property must be on the property tax rolls (or eligible to be placed on the property tax rolls) and have a property tax identification number within the C-PACE District.  

The properties must:  

Be current on all taxes   
Be current on mortgage payments   
Have no “mechanics” or similar liens against the property   
Not be involved in any bankruptcy proceedings  

Properties with multiple Parcel IDs require additional documentation and underwriting and Energy Assessments for these projects must include:  

• Description of the method of spreading the annual installment between the parcels; • List of lots, blocks, tracts, and parcels of land in the C-PACE Project; and • Amount assessed on each parcel  

The Last Best PACE Program reserves the right to deny properties with multiple Parcel IDs if any one of the Parcel IDs cannot support a prorate portion of a C-PACE Project  

Ineligible Property types are as follows:  

Residential single family (1–3 units) • Residential condominiums Property owned by a local, state, or federal government Property owned by a homeowner’s or condominium association  

# Eligible C-PACE Project Types  

# 1. Existing-Building Retrofit Improvements  

The existing conditions of a building shall be used to establish the baseline level of energy and water usage against which the performance of the Energy Conservation Project (ECP) will be measured. Existing conditions may be determined based on nameplate efficiency ratings of currently installed equipment. Alternatively, the Qualified Energy Engineer may use modeled energy performance of the building or other professionally accepted methods of establishing energy and water efficiency performance of the existing building.  

# 2. New Construction  

New construction Energy Conservation Projects, unlike existing-building retrofits, do not benefit from a history of pre-improvement energy usage data from which baseline energy usage can be established. Without the benefit of this baseline level of energy and water usage data, additional Energy Assessment requirements are necessary.  

Energy Conservation Projects within new construction projects are required to meet the State of Montana building code and exceed the code in some measurable manner. The baseline for new construction projects is the minimum level of equipment efficiency required by the current applicable building energy code or applicable ASHRAE standard. For any new construction project that follows the performance or prescriptive path, the Applicant must demonstrate through the Energy Assessment that the C-PACE Project exceeds the applicable IECC or equivalent ASHRAE standard established in the current State of Montana building code.  

# 3. Substantial Renovation/Adaptive Reuse of Vacant or Underutilized Buildings  

For Energy Conservation Projects that require substantial renovation or adaptive reuse of a vacant or underutilized building, the baseline for the purposes of establishing energy savings can be set based upon the level of the existing equipment and building conditions.  

Historic utility bills may be provided if available.  Otherwise, the Energy Assessment for this project type should include all other component requirements for existing building retrofit improvements, as outlined above. Energy savings for adaptive reuse and vacant buildings may be established using the appropriate energy assessment methodology determined by the Qualified Energy Engineer as set forth above, provided that the existing equipment will serve the same function as the end result of the project.  

# 4. Retroactive Improvements  

Previously completed installations of Energy Conservation Projects may be eligible for retroactive C-PACE financing.  Retroactive improvement financings are C-PACE Financings that close after the Energy Conservation Project was previously completed by the Record Owner. Applicants with retroactive improvements may apply to Last Best PACE to be approved for C-PACE Financing.  

Retroactive improvements are subject to the following additional requirements:  

• Must occur within thirty-six (36) months of the time elapsed between the later of the completion of the installation/modification or the certificate of occupancy for the Eligible Property and application of the C-PACE Financing, unless otherwise approved by the program. The term of the C-PACE Financing will be reduced to account for any of the Energy Conservation Project’s life that has elapsed between the time of installation/modification and the close of the retroactive C-PACE financing.  For example, if a retroactive C-PACE financing is funded one year after the later of either the completion of the installation/modification or the certificate of occupancy, the eligible term of the retroactive C-PACE financing will be reduced by one year.  

Required Documentation for Retroactive Improvements Financing:  

Verification is required to establish prior conditions (baseline) and describe the Energy Conservation Project. The Energy Assessment for a retroactive improvement shall include additional documentation that provides evidence of the Energy Conservation Project that is the subject of the retroactive C-PACE financing, as follows:  

Completion date for the Energy Conservation Project(s) that is subject to the retroactive CPACE financing   
• Make and model of equipment replaced and description of the baseline usage   
• Documentation that provides evidence of equipment installed prior to replacement   
• Make and model of equipment that is the subject of the retroactive improvement Documentation that provides evidence of installation/modification of equipment comprising the Energy Conservation Project(s)  

New construction projects that do not access C-PACE Financing until after the completion of the short-term construction period, may be considered a retroactive improvement.  

New construction projects that accessed C-PACE Financing earlier in the construction or conversion process must meet the new construction requirements, as outlined above.  

# 5. Renewable Energy Improvements  

For renewable energy improvement projects, a Renewable Energy Feasibility Study must be submitted by the Record Owner in addition to the Energy Assessment.  At a minimum, the Renewable Energy Feasibility Study should address the following:  

Site ambient conditions • Location for the Renewable Energy Improvement Utility consumption profile of the site, including the site’s historic energy use and cost Description of the proposed Renewable Energy Improvement Projected energy production Projected energy and financial cost savings to be generated by the Renewable Energy Improvement, including assumptions affecting the cost savings: $\bigcirc$ Weighted cost of energy saved and generated by the project $\bigcirc$ Cost savings to be realized from time-of-use and demand charge reductions $\bigcirc$ Utility tariff to be applied to the site and/or system following installation $\bigcirc$ Utility escalation rate assumptions o Tax benefits and other incentives $\bigcirc$ Expected useful life of the Renewable Energy Improvement $\bigcirc$ Maintenance expenses  

• Assessment of total project capital costs Applicable utility tariffs and type of interconnection (e.g., net metering) Appropriate requirements for system monitoring to maintain optimized performance  

At its sole discretion, the Authority may waive one or more required components of the Renewable Energy Feasibility Study.  

The Last Best PACE Program recognizes that developers and installers of Renewable Energy Improvements may be able to provide a qualifying Renewable Energy Feasibility Study to a Record Owner without engaging a Qualified Energy Engineer, as described in the Last Best PACE Contractor section of these Guidelines.  If this is the case, the name, company name, and credentials of the developer/installer shall be included in the Energy Assessment.  

# 6. Electric Vehicle Charging Systems  

An assessment of the benefits of the Electric Vehicle Charging System must be submitted by the Record Owner. This assessment must include but is not limited to:  

Description of the proposed Electric Vehicle Charging System   
Projected energy consumption of the Electric Vehicle Charging System   
Assessment of utility tariffs and interconnections issues   
A summary of the estimated implementation cost for the measure, the simple payback   
period in years, and the simple return on investment   
Assumptions affecting the analysis, including, but not limited to:   
$\bigcirc$ Utility and fuel cost escalation rate assumptions   
$\bigcirc$ Any tax benefits   
$\bigcirc$ Estimated useful life of the Electric Vehicle Charging System  

The energy generation baseline for all Electric Vehicle Charging Systems is an internal combustion engine used for transportation.  

The Last Best PACE Program recognizes that developers and installers of Electric Vehicle Charging Systems may be able to provide a qualifying Renewable Energy Feasibility Study to a Record Owner without engaging a Qualified Energy Engineer, as described in the Last Best PACE Contractor section of these Guidelines.  If this is the case, the name, company name, and credentials of the developer/installer shall be included in the Energy Assessment.  

# Energy Assessment Requirements  

The Energy Assessment for a C-PACE Project must follow a methodology consistent with standard ASHRAE guidelines, be calculated using generally accepted engineering calculations or a U.S. Department of Energy-approved building energy modeling software, and address the following components:  

• Written description of the proposed Energy Conservation Project Expected annual energy savings (kWh or therms), electrical demand reduction (kW), water savings (gallons or ccf), renewable energy capacity $(\mathrm{kW})$ , renewable electrical production (kWh) and operational cost $(\mathbb{S})$ savings Estimate of the useful life of each Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) that is part of the Energy Conservation Project The total project capital cost is required for each ECM or for packages of ECMs if interactive effects between the ECMs make itemized costs impractical Projected annual energy and water bill savings and operating cost assumptions Clear and logical documentation of assumptions for energy savings calculations o Document assumptions and inputs to calculations (e.g., hours of operation, equipment efficiencies, lighting power, controls, load factors, power factor, motor efficiencies, etc.) and use consistently throughout any calculations (as appropriate) o Key numbers should be easily identifiable (circled, bold, highlighted, etc.) with correct units shown  

A copy of proposed relevant equipment specs, data sheets, etc.  

# Cost Effectiveness  

An Energy Conservation Project must be cost effective to qualify for C-PACE Financing. The Last Best PACE Program considers a cost-effective project as one that benefits the Property Owner by ensuring the investment provides good value (for the money, for the project).  This value is typically demonstrated by the total cost of financing being exceeded by the projected monetary savings over the life of the improvement.  

The cost-effectiveness determination examines the value of energy and water utility bill savings, operational savings, additional revenue, rebates, renewable incentives, tax credits, and other savings and revenue mechanisms with respect to the value of the costs of purchasing and installing the improvements and any financing costs and associated fees for the Energy Conservation Project.  

To qualify as C-PACE eligible, projects involving equipment replacement or installation must be above base Montana code.  For the cost-effectiveness determination, the incremental savings resulting from the above-code measures must be greater than the incremental costs for the abovecode measures.  For example, if the incremental savings above-code for an HVAC system is greater than the costs for above-code measures, the full cost of the HVAC system is C-PACE eligible.  

Estimates of savings and costs must be adequately documented in the Energy Assessment to substantiate the values, which must be validated by the required Independent Third-Party Reviewer. The Last Best PACE Program reserves the right to request additional documentation to verify estimated costs and savings.  

# Qualifying Equipment  

Types of equipment that may qualify as part of an Energy Conservation Project:  

High efficiency heating, ventilating and air conditioning (“HVAC“) s   
• High efficiency chillers, boilers, and furnaces High efficiency water heating systems Energy management systems and controls   
? Distributed generation systems High efficiency lighting system upgrades Building enclosure and envelope improvements   
• Water conservation and wastewater recovery and reuse systems Combustion and burner upgrades   
• Heat recovery and steam traps   
? Water management systems and controls (“indoor and outdoor”) High efficiency irrigation equipment Solar energy systems  

Products or devices that are not permanently fixed to real property are ineligible to be part of an Energy Conservation Project.  Examples include, but are not limited to:  

Compact fluorescent and LED screw-in lamps   
• Plug load devices   
• Measures that are not permanently installed and can be easily removed Measures that save energy solely due to operational or behavioral changes   
• Power factor correction, power conditioning Any measure that does not result in energy savings, water savings, or renewable energy production Any measure that cannot be explained in terms of industry-standard engineering or scientific principles  

C-PACE Financing terms shall not exceed the expected life of the proposed Energy Conservation Project as described in the Energy Assessment. For projects that include multiple ECMs, the term of a C-PACE Financing should be the weighted average of useful life.  

# Last Best PACE Contractors  

Last Best PACE seeks to facilitate good, locally based jobs for contractors and their employees. The Last Best PACE Program requires C-PACE Projects be completed by qualified, reputable  

contractors with relevant demonstrated experience.  Within a C-PACE Project there are three processes that involve contractors:  

Energy Assessments • Project Installations Independent Reviews  

At a minimum, the general/lead contractor working on a C-PACE Project must be an approved Registered Contractor with the Last Best PACE Program. Registered general/lead contractors are strongly encouraged to be knowledgeable about the Last Best PACE Program.  

# Registered Contractor Application Process  

Contractor submits the Contractor Registration Form directly from www.LastBestPACE.com • Last Best PACE Program reviews the registration form to make final determination • Contractor is notified of final determination If approved, the contractor is added to the Registered Contractor list on the program’s website.  

# Required Contractor Criteria:  

Contractor or Company is registered with the Montana Secretary of State and licensed to do business in Montana Contractor or Company is not disbarred from working in Montana   
• Contractor or Company is bonded   
· Contractor or Company carries a minimum of $\$1$ million in liability insurance coverage Contractor or Company provides appropriate workers’ compensation insurance coverage   
• Contractor or Company has the following required licenses and certifications:   
• Contractors or Companies performing work in the below referenced areas must have one or more employees assigned to the project with one of the following:  

# o HVAC  

 Masters Plumber’s license EPA Section 608 Type 2 or 3 certification

 North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP)   
 Solar PV Installer Solar Thermal Installer  

# o Geothermal  

 International Ground Source Heat Pump Association (IGSHPA)   
 Accredited Driller Accredited Installer  

# Required Certifications for Energy Engineer Contractors (Energy Assessments and Independent Reviews)  

Registered Contractors must be Qualified Energy Engineers to complete Energy Assessments or Independent Reviews for the Last Best PACE Program.  A Qualified Energy Engineer is defined as a professional holding one or more of the following certifications:  

Building Energy Assessment Professional (BEAP) Building Energy Modeling Professional (BEMP)  

Certified Energy Manager (CEM) Certified Measurement and Verification Professional (CMVP) Certified Energy Auditor (CEA) Certified Commissioning Professional (CCP) • Certified Commissioning Authority (CxA) Building Commissioning Professional Certification $({\mathrm{BCxP}})$  

Other certifications not listed but deemed appropriate will be accepted and added to this list.  

A Registered Contractor with relevant demonstrated experience may also be approved by the Las Best PACE Program to conduct Energy Assessments.  

# Requirements for Project Installation Contractors  

Last Best PACE requires that C-PACE Projects be installed by experienced commercial contractors.  The Record Owner and C-PACE Lender are required to ensure that qualified, reputable contractors are chosen to perform the work on the C-PACE Project according to plans, specifications, and requirements set forth in these Guidelines.  

Installation contractors must register with the Last Best PACE Program and certify that they hold all of the required licenses to install the applicable ECMs.  Upon acceptance of the program terms and conditions and approval by the program, the installation contractor will become a Registered Contractor in the Last Best PACE Program.  

Note: Last Best PACE reserves the right to modify contractor qualifications.  Contractors will be notified of the new requirements.  

# Last Best PACE Process  

To start the process, the Record Owner will work with a Qualified Energy Engineer to conduct an Energy Assessment of the Eligible Property. The Energy Assessment for a C-PACE Project must address the components listed under the Energy Assessment Requirements section outlined in these guidelines. If the Record Owner requires a referral for a Qualified Energy Engineer, the Authority can provide a list.  

# Application  

Once the Energy Assessment is complete and supports the Cost Effectiveness of the Energy Conservation Project, the Record Owner can submit an Application, available at www.LastBestPACE.com.  

Based on the Application, the Last Best PACE Program may issue a preliminary communication indicating that, subject to verification of all requirements, the proposed project appears to meet program requirements.  

Engage with Registered Contractor for Energy Assessment Based on the program’s preliminary letter, the Record Owner may now engage with a contractor, if they have not already done so (see Prior to Application, above). The Last Best PACE Program can provide a listing of Registered Contractors that have met program criteria (found in the Last Best PACE Contractors section of these Guidelines), which the Record Owner may wish to contract with for their C-PACE Project. This list is provided as a service, however if a Record Owner works with another contractor, please remember that a contractor must become a Registered Contractor with the Last Best PACE Program.  

Note: Under MCA 90-4-1305, the Contractor must use a skilled and trained workforce. In addition, projects financed must require contractors and subcontractors to give preference to the employment of bona fide Montana residents, if the Montana residents have substantially equal qualifications to those of nonresidents.  

# Engage with Registered Contractor for Independent Review  

Once design of the project and a final calculation of the expected costs and savings is completed, a review by a qualified Independent Reviewer must occur to verify the Energy Conservation Project’s Cost Effectiveness. The Independent Review must be conducted by a licensed engineer with the relevant professional certifications that is a Registered Contractor with the Last Best PACE Program.  The Independent Reviewer is chosen by the Record Owner and cannot have a financial interest in the C-PACE Project. Alongside reviewing the Energy Assessment, the Independent Reviewer will include additional considerations of savings and costs as outlined below.  

Savings considered in the review include, but are not limited, to:  

Energy efficiency savings;   
• Water use reduction savings;   
• Estimated savings from renewable energy generation; Tax credits and deductions, rebates, grants and other incentives applicable to the qualifying improvements; Expected savings from improved efficiency in maintenance and operations; and Expected savings from using C-PACE financing in replacement of mezzanine debt or preferred equity.  

Costs considered in the review include, but are not limited, to:  

• The cost of the Energy Conservation Project, which can include the incremental increase in costs over a minimally code-compliant installation;   
• Materials and labor for installation of above;   
• Soft costs such as program fees, planning, and design; and   
• Loan interest and other expected financing fees.  

Estimates of savings and costs must be adequately documented. The Last Best PACE Program reserves the right to request additional documentation to verify estimated costs and savings.  

Obtain Mortgage Lender Consent   
The Record Owner shall obtain written consent in a form substantively similar to that of the Model Notice and Consent Agreement (Appendix J) from any mortgage holder prior to the issuance of C-PACE Financing. The Record Owner must provide:   
• An executed Notice and Consent Agreement, properly notarized and executed within three months prior to Application for a contract;   
A record of the Notice and Consent Agreement from the office of the County Clerk and Recorder in the county where the property is located; and   
• A secretary's certificate or substantially similar certification that the person who executed the Notice and Consent Agreement is authorized to sign such an agreement.  

# Secure Financing  

After receiving the Notice and Consent Agreement from any current mortgage holder (if applicable), the Record Owner will take the preliminary approval from the Last Best PACE Program as well as the information from the Independent Reviewer and secure a commitment from an Eligible Lender, as described in that section of these Guidelines. Under statute, the assessment payment period cannot exceed the useful life of the project that is the basis for the loan and assessment. The financing package may include soft costs such as program fees, planning, and design costs, as well as the cost of the Energy Assessment.  

# Loan Closing Document List  

Pre-closing documents that must be submitted (may occur following C-PACE Approval) prior to the close of the C-PACE Financing, are as follows:  

• Contract between Local Government and Record Owner (Appendix G) Contract between Local Government and Lender (Appendix H) PACE Assessment Lien (Appendix I) Notice and Consent Agreement (Appendix J) Borrower Acknowledgement of Risk and Certification as to Montana C-PACE Programmatic Requirements (Appendix M)  

# C-PACE Financing Closing  

Prior to closing on the C-PACE Financing, the Record Owner is required to provide to the Last Best PACE Program the following documentation:  

The Independent Reviewer’s report showing water or energy baseline conditions and the projected water or energy savings, or the amount of renewable energy generated attributable to the project;   
Documentation confirming there are no delinquent taxes, special assessments, or water or sewer charges due on the real property;   
Documentation confirming there are no delinquent assessments on the real property under any Commercial Property-Assessed Capital Enhancements program; and The Borrower Acknowledgement of Risk and Certification as to the Last Best PACE Programmatic Requirements certifying the Record Owner understands and accepts the terms of the contract and financing.  

With the Application and all supplemental documentation, the Last Best PACE Program will make a final determination that:  

• The Record Owner and the property are eligible to participate in the program; • The proposed improvements are reasonably likely to decrease energy or water consumption or demand; and • The period of the requested assessment does not exceed the useful life of the project.  

Upon the Last Best PACE Program’s determination of compliance, the C-PACE Lender can then notify the program and the Local Government that the Record Owner has demonstrated the ability to fulfill the financial obligations to be repaid through contractual assessments.  

# File Assessment  

Before entering a contract with a Record Owner under the program, the Local Government shall verify that delinquent taxes, special assessments, or water or sewer charges are not due on the real property, and that no delinquent assessments on the real property under a Commercial PropertyAssessed Capital Enhancements program are due.  

Once the program requirements are met, the Local Government will enter into a written contract with the Record Owner. The contract will impose a property tax assessment on the Record Owner’s Eligible Property to repay the Lender’s financing of the Energy Conservation Project. The Lender will file a “Notice of Contractual Assessment Lien,” in substantially the form in Appendix I in the Official Public Records of the County where the Eligible Property is located, as notice to the public of the assessment. The contract and the notice must contain the amount of the assessment, the legal description of the property, the name of the Record Owner, and a reference to the statutory assessment lien provided under the PACE Act.  

The execution of the written contract between the Local Government and the Record Owner and recording of the PACE Assessment Lien (Appendix I) incorporate the terms of the financing documents executed between the Record Owner and the Lender to repay the financing secured by the assessment.  The Lender will advance financing to the Record Owner, and the terms for repayment will be such terms as are agreed between the Lender and the Record Owner.  Under the form Lender contract attached in Appendix H the Lender or a designated servicer will agree to service the debt secured by the assessment.  

# Complete Project  

With funds from the Lender, the Record Owner can directly purchase the equipment and materials for the Energy Conservation Project and contract directly, including through lease, power purchase agreement, or other service contract, for the installation or modification of the improvements. Alternatively, the Lender may make progress payments to the Record Owner as the Energy Conservation Project is installed.  

# Verification Review  

As per MCA 90-4-1305, after an Energy Conservation Project is completed, the Last Best PACE Program requires the contractor who completed the project to submit written verification that it was properly installed and is operating as intended. Projects must be completed according to the design approved by the reviewer and in compliance with state and local building and energy code. If the design needs modification, the changes must be reviewed and approved by the Independent Reviewer.  The verification report conclusively establishes that the improvement is an Energy Conservation Project, and the project is qualified under the Last Best PACE Program.  

Change Orders  

All change orders that result in a substantial alteration of C-PACE funded improvements or related anticipated energy and water savings or resiliency benefits are required to be preapproved by the Last Best PACE Program to ensure that the changes to the project remain consistent with the requirements as set forth in the Program Guidelines. The Record Owner shall provide the following documentation:  

• Narrative description of the change in project scope and purpose for such a change;   
• Revised project budget to account for changes in project cost;   
• A letter from a Qualified Energy Engineer certifying that the revised improvements remain eligible for C-PACE Financing; and   
• Approval of the change by the C-PACE Lender.  

# Loan Repayment  

If applicable, the Local Government will deduct the fee for its services and remit the Record Owner’s assessment payments to the Authority for disbursement to the Lender to repay the debt. The C-PACE Lender has the right to assign or transfer the right to receive the installments of the debt secured by the assessment, provided all of the following conditions are met:  

• The assignment or transfer is made to an Eligible Lender, as defined above; and The Record Owner, the Local Government and the Last Best PACE Program are notified in writing of the assignment or transfer at least 30 days before the next installment is due according to the schedule for repayment of the debt.  This notification must include the address to which payment of the future installments should be mailed; and The assignee or transferee of the right to receive the payments executes an explicit written assumption of all of the Record Owner’s obligations under the C-PACE Lender contract.  

# Eligible Lenders  

C-PACE Projects are financed by lenders in an open market model.  The Last Best PACE Program relies on private capital to finance projects and does not obligate the State of Montana, the Authority, the Last Best PACE Program, or the Local Government to support or guarantee funding. The selection of the C-PACE Lender is up to the Record Owner.  

Participation in the Last Best PACE Program requires the Record Owner to work with an Eligible Lender to negotiate the terms of the C-PACE Financing.  C-PACE Lenders extend loans to finance Energy Conservation Projects. Financing documents executed between the Record Owners and CPACE Lenders impose a contractual assessment on Eligible Property to repay the Record Owner’s financing of the Energy Conservation Project. The C-PACE Lenders ensure the Record Owners demonstrate the financial ability to fulfill the financial obligation to be repaid through contractual assessments.  

The PACE Act does not set criteria for financial institutions or investors to be Last Best PACE Lenders. However, the Authority does follow best practices of other C-PACE programs by recommending that lenders be:  

• A federally insured depository institution, such as a bank, savings bank, savings and loan association, and federal or state credit union; • An insurance company authorized to conduct business in one or more states; • A Registered Investment Company (RIC), registered Business Development Company (RDC), or SBA Small Business Investment Company (SBIC);  

• A publicly traded entity; or   
• A private entity that: o Has a minimum net worth of $\$5$ million; and o Has at least three years’ experience in business or industrial lending or commercial real estate lending (including multifamily lending), or has a lending officer that has at least three years’ experience in business or industrial lending or commercial real estate lending; and o Can provide independent certification as to availability of funds;  

Eligible Lenders participating in the Last Best PACE program must be a financially stable entity with the ability to carry out, either directly or through a servicer, the bookkeeping and customer service work necessary to manage the assessment accounts.  

Emphasizing predictability and transparency, the Last Best PACE program does not allow balloon payments for C-PACE loans.  

C-PACE loans must be either:  

fixed rate for the full term of the financing, or variable rate with rate resets limited to every five years  

# Eligible Local Government C-PACE Districts  

The Last Best PACE Program is available to commercial Record Owners located in all communities within the State of Montana, subject to the applicable local government’s one-time election to participate in the program, by establishing a C-PACE District. A local government must authorize its participation in the Last Best PACE Program through adoption of a final C-PACE Resolution via the appropriate municipal process.  

Local governments are not responsible for and do not authorize participation in individual C-PACE Projects. The Last Best PACE Program will coordinate and support the efforts to assist each local government that wishes to opt-in to the program. Local governments interested in C-PACE should contact the program directly.  

In addition to the benefits the Record Owner receives by implementing energy-and water-saving measures, local governments also receive direct and indirect benefits, such as:  

Enhancement of the value and efficiency of existing buildings;   
Boost to the local economy by creating new job opportunities for laborers, new business opportunities for contractors, engineers, commercial lenders, professionals, equipment vendors, and manufacturers;   
Increases to business retention and expansion in the C-PACE District by enabling cost effective energy and water saving updates to existing properties;   
Increases to commercial building values which increases taxable property values; Improves productivity through optimized energy usage; and  

Better enables local governments to meet their water conservation goals.  

The Last Best PACE Program is designed to be self-sustaining and requires minimal support from the local government. Furthermore, because C-PACE is tax neutral, it achieves all the benefits without imposing a burden on the local government’s general fund. The program is designed to benefit all parties involved.  

Under MCA 90-4-1306, once a local government is interested in creating a C-PACE District, the local government must:  

1. Adopt a Resolution of Intent (Appendix K) that includes:  

a. a statement of intent to establish a C-PACE Program describing the role of the governing body and the role of the Authority in administering the program;   
b. the types of Energy Conservation Projects that may be included in the program;   
c. a reference to the program plan required by MCA 90-4-1305 and a location where the plan is available for public inspection; and   
d. the time and place for a public hearing on the proposed program;  

2. Hold a public hearing at which the public may comment on the proposed program and the program plan required by MCA 90-4-1305; and  

3. Adopt a Resolution Establishing a C-PACE Program (Appendix L) and setting the terms and conditions of the program, including:  

a. How the governing body will meet the program plan requirements established by the authority in MCA 90-4-1305. The resolution may incorporate the program plan or an amended version of the program plan by reference;   
b. A description of the aspects of the program that may be changed without a public hearing and the aspects that may be changed only after a public hearing;   
c. Identification of an official authorized to enter into a program contract on behalf of the local government with C-PACE Lenders; and   
d. Identification of an official authorized to enter into a program contract on behalf of the local government with Record Owners.  

# Program Fees  

The Last Best PACE Program reserves the right to modify its fee structure at any time due to changes to program requirements or market factors. Such modifications will be published in updates to the Program Guidelines.  

# Origination Fee  

The Origination Fee is paid to the Last Best PACE Program at or prior to the C-PACE Financing closing date. This fee represents an up-front administration fee that equals one and one quarter percent $(1.25\%)$ of the C-PACE Financing amount.  The minimum Origination Fee shall be $\$1,000$ , with no set maximum fee amount\*.  The Origination Fee may be capitalized into the CPACE Financing amount for the C-PACE Project.  

\*Note: MFFA reserves the right to negotiate a maximum origination fee amount on an individual project basis.  

# Administrative Fee  

For each current C-PACE Project, an Administrative Fee of one percent $(1.0\%)$ of the annual payment, up to an annual maximum of $\$3,000$ , will be charged each year until the assessment is paid in full.  This will be calculated and included in the project amortization schedule.  Upon receipt of the funds from the Local Government, the Last Best PACE Program will deduct the fee prior to remitting the loan payment to the C-PACE Lender.  

The Origination and Administrative fees outlined above do not include any specialized professional services that may be necessary should the circumstances of any particular C-PACE Project require them.  For example, and without limitation, should any participant in a C-PACE Project submit substantive comments to the Last Best PACE Program documentation, request a legal opinion from program counsel or require other time and resource intensive review of a transaction, the Record Owner shall be responsible for covering such Last Best PACE Program expenses at cost.  Prior to a C-PACE Financing closing, evidence that such expenses will be paid before the closing is required.  These specialized professional services expenses may be paid out of the proceeds of the C-PACE Financing.  

# Qualifying Expenses  

The following costs may be rolled into the C-PACE Financing Agreement:  

Energy audits/renewable energy studies • Equipment costs Installation costs Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs Feasibility costs Recording fees Energy evaluations Design, drafting, engineering, labor costs Permit fees Inspection charges Appraisal costs Other costs the Last Best PACE Program determines to be reasonable  

Self-installation costs do not qualify, and costs must be considered reasonable. The Last Best PACE Program evaluates costs on a case-by-case basis and may require additional documentation to validate reasonability.

# Appendix E: ASHRAE Audit and Engineering Commissioning and Verification Descriptions  

# ASHRAE Level I  

An ASHRAE Level I energy audit consists of 1) a walk-through analysis to assess a building’s energy cost, 2) a utility bill analysis to assess its efficiency (using ASTM BEPA Methodology or ASHRAE Preliminary Energy-Use Analysis (PEA) to establish the building’s baseline energy use), and 3) conducting a brief on-site survey of the building. The walk- through may be targeted at a specific building component that is intended to be replaced or upgraded or added (such as in the case of installing a solar energy system) or may include checking all major energy-using systems. Operational metrics of building equipment are typically limited to data collection of nameplates but may be more detailed if that data are readily available. Level I energy analysis should at the minimum identify ECMs and the associated potential energy savings, the estimated cost of the ECMs, and specify where further consideration and more rigorous investigation is warranted.  

# ASHRAE Level II  

An ASHRAE Level II energy audit is a more detailed investigation and includes a more comprehensive building survey and energy analysis than a Level I audit. It also includes more detailed financial analysis. In addition to nameplate data collection, empirical data may also be acquired through various field measurements using handheld devices. The Level II audit should at the minimum identify and provide the investment and cost savings analysis of all recommended ECMs that meet the owner’s constraints and economic criteria, along with a discussion of any changes to operation and maintenance procedures. Detailed financial analysis includes ROI, IRR, NPV and payback period determination reflecting C-PACE Financing. Sufficient detail on projected energy savings is provided to justify project implementation.  

# ASHRAE Level III  

The ASHRAE Level III energy audit (often referred to as an “investment grade audit”) is generally applicable to projects that are very capital intensive and demand more detailed field data gathering as well as more rigorous engineering analysis. The Level III energy audit provides even more comprehensive project investment and cost savings calculations to bring a higher level of confidence that may be required for major capital investment decisions. Data collection may involve field measurements acquired through data loggers and/or an existing energy management system.  

# Engineering Commissioning and Verification Requirements  

Engineering Commissioning and Verification of the ECMs’ remodeled/installed in the subject CPACE Project is to be performed by a qualified Engineer (engineering commissioning provider). The engineering commissioning provider is required to review the design, installation and performance of the remodeled/new building systems and compare to the energy assessment or study or model (Energy Assessment and/or Renewable Energy Feasibility Study) according to an industry accepted Commissioning guideline or Commissioning scope of work approved by the Authority. The final commissioned systems should be configured as modeled in the Energy Assessment and/or Renewable Energy Feasibility Study for the remodeled/new systems that are included in the scope of the subject C-PACE Project. The remodeled/new systems are to be reviewed and tested for proper function per specified design criteria and sequences. All deficiencies are to be communicated to the Record Owner and shall be resolved.

LENDER NOTICE  

# Date of Notice:  

# LENDER INFORMATION  

Lender Name: Attn: Lender Address:  

# PROPERTY / LOAN INFORMATION  

Property Owner: Owner Address: Loan Number:  

Property Address:  

Legal Description:  

# Why has the financial institution received this notice?  

The property owner wishes to install energy efficiency, water conservation, or renewable energy upgrades to the property using the Commercial Property-Assessed Capital Enhancements (CPACE) program. C-PACE requires any senior lenders who hold debt on the property to consent to the tax assessment.  

# What is C-PACE?  

C-PACE is an alternative financing mechanism for property upgrades that improve energy efficiency, conserve water, and/or utilize renewable energy. C-PACE makes it possible for qualified property owners to obtain low-cost, long-term financing funded by private capital providers. C-PACE is paid back via a special tax assessment on the property.  

# Why do lenders consent to C-PACE?  

# 1. Financed C-PACE Measures Reduce Building Operating Costs  

C-PACE projects are designed to save the property owner money by improving their energy systems. By making these improvements, the whole of the building is more energy efficient and cost effective.  

# 2. C-PACE Assessments Cannot be Accelerated  

While the full assessment amount is recorded on the property records, only the annual payment may be collected, even in a default situation. So much like with property taxes, senior lenders are only behind that annual assessment payment and not the full balance of the financing.  

# 3. Financed C-PACE Measures Improve Properties, Often Reducing Maintenance and Repair Costs  

Energy measures improve the efficiency, health, and comfort of a building making it more attractive to tenants and future owners. It also increases the property’s taxable value. CPACE projects make good business sense for the property owner because they are improving their assets, and therefore the property’s mortgage lender has improved collateral.  

# 4. C-PACE Financing Does Not Restrict a Senior Lender’s Foreclosure Rights  

Unlike other debt, C-PACE does not require an inter-creditor agreement. Rather, in the event of a default on the senior lender’s debt, the senior lender can foreclose on its mortgage interest in the property in the same manner as if it were the sole financing on the property. C-PACE does not affect any existing remedies under the loan documents.  The C-PACE capital provider may not prevent, restrict, or otherwise impact the senior lender’s foreclosure.  

# What else should your financial institution know?  

The property owner has indicated their intention to apply for C-PACE financing for the improvements outlined in Exhibit A. The Assessment is to be levied on the property pursuant to an agreement between the property owner, the capital provider for the C-PACE improvements, and the local unit of government processing the tax assessment.  

Upon the recording of the C-PACE assessment, all existing mortgage debt on the property will be subordinate to the C-PACE Assessment. The local unit of government, or its permitted assignee, can foreclose the C-PACE Assessment encumbering the property if the C-PACE assessment is not paid.  C-PACE Assessments cannot be accelerated.  Senior lenders are only behind the annual assessment payment and not the full balance of the financing.

• Provide project estimates of cost and savings Declare the property owner’s agreement to pay on a timely basis both the existing obligations secured by the property (including the Loan) and the proposed C-PACE Assessment

# Appendix M: Borrower Acknowledgement of Risk and Certification as to Montana C-PACE Programmatic Requirements  

I, (“Property Owner”), do hereby acknowledge and certify as follows: 1) That I have read and understood the following legal documents and have had the opportunity to obtain independent legal counsel regarding the same:  

a. The COMMERCIAL PROPERTY ASSESSED CAPITAL ENHANCEMENT (“C-PACE”) OWNER CONTRACT (“Owner Contract”) made as of the day of , by and between _, Montana (“Local Government”), and (“Property Owner”).  

b. THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY ASSESSED CAPITAL ENHANCEMENT (“C-PACE”) LENDER CONTRACT (the “Lender Contract”) made as of the day of , by and between (“Local Government”) and (“Lender”).  

c. NOTICE OF CONTRACTUAL ASSESSMENT LIEN PURSUANT TO COMMERCIAL PROPERTY ASSESSED CAPITAL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF MONTANA  

2) That the energy conservation measures financed via a third-party financing pursuant to the legal documents enumerated in Section 1 (the “C-PACE Loan”) above do constitute permanent cost-effective energy improvements fixed to real property of which I am the record owner.  

3) That the cost-effectiveness estimates of the financed energy conservation measures are based on current good faith estimates only and that the failure of such cost savings to materialize, in whole or in part, will in no way vitiate, void, annul, or mitigate my obligation to pay when due the semi-annual installments of the Assessments levied for purposes of repaying the C-PACE Loan.  

4) I understand that my only opportunity to cancel the Owner Contract was within three business days of signing the Owner Contract and do hereby represent that no such cancelation was intended by me nor did any such cancelation in fact occur.

6) I am entering into the C-PACE Loan based on my own independent determination that such C-PACE Loan constitutes an economically beneficial financial arrangement. In reaching this decision I have not relied on any representations of the Authority or the Local Government as to economic benefit and have sought independent advice to the extent I have deemed it reasonably necessary.  

7) There is no information of which I am aware which would in any way preclude the energy conservation measures to be financed by the C-PACE Loan from qualifying under the C-PACE Program Plan or C-PACE Program Guidelines.  

I declare under penalty of perjury and under the laws of the State of Montana that the foregoing is true and correct. DATED this ___ day of ____, 20___, in , Montana.
