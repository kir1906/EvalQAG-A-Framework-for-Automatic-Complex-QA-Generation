Be sure to download the Greenlots Application and sign in to your Account (linked to your SDG&E Power Your Drive Account).  

Search for the Station by typing in the station ID on the charge station cover and select “Go”.  

Push the button on the connector to lift it out of the holster.  

Plug the connector into your electric vehicle and make sure it is securely connected.  

Via the Greenlots Application push “Start Charge” and confirm your vehicle has begun to charge (there are often indicator lights on the dashboard to confirm your car is charging).  

When you get back to your vehicle simply unplug the connector and return it to the holster to end your session.
