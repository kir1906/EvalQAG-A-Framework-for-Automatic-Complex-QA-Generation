# EV Charger Rewards  

Electric Vehicle (EV) Charger Incentives  

Making EV Adoption More Accessible, Convenient & Affordable As our customers transition to electric vehicles, we will work to provide the necessary energy and charging solutions to meet the diverse charging needs and manage the overall impact to the electrical system.  

The EV charger rewards program incentivizes residential customers for allowing us to leverage their Level 2 EV smart chargers to make adjustments to their charging behavior during periods of high electric demand.  

· A Level 2 charger provides charging through a 240V AC plug and requires the installation of additional charging equipment by a licensed electrician/installer.   
· Level 2 chargers typically deliver 10 to 60 miles of range per hour of charging. They are used in homes, workplaces, and for some public charging.

Looking for general information on Electric Vehicles? Start here, with the Electric Vehicle FAQ page.  

In EV Charger rewards, Demand response events will be called by the Company during times of peak system demand throughout the year to reduce the electric vehicle charging load while encouraging customers to charge their vehicles during off-peak hours. Events can be for up to a four (4) hour period, with a maximum of 45 Energy Events per year (maximum of 15 per month). You may opt-out of any demand response event if you choose to do so via your charger or its associated app.  

In return, you willreceive $\$40$ after you have participated in the program for one year (after your anniversary date) If you remain enrolled, youwill receive $\$40$ after each anniversary.
