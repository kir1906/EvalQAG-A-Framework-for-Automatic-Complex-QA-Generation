# Electric Vehicle Charging Basics  

For most drivers, charging an electric car is as simple as charging a cell phone. In fact, it usually takes only around 5 seconds of your time to "refuel" your electric car. Why? Because most charging happens at home, overnight, while the driver sleeps. You just plug in your car when you get home and it's typically re-charged back to full before you even wake up the next morning. It's the car that "refuels" while you sleep! There are three levels of charging rate to choose from, depending upon your needs and lifestyle.

# Level 3 Charging  

FASTSPEED EX: Highway Rest Stop, Community Hub Charging  

Also known as public DC Fast Charging, Quick charging, and Supercharging. · Level 3 adds hundreds of miles of range per hour of charging. Charge in around 30 minutes or less.  

# Charging Equipment  

Every EV comes with a charging adapter that connects to a standard home outlet (also known as Level 1 charging). This is typically used overnight while you sleep and adds up to 50 miles of range in 12 hours, more than most people drive on a typical day. For some drivers, this may be adequate, especially if the vehicle is not driven much daily or is a plug-in hybrid electricvehicle(PHEV).  

Though not required, in order to get the most out of any plug-in car's electric mileage benefits, it is recommended to purchase a Level 2 home charging station. This wil recharge your EV five to ten times faster than Level 1, and allow even ones with large batteries to always fully charge overnight.  

The best time to get a Level 2 is just before taking delivery of your vehicle, so the equipment can be installed and ready for charging the moment you receive your electric car. Massachusetts requires all chargers to be ENERGY STAR Certified Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). To find and compare products, visit the   
ENERGYSTARwebsite.  

# Public Charging Equipment & Networks  

Charging in public can be a positive experience with a little bit of research and preparation in advance. There are many brands and models of public charging units, as well many different charging networks both nationally and regionally. Therearebasicallytwotypesofstations:  

Smart charging stations, also known as networked charging stations or connected stations. This typically requires either membership, a card, or an app to access. They may or may not have a fee. The three most common EV charging network providers are Tesla, Chargepoint and EVgo.  

Non-networked charging stations do not require any membership to activate and usually are free and just connect when you plug in, or may require an access code.  

Finding out in advance (for example by using PlugShare or another online resource or app) can help you explore what public charging is near you and get any advance set up out of the way from the comfort of home.  

# Charging Equipment Installation  

# Things to consider when choosing and installing your home EV charging station  

Home charging installation can be simple or reasonably complex. The cost can range from only a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the location of the house electrical panel and the proximity to the charging station or outlet. Be sure to hire a licensed and experienced electrician to upgrade your home electrical system. They will need to wire a 240-volt circuit, including a 50 or 60-amp circuit breaker, from your panel to a NEMA 14-50 outlet or a hard-wired wall-mounted charging station. Massachusetts also requires that you get an electrical permit. So, be sure to contact the town's building division, and file the proper form, etc.  

It is recommended to use all copper wiring and to hardwire a wall-mounted charging station as this seamless connection removes one potential point of failure. Importantly, by electrical code, 240-volt circuits may be required to have ground fault protected circuit breakers, but most EV charging stations have that incorporated in their design as well. This can cause nuisance circuit tripping, and you might wake to an uncharged Ev. If you hard wire the charger, you can avoid this issue by installing an unprotected circuit breaker. Be sure to alert your electrician to this possibility and share your equipment installation manual to verify that the circuit does not need additional ground fault protection.  

Typical Level 2 mobile charge cords that come with an EV at purchase are fine to plug in to a GFCl protected 240-volt outlet. If you choose this plug in method, be sure to install an upgraded commercial level outlet to safely carry a continuous 240-volts of power for 6-8 hours.  

When choosing a location, select a spot that is convenient for charging your EV. You should also consider the appropriate length of charging cord necessary to easily reach your parking spot. Charging units will vary in their cord length and can be selected to suit your needs.

If you don't already have a trusted local electrician, there are several turnkey services that will do a great job, but they tend to be more expensive. An electrician hired directly will probably be less costly, but don't let price be the only consideration. A proper electrical code rated system is the most important factor for safe home charging.
