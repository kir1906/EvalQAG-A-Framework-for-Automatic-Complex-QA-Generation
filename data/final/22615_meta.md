 ## Summary : 
 Marin Clean Energy (MCE), a Community Choice Aggregator, provides an incentive
for its customers to install renewable energy systems through the Feed-In
Tariff (FIT) Plus Program. MCE will pay for all energy, environmental
attributes, capacity, and if applicable, storage-related services and
attributes delivered by the system at a fixed rate based on metered energy
quantities multiplied by the applicable contract price for the delivery term.

The contract price is scheduled to step down over time as the installed
capacity of all participating systems increases. As of May 2024 there are 10.8
MW remaining on the 5th of 6 steps, with an energy price of $60 per MWh. All
systems must be paired with energy storage with a capacity equal to at least
180% of the AC inverter nameplate of the system. Storage must be of 4 hour
duration. See program website for complete details.
