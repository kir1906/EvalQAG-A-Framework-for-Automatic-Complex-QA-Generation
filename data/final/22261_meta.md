 ## Summary : 
 Under the [Climate Leadership and Community Protection
Act](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s6599) (CLCPA) of 2019,
New York has a mandate to deploy at least 9,000 MW of offshore wind capacity
by 2035. Although offshore wind capacity is considered in the procurement
targets set for other programs under [New York's Clean Energy
Standard](https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/5883/clean-
energy-standard), offshore wind capacity is procured separately.

The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA)
conducts competitive solicitations in order to secure Offshore Wind Renewable
Energy Certificates (ORECs). New York's offshore wind procurement strategy was
laid out in the [New York State Offshore Wind Master
Plan](https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Offshore-Wind/About-Offshore-
Wind/Master-Plan), and competitive solicitations were conducted in 2018, 2020,
2022, and 2023. Contracts awarded through these solicitations have a minimum
term of 20 years and a maximum term of 25 years. The 2018 solicitation
resulted in contracts for ORECs representing 1,696 MW of capacity, and the
2020 solicitation resulted in contracts for ORECs representing 2,490 MW of
capacity. The 2022 solicitation has provisionally awarded contracts for 4,032
MW of capacity, while the 2023 solicitation deadline was January 25, 2024.

Regulatory actions on the Offshore Wind Standard take place in the New York
Public Service Commission's [Case No.
18-E-0071](http://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/MatterManagement/CaseMaster.aspx?MatterCaseNo=18-e-0071).
