Applications for the Make Ready rebate program are currently open. The application window will remain open until funding is no longer available. Customers requesting rebates to be awarded in 2025 must complete construction by December 1, 2025.  

Clean Transportation  

Realizing the benefits of electric transportation depends on a strong infrastructure. Through the Make Ready Program, you can apply for rebates on the make ready infrastructure required to support electric transportation charging and connection systems at your company’s facilities.  

Make ready infrastructure refers to the electrical infrastructure required to support electric vehicle charging equipment behind your meter and up to, but not including the charger. We will provide rebates for customers on charging infrastructure that meet eligibility requirements. Customers are responsible for installation, operation, and maintenance of charging infrastructure behind the customer meter.  

\*Program terms and conditions apply. The Alabama Power Make Ready program has limited funds available. The open application period will depend on budget availability. If you have questions or are interested in turnkey EV charger installation services, contact our Business Service Center at 1-888-430-5787 or complete the Contact an ET expert form.  

To ensure you have what you need, please review our checklist before you start your application process.
