Easing the financial hurdles that are barring you from installing an automatic battery backup system at your home or business is the main goal of the VIBES program.  

VIBES is federally funded through the State Energy Program Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (SEPBIL), and is a rebate program that aims to limit the disruption that each power outage causes to daily life in the territory. The program gives residents the opportunity to receive up to $\$6,000$ in cash back on qualifying automatic battery backup systems as large as 21kWh. On top of helping residents keep the lights on when municipal energy generation goes offline, broad adoption of the types of batteries eligible for the VIBES rebate will help to strengthen the resiliency of the territory’s overall electrical grid and one day may reduce the number of blackouts.  

up to \$ 6K rebate for approved battery purchase.  

If you wish to become a vendor please reach out to kieshawne.green@eo.vi.gov.

# What to Know  

The first come first serve initiative has been funded with an initial $\$800,000$ grant through the State Energy Program Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (SEPBIL). To qualify for the program you must be a full time resident of the territory, own a home and or business/non-profit, and have an active Water and Power Authority (WAPA) bill in your name. Further, the automatic battery backup system must have a capacity between 3 kWh to 21 kWh. Equipment can be purchased either from a vendor on VIEO’s approved list, or from some other source. Please note, systems purchased from vendors outside of VIEO’s network of vetted suppliers will be subject to additional technical review by VIEO staff and an approved Electrical Final Certificate from the Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR) is required before the VIBES application process can begin.  

In order to be eligible for VIBES, you must be a full time resident of the territory with an active WAPA bill in your name, and be the owner of a condominium, or a single or multi family home. If you own a small business or non-profit, you may also apply. You must also have purchased a new and approved grid interactive battery energy storage system that provides automatic whole or partial home battery back up by means of either an automatic transfer switch or smart critical load panel from a local vendor. Finally, the system has to have been permitted by the Department of Planning and Natural Resources.
