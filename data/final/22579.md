The report must, to the extent possible and reasonable, itemize the actual and projected financial benefit to the public utility's ratepayers of each project. (q) By February 1, 2018, and each February 1 thereafter, the commissioner of management and budget shall submit a written report regarding the availability of funds in and obligations of the account to the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and house committees with jurisdiction over energy policy and finance, the public utility, and the advisory group. (r) A project receiving funds from the account must produce a written final report that includes sufficient detail for technical readers and a clearly written summary for nontechnical readers. The report must include an evaluation of the project's financial, environmental, and other benefits to the state and the public utility's ratepayers. A project receiving funds from the account must submit a report that meets the requirements of section 216C.51, subdivisions 3 and 4, each year the project funded by the account is in progress. (s) Final reports, any mid-project status reports, and renewable development account financial reports must be posted online on a public website designated by the commissioner of commerce. (t) All final reports must acknowledge that the project was made possible in whole or part by the Minnesota renewable development account, noting that the account is financed by the public utility's ratepayers. (u) Of the amount in the renewable development account, priority must be given to making the payments required under section 216C.417. (v) Construction projects receiving funds from this account are subject to the requirement to pay the prevailing wage rate, as defined in section 177.42 and the requirements and enforcement provisions in sections 177.27, 177.30, 177.32, 177.41 to 177.435, and 177.45.

# 116C.7792 SOLAR ENERGY PRODUCTION INCENTIVE PROGRAM.  

(a) The utility subject to section 116C.779 shall operate a program to provide solar energy production incentives for solar energy systems of no more than a total aggregate nameplate capacity of 40 kilowatts alternating current per premise. The owner of a solar energy system installed before June 1, 2018, is eligible to receive a production incentive under this section for any additional solar energy systems constructed at the same customer location, provided that the aggregate capacity of all systems at the customer location does not exceed 40 kilowatts.  

(b) The program is funded by money withheld from transfer to the renewable development account under section 116C.779, subdivision 1, paragraphs (b) and (e). Program funds must be placed in a separate account for the purpose of the solar energy production incentive program operated by the utility and not for any other program or purpose.  

(c) Funds allocated to the solar energy production incentive program in 2019 and 2020 remain available to the solar energy production incentive program. (d) The following amounts are allocated to the solar energy production incentive program: (1) $\$10,000,000$ in 2021; (2) $\$10,000,000$ in 2022; (3) $\$5,000,000$ in 2023; and (4) \$5,000,000 \$11,250,000 in 2024.; and (5) \$6,250,000 in 2025.  

(e) Notwithstanding the Department of Commerce's November 14, 2018, decision in Docket No. E002/M-13-1015 regarding operation of the utility's solar energy production incentive program, half of the amounts allocated each year under paragraph (d), clauses (3), (4), and (5), must be reserved for solar energy systems whose installation meets the eligibility standards for the low-income program established in the November 14, 2018, decision or successor decisions of the department. All other program operations of the solar energy production incentive program are governed by the provisions of the November 14, 2018, decision or successor decisions of the department.  

(e) (f) Funds allocated to the solar energy production incentive program that have not been committed to a specific projec at the end of a program year remain available to the solar energy production incentive program.  

(f) (g) Any unspent amount remaining on January 1, 2025 2028, must be transferred to the renewable development account.  

(g) (h) A solar energy system receiving a production incentive under this section must be sized to less than 120 percent of the customer's on-site annual energy consumption when combined with other distributed generation resources and subscriptions provided under section 216B.1641 associated with the premise. The production incentive must be paid for ten years commencing with the commissioning of the system.  

(h) (i) The utility must file a plan to operate the program with the commissioner of commerce. The utility may not operate the program until it is approved by the commissioner.
