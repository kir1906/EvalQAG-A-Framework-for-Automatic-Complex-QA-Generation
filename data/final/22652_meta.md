 ## Summary : 
 Commercial Property-Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) financing effectively
allows property owners to borrow money to pay for energy improvements. The
amount borrowed is typically repaid via a special assessment on the property
over a period of years. Idaho authorized local governments to establish such
programs through [H.B.
624](https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2024/legislation/H0624/)
(2024).
