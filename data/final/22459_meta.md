 ## Summary : 
 Community Solar in the state of Maine is governed by by [P.L. 2019 c.
478](http://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/bills_129th/chapters/PUBLIC478.asp),
[P.L. 2021
c.390](https://legislature.maine.gov/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=HP0692&item=6&snum=130),
and [Chapter 313](https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/rules/65/407/407c313.docx) of
the Public Utility Commissions (PUC) rules. These rules govern the state's Net
Energy Billing (NEB) Policy. Under NEB there are two programs which customers
can participate in "Community" or shared renewable projects, a kWh credit
program, which is available to all electric utility customers, and a tariff
rate program, which is available to non-residential customers.  

**Net Energy Billing kWh Credit Program**

The kWh program allows customers to choose to participate in a larger project
on a “shared” basis with other customers. These projects provide kWh credits
on participating customers' electricity bills at the retail kWh rate.

Projects less than 5 MW in capacity are eligible for the program. By 2025,
projects with a capacity between at least 1 MW and max 2 MW can be used under
the kWh Credit Program if the system is commercially operational by the date
specified in a net energy billing agreement or an amended agreement. Projects
between more than 2 MW and max 5 MW have similar participatory exceptions and
more.

**Net Energy Billing Tariff Rate Program**

The Tariff Rate Program, for non-residential customers, provides dollar
credits on participating customers' electricity bills. Rates are determined
annually by the PUC. For current rates used to determine the monthly credit,
please see the [Net Energy Tariff Rates](https://www.maine.gov/mpuc/regulated-
utilities/electricity/neb) on PUC's website.

After 2023, a project may be used for the Tariff Rate Program if it is
collocated with all the associated customers, and that those customers are
subscribed to 100% of the output. This rule does not apply to projects with a
net energy billing agreement that was executed before 2024.

Key features of the NEB program:

  * NEB programs allow customers to offset their electricity bills using the output from small renewable generators.
  * Customers may own their own project or share in a project with other customers.
  * The generation facility may be located on the customer’s property or on another property within the same utility service territory.
