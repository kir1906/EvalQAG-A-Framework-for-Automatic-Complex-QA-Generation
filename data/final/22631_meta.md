 ## Summary : 
 **_Note:[The Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf#page=993)
created the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/) with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

The Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) is the lead agency for Nevada's
NEVI Plan. Nevada's initial[NEVI
Plan](https://www.dot.nv.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/20723/637947099699800000)
was submitted to the federal Joint Office of Energy and Transportation in July
2022, and its [2023
Update](https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3A01fc8f44-9f94-39ea-
ba70-6f68619cbeb7&viewer%21megaVerb=group-discover) was submitted in August
2023. Nevada's goal is for all interstates in Nevada to achieve “Fully Built-
Out” status.

In years 1 and 2, NDOT approved two new stations in collaboration with NV
Energy’s Transportation Electrification Programs, and upgrades at three
existing rural stations. In year 3, NDOT plans to make NEVI funds available to
private partners through grant opportunities. Interested parties should visit
NDOT's website and sign up for NDOT's NEVI Program Partnering Directory.
