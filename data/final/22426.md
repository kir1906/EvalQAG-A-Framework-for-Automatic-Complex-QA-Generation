# Benefits of Community Solar  

Community solar is a new program that allows all types of electric customers to support the development of solar in New Mexico. Community solar offers usually save customers money compared to the amount they are already paying for electricity.  

# Open to All Types of Electric Customers  

Community solar allows electric utility customers to benefit from solar energy, even if they cannot put panels on their own rooftop. Community solar is a great option for renters, homeowners, businesses, nonprofits, schools, and other types of electric customers. Currently, community solar is open to customers only in the following utility territories: El Paso Electric, Public Service of New Mexico, and Southwestern Public Service.

# Renters  

Community solar allows renters and others who do not own roof space to subscribe to a   
share of a   
community solar project built in   
their utility   
territory. Plus,   
most community solar offers allow renters to transfer their community  

# Homeowners  

Rooftop or   
residential solar is a great fit for   
many homes, but not all. Some roofs do not face   
enough sunlight or have too much   
shading.   
Community solar is available to   
homeowners who cannot or choose not to install solar.  

# Businesses, Organizations, and Public Buildings  

Businesses, nonprofits, and public buildings can also participate in community solar. Community solar subscriptions are linked to the utility account, so even if you do not own solar subscription with them to a new address! Check your Disclosure & Consent Form for more information on taking your subscription with you to a new address.  

Homeowners may also prefer   
community solar because it does   
not have an   
upfront cost, like residential solar   
does.  

your building, you can still participate in community solar.  

# Save on your Electric Bill  

When you participate in community solar you subscribe to a portion of a community solar project. Your subscription size is based on your average annual electric usage. Every month the community solar project will produce electricity, and you will receive credits on your electric bill for the electricity produced by your subscription.  

# If you enroll in community solar, you will receive two monthly bills:  

1. Electric Bill: You will still pay monthly electric utility bills to your electric utility. Your electric utility bills will have credits for the solar energy produced by your community solar subscription. These credits will reduce what you owe to your electric utility.

2. Community Solar Bill: You will pay a second bill to your community solar provider for the electricity generated by your subscription during the month.  

Community solar companies typically offer savings compared to what you already pay to your utility. However, confirm that your utility rate is compatible with community solar. Some programs such as Time of Use (TOU) or Time of Day (TOD) pricing may impact your ability to save money with community solar. If you have questions about how enrolling in community solar will impact your electric bill, contact your utility provider.  

# Support Local Solar  

Community solar companies are required to enroll subscribers that live within the same utility territory as the community solar project. All projects are built in New Mexico and support the local solar job force. By signing up for community solar, you are helping New Mexico meet its clean energy goals.  

New Mexico’s Community Solar Program is helping to modernize and decarbonize New Mexico’s electric grid. The Program also generates significant investment in the state.
