# Buildings and Land Use  

As the physical environment changes, ensuring that land use regulations and buildings codes consider future conditions will be key in enhancing the City’s resilience, especially in the built environment. In order to meet present and future needs, land use and building codes must allow for adaptability and be informed by the best available climate and sea level rise projections. In addition, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector and save money, the City is improving energy efficiency through retrofits, LEED requirements, and encouraging green buildings.

# Land Use  

Miami 21, City of Miami's zoning code, takes a holistic, New Urbanism approach to land use and urban planning by emphasizing a denser, more walkable urban core. Amending Miami 21 is one way the City is ensuring that Miami is future-ready.  

Amendments to Miami 21 in response to climate change and sea level rise include:  

Density bonuses offered for exceeding green building certification levels (as per Section 3.14.3 of Miami 21 (https://codehub.gridics.com/us/fl/miami)   
Expanding freeboard elevation allowances to provide greater protection from storm surge as the seas rise.   
Incorporating resilience reviews when approving special area plans.
