Eligibility will be based on a variety of factors including household income. Income Qualification is based on your Area Median Income (AMI), a statistic used by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to determine eligibility for federal housing programs. AMI is the midpoint of a region’s income distribution, where half of the families earn more than the median and half earn less.varies across the state, and is both location-dependent and based on household size. When you look up the AMI, make sure to look at where you live, what your income is, and how many people reside in your household. The AMI is updated by HUD annually. Households above $150\%$ AMI are not eligible for this program.

# The HOMES Program  

The HOMES program is intended to provide performance-based rebates for comprehensive home energysaving retrofits, with the rebate amount depending on the level of energy savings achieved. This will be a comprehensive effort to examine homes and multifamily residences to identify their specific energy efficiency needs. Our experts analyze applicants’ homes to craft the best solution for their specific needs. Based on verification of income, some homeowners may be eligible for specific programs, but not for others. HOMES will be available later in the first quarter of 2025.

# What are the Next Steps and How Can I Stay Informed?  

Efficiency Arizona includes deploying resources and professionals statewide to reach as many eligible Arizona residents as possible. We’re developing a whole-home approach that includes more than just replacing equipment. Due to the very specific guidelines of these federally funded programs, we will work to craft solutions that combine various sources of funding to help homeowners achieve their efficiency goals.
