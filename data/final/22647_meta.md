 ## Summary : 
 **_Note: The[Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf#page=993)
created the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program ](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/)with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

Michigan released the selection results for Round 1 of its NEVI funding in
April 2024; this round allocated roughly $22.7 million. Michigan plans to
release a Request for Proposals for a [second round of
funding](https://www.michigan.gov/mdot/business/contractors/innovativecontracting/national-
electric-vehicle-infrastructure-2) in August 2024, with roughly $27 million to
be allocated. More details on Michigan's NEVI process can be found in the
