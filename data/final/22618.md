# THEFUTUREOFWINDINVIRGINIA  

As the state experiences an unprecedented boom in Al and data center infrastructure, maintaining our position as the best state for business requires addressing the subsequent unprecedented power demand.  

Wind energy, with its potential for sustainable and clean power generation, could play an important role in meeting these needs. However, global supply chain issues and reliance on foreign imports pose significant risks to our energy security. Recognizing this, Virginia is committed to developing strategic partnerships and investing in domestic solar manufacturing to reduce dependence on foreign sources.  

As part of Governor Youngkin's all-American, all-of-the-above energy plan, wind energy is integrated alongside other energy sources like nuclear and natural gas to ensure a reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean energy future for Virginia.This approach not only addresses energy demands and helps ustoremain responsible environmental stewards, but it also strengthens our energy independence and security.

# OFFSHOREWINDINVIRGINIA  

Most of state's wind energy potential lies offshore, where state boasts significant wind resources along its Atlantic coast. Virginia's first offshore wind farm, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, is owned and operated by Dominion Energy and is located 27 miles off the shores of Virginia Beach. The project is slated for completion in 2026 and will consist of 176 turbines, support 1,000 jobs, and provide emission-free power for up to 660,000 homes.
