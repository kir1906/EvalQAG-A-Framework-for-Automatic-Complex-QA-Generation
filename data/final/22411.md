# EV 101  

# Levels of Charging  

– Level 1 (Approximately 8-20 hours) – J1772 o Uses ordinary household current with a standard outlet (120V)  

– Level 2 (Approximately 4-8 hours) – J1772 Supplies 240V, like for an electric dryer or ove

4 Types of Connectors  

– Direct Current Fast Charger (DCFC) (Less than 20 minutes for an $80\%$ charge) – CCS/CHAdeMO o Supplies 480V  

# Vehicle Types  

Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) Can use Level 1, Level 2 or DCFC   
Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) Mainly only use Level 1 or Level 2

# New York State Goals  

# s part of the NY Climate Act, NYS’s goal is to have 850,000 EV’s on the road by 2025  

– Long Island’s portion is $21\%$ of the goal (tied to vehicle registration) – 178,500 EV’s by 2025 o As of Feb 2023, there are 38,000 EVs on LI $21\%$ of goal)  

• New York State’s fiscal year 2022-2023 budget established a nation-leading commitment for all new school buses purchased to be zero emission by 2027 and all school buses in operation to be electric by 2035.  

New York has signed onto the Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) rule  

– The legislation sets a statutory goal for all new light-duty vehicles sold in the Empire State to be zeroemissions by 2035 and all new medium-and heavy-duty vehicles by 2045.  

# PSEG Long Island’s Efforts to Date  

# Electric Vehicle Make Ready Program  

– Offers incentives to developers/customers to install public/private EV charging stations to help promote adoption of electric lig duty vehicles (LDV)   
– Help ease fears of range anxiety   
– Offer higher incentives for fast charging stations and for those installed in Low-Income / Disadvantaged Communities   
– Funding out to 2025, with a goal to add 4,247 Level 2 ports, and 498 DCFC ports on Long Island  

# Medium-duty and Heavy-duty Vehicle (MHDV) Make-Ready Study  

Commissioned in Feb 2023   
Identified the existing MHDV fleets on Long Island   
Policies and Market Trends that show how quickly vehicles will electrify Grid Impacts and Energy Requirements to serve these vehicles Indicates how many electric MHDV’s will be on the road in the future Will help PSEGLI develop a program specific to fleets in the 2023 Utility 2.0 Filing  

# Fleet Advisory Services RFP  

Solicitation currently out to procure a web-based tool that customers/fleet operators can use to assess their fleet electrification plans – Aiming for this to be available Q3 2023

# What is it?  

# • Authorized under 2020 DPS Order (Case 18-E-0138)  

– Orders NYS Utilities to offer incentives to developers to promote EV adoption   
– Contributes to NYS Climate Act (aka CLCPA) goals   
– EV Adoption necessary to meet State goal of 850,000 EVs = 178,500 registered EVs on Long Island by end of 2025 $(21\%)$   
– As of Feb 2023, there are 38,000 EVs on LI $(21\%$ of goa  

Our program is similar in setup to the NY Joint Utility Make Ready Program  

Funding through 2025 • Port targets through 2025: – 4,247 L2 Ports 498 DCFC Ports  

# Program Goals  

• Build the Charging Station Infrastructure to animate EV adoption on Long Island  

• Reduce Concerns about range anxiety and provide incentives for developers to install charging stations  

• Geographically optimize where chargers are installed and ensure they serve all of our communities  

• Key considerations include charger type, quantity of charger & ports, power output, location, and communities served  

Benefit ratepayers across the territory, targeting equitable return on investment – Service territory covers Far Rockaway, Nassau, and Suffolk

Incentives to install charging stations  

# EV Make Ready Study  

In 2020, PSEGLI conducted a study with a $3^{\mathrm{rd}}$ party to determine what EV adoption looked like presently, what it would look like in the future, where people drive, and where chargers had to be installed

Incentive Formula  

Calculated Incentive $=$ ((USMR + CSMR) \* Tier $\%$ ) – USMR  

– The actual incentive is the lesser of the calculated incentive and incentive cap   
Paid upon site energization  

• L2 Cash incentives paid following completion of energization  

DCFC  

– Lease-to-Buy Model for large sites CSMR equipment will be capitalized by LIPA over 10 year term which will then be handed back to the customer • Customer agrees to maintain CSMR equipment during term  

# • Hybrid Sites (Mix of L2 & DCFC)  

Cash Rebate or Lease-to-Buy driven by port majority and total project cost (case-by-case basis)

# Operational Requirements  

Station data collection for minimum of 5 years  

# EnergyHub  

– Fee structure of station   
– Total charging revenues per year   
– Operating costs per year   
– Daily Number of charging sessions per year with start and stop time, peak kW, total kWh   
– Port outage information (Reliability)  

$95\%$ Up-Time annually per port

• $99\%$ Up-Time annually per station, minimum of $50\%$ of the ports available  

• Public sites accepting payment must accept a universal form of payment  

– Example: Cash, credit card readers, call toll-free number, or QR codes that connect directly to a payment site   
– A mobile app cannot be the only way to pay o If you go to a gas station, you do not need a mobile app to pay for gas and you shouldn’t either to charge your EV   
– Public stations that can’t comply with this may be deemed a private station which may yield a $50\%$ incentive tier

– For stations that energize in 2023, each plug is eligible for a maximum of $\$5,000$ (must output $75\mathsf{k W+}$ ) Each year-after, the incentive decreases by $\$1000$ /plug • Program runs until the end of 2025, meaning that stations energized in 2023 would have 3 years of available incentive  

# Alternative fuels and electric vehicle recharging property credit (NYS Tax Credit)  

– The credit for each installation of property is equal to the lesser of $\$5,000$ or $50\%$ of the cost of property less any cost paid from the proceeds of grants that:  

o is located in New York State;   
o is used $50\%$ or more during the tax year in a trade or business carried on in New York State;   
o constitutes alternative fuels vehicle refueling property or electric vehicle refueling property; and   
has not been paid for from the proceeds of grants awarded before January 1, 2015, including grants from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority or the New York Power Authority.  

# Inflation Reduction Act  

– For commercial uses, the tax credit Is $6\%$ with a maximum credit of $\$100,000$ per unit (up from $\$30,000$ per property). The equipment must be placed in a low-income community or non-urban area.
