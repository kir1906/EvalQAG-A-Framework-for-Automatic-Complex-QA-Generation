C.48:3-87.8  Energy storage analysis; report.  

1. a. No later than one year after the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et al.), the Board of Public Utilities, in consultation with PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., the independent system operator, shall, together with stakeholders including but not limited to third party suppliers and electric public utilities, conduct an energy storage analysis and submit a written report to the Governor and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), to the Legislature concerning energy storage needs and opportunities in the State.  In conducting this analysis, the board shall:  

(1) consider how implementation of renewable electric energy storage systems may benefit ratepayers by providing emergency back-up power for essential services, offsetting peak loads, and stabilizing the electric distribution system; (2) consider whether implementation of renewable electric energy storage systems would promote the use of electric vehicles in the State, and the potential impact on renewable energy production in the State; (3) study the types of energy storage technologies currently being implemented in the State and elsewhere; (4) consider the benefits and costs to ratepayers, local governments, and electric public utilities associated with the development and implementation of additional energy storage technologies; (5) determine the optimal amount of energy storage to be added in the State over the next five years in order to provide the maximum benefit to ratepayers; (6) determine the optimum points of entry into the electric distribution system for distributed energy resources; and (7) calculate the cost to the State’s ratepayers of adding the optimal amount of energy storage.  

In conducting the analysis required by this subsection, the board shall also consider the need for integration of distributed energy resources into the electric distribution system and how distributed energy resources may be incorporated into the electric distribution system in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.  

b. In conducting the energy storage analysis required by this section, the board shall consult with the Laboratory for Energy Smart Systems in the Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation at Rutgers, The State University, and public and private entities in the State and in other states that have conducted studies concerning, or are implementing technologies for, energy storage and distributed energy resources.  

c. The written report shall:  (1) summarize the analysis conducted pursuant to subsection a. of this section; (2) discuss and quantify the potential benefits and costs associated with increasing opportunities for energy storage and distributed energy resources in the State; and (3) recommend ways to increase opportunities for energy storage and distributed energy resources in the State, including any recommendations for financial incentives to aid in the development and implementation of these technologies by public and private entities in the State.  

d. No later than six months after completion of the report, the board shall initiate a proceeding to establish a process and mechanism for achieving the goal of 600 megawatts of energy storage by 2021 and 2,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030.  

# P.L.2018, CHAPTER 17 2  

2. Section 38 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-87) is amended to read as follows:  

C.48:3-87  Environmental disclosure requirements; standards; rules.  

38. a. The board shall require an electric power supplier or basic generation service provider to disclose on a customer's bill or on customer contracts or marketing materials, a uniform, common set of information about the environmental characteristics of the energy purchased by the customer, including, but not limited to:  

(1) Its fuel mix, including categories for oil, gas, nuclear, coal, solar, hydroelectric, wind and biomass, or a regional average determined by the board;  

(2) Its emissions, in pounds per megawatt hour, of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and any other pollutant that the board may determine to pose an environmental or health hazard, or an emissions default to be determined by the board; and  

(3) Any discrete emission reduction retired pursuant to rules and regulations adopted pursuant to P.L.1995, c.188.  

b. Notwithstanding any provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the board shall initiate a proceeding and shall adopt, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, after notice and opportunity for public comment and public hearing, interim standards to implement this disclosure requirement, including, but not limited to:  

(1) A methodology for disclosure of emissions based on output pounds per megawatt hour;  

(2) Benchmarks for all suppliers and basic generation service providers to use in disclosing emissions that will enable consumers to perform a meaningful comparison with a supplier's or basic generation service provider's emission levels; and  

(3) A uniform emissions disclosure format that is graphic in nature and easily understandable by consumers.  The board shall periodically review the disclosure requirements to determine if revisions to the environmental disclosure system as implemented are necessary.  

Such standards shall be effective as regulations immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law and shall be effective for a period not to exceed 18 months, and may, thereafter, be amended, adopted or readopted by the board in accordance with the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act."  

c. (1) The board may adopt, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, after notice and opportunity for public comment, an emissions portfolio standard applicable to all electric power suppliers and basic generation service providers, upon a finding that:  

(a) The standard is necessary as part of a plan to enable the State to meet federal Clean Air Act or State ambient air quality standards; and  

(b) Actions at the regional or federal level cannot reasonably be expected to achieve the compliance with the federal standards.  

(2) By July 1, 2009, the board shall adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), a greenhouse gas emissions portfolio standard to mitigate leakage or another regulatory mechanism to mitigate leakage applicable to all electric power suppliers and basic generation service providers that provide electricity to customers within the State.  The greenhouse gas emissions portfolio standard or any other regulatory mechanism to mitigate leakage shall:  

(a) Allow a transition period, either before or after the effective date of the regulation to mitigate leakage, for a basic generation service provider or electric power supplier to either meet the emissions portfolio standard or other regulatory mechanism to mitigate leakage, or to transfer any customer to a basic generation service provider or electric power supplier that meets the emissions portfolio standard or other regulatory mechanism to mitigate leakage.  If the transition period allowed pursuant to this subparagraph occurs after the implementation of an emissions portfolio standard or other regulatory mechanism to mitigate leaka ge, the transition period shall be no longer than three years; and  

(b) Exempt the provision of basic generation service pursuant to a basic generation service purchase and sale agreement effective prior to the date of the regulation.  

Unless the Attorney General or the Attorney General's designee determines that a greenhouse gas emissions portfolio standard would unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce or would be preempted by federal law, the adoption by the board of an electric energy efficiency portfolio standard pursuant to subsection g. of this section, a gas energy efficiency portfolio standard pursuant to subsection h. of this section, or any other enhanced energy efficiency policies to mitigate leakage shall not be considered sufficient to ful fill the requirement of this subsection for the adoption of a greenhouse gas emissions portfolio standard or any other regulatory mechanism to mitigate leakage.  

d. Notwithstanding any provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the board shall initiate a proceeding and shall adopt, after notice, provision of the opportunity for comment, and public hearing, renewable energy portfolio standards that shall require:  

(1) that two and one-half percent of the kilowatt hours sold in this State by each electric power supplier and each basic generation service provider be from Class II renewable energy sources;  

(2) beginning on January 1, 2020, that  21 percent of the kilowatt hours sold in this State by each electric power supplier and each basic generation service provider be from Class I renewable energy sources.  The board shall increase the required percentage for Class I renewable energy sources so that by January 1, 2025, 35 percent of the kilowatt hours sold in this State by each electric power supplier and each basic generation service provider shall be from Class I renewable energy sources, and by January 1, 2030, 50 percent of the kilowatt hours sold in this State by each electric power supplier and each basic generation service provider shall be from Class I renewable energy sources.  Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, the board shall ensure that the cost to customers of the Class I renewable energy requirement imposed pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed nine percent of the total paid for electricity by all customers in the State for energy year 2019, energy year 2020, and energy year 2021, respectively, and shall not exceed seven percent of the total paid for electricity by all customers in the State in any energy year thereafter.  In calculating the cost to customers of the Class I renewable energy requirement imposed pursuant to this subsection, the board shall not include the costs of the offshore wind energy certifica te program established pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection.  The board shall take any steps necessary to prevent the exceedance of the cap on the cost to customers including, but not limited to, adjusting the Class I renewable energy requirement.  

An electric power supplier or basic generation service provider may satisfy the requirements of this subsection by participating in a renewable energy trading program approved by the board in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection;  

(3) that the board establish a multi-year schedule, applicable to each electric power supplier or basic generation service provider in this State, beginning with the one -year period commencing on June 1, 2010, and continuing for each subsequent one-year period up to and including, the one-year period commencing on June 1, 2033, that requires the following  

# P.L.2018, CHAPTER 17  

number or percentage, as the case may be, of kilowatt-hours sold in this State by each electric power supplier and each basic generation service provider to be from solar electric power generators connected to the distribution system in this State:

No later than 180 days after the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et al.), the board shall adopt rules and regulations to close the SREC program to new applications upon the attainment of 5.1 percent of the kilowatt-hours sold in the State by each electric power supplier and each basic generation provider from solar electric power generators connected to the distribution system.  The board shall continue to consider any application filed before the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et al.).  The board shall provide for an orderly and transparent mechanism that will result in the closing of the existing SREC program on a date certain but no later than June 1, 2021.  

No later than 24 months after the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et al.), the board shall complete a study that evaluates how to modify or replace the SREC program to encourage the continued efficient and orderly development of solar renewable energy generating sources throughout the State.  The board shall submit the written report thereon to the Governor and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), to the Legislature. The board shall consult with public utilities, industry experts, regional grid operators, solar power providers and financiers, and other State agencies to determine whether the board can modify the SREC program such that the program will:  

- continually reduce, where feasible, the cost of achieving the solar energy goals set forth in this subsection;  

-  provide an orderly transition from the SREC program to a new or modified program; - develop megawatt targets for grid connected and distribution systems, including residential and small commercial rooftop systems, community solar systems, and large scale behind the  

# P.L.2018, CHAPTER 17  

meter systems, as a share of the overall solar energy requirement, which targets the board may modify periodically based on the cost, feasibility, or social impacts of different types of projects; -  establish and update market-based maximum incentive payment caps periodically for each of the above categories of solar electric power generation facilities;  

-  encourage and facilitate market-based cost recovery through long-term contracts and energy market sales; and  

-  where cost recovery is needed for any portion of an efficient solar electric power generation facility when costs are not recoverable through wholesale market sales and direct payments from customers, utilize competitive processes such as competitive procurement and long-term contracts where possible to ensure such recovery, without exceeding the maximum incentive payment cap for that category of facility.  

The board shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove any application for designation as connected to the distribution system of a solar electric power generation facility filed with the board after the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et al.), no more than 90 days after receipt by the board of a completed application.  For any s uch application for a project greater than 25 kilowatts, the board shall require the applicant to post a notice escrow with the board in an amount of $\$40$ per kilowatt of DC nameplate capacity of the facility, not to exceed $\$40,000$ .  The notice escrow amount shall be reimbursed to the applicant in full upon either denial of the application by the board or upon commencement of commercial operation of the solar electric power generation facility.  The escrow amount shall be forfeited to the State if the facility is designated as connected to the distribution system pursuant to this subsection but does not commence commercial operation within two years following the date of the designation by the board.  

For all applications for designation as connected to the distribution system of a solar electric power generation facility filed with the board after the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et al.), the SREC term shall be 10 years.  

(a) The board shall determine an appropriate period of no less than 120 days following the end of an energy year prior to which a provider or supplier must demonstrate compliance for that energy year with the annual renewable portfolio standard;  

(b) No more than 24 months following the date of enactment of P.L.2012, c.24, the board shall complete a proceeding to investigate approaches to mitigate solar development volatility and prepare and submit, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14 -19.1), a report to the Legislature, detailing its findings and recommendations.  As part of the proceeding, the board shall evaluate other techniques used nationally and internationally;  

(c) The solar renewable portfolio standards requirements in this paragraph shall exempt those existing supply contracts which are effective prior to the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et al.) from any increase beyond the number of SRECs mandated by the solar renewable energy portfolio standards requirements that were in effect on the date that the providers executed their existing supply contracts.  This limited exemption for providers' existing supply contracts shall not be construed to lower the Statewide solar sourcing requirements set forth in this paragraph. Such incremental requirements that would have otherwise been imposed on exempt providers shall be distributed over the providers not subject to the existing supply contract exemption until such time as existing supply contracts expire and all providers are subject to the new requirement in a manner that is competitively neutral among all providers and suppliers.  Notwithstanding any rule or regulation to the contrary, the board shall recognize these new solar purchase obligations as a change required by operation of law and implement the provisions of this subsection in a manner so as to prevent any subsidies between suppliers and providers and to promote competition in the electricity supply industry.  

An electric power supplier or basic generation service provider may satisfy the requirements of this subsection by participating in a renewable energy trading program approved by the board in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, or compliance with the requirements of this subsection may be demonstrated to the board by suppliers or providers through the purchase of SRECs.  

The renewable energy portfolio standards adopted by the board pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall be effective as regulations immediately upon filing wit h the Office of Administrative Law and shall be effective for a period not to exceed 18 months, and may, thereafter, be amended, adopted or readopted by the board in accordance with the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act."  

The renewable energy portfolio standards adopted by the board pursuant to this paragraph shall be effective as regulations immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law and shall be effective for a period not to exceed 30 months after such filing, and shall, thereafter, be amended, adopted or readopted by the board in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act"; and  

(4) within 180 days after the date of enactment of P.L.2010, c.57 (C.48:3-87.1 et al.), that the board establish an offshore wind renewable energy certificate program to require that a percentage of the kilowatt hours sold in this State by each electric power supplier and each basic generation service provider be from offshore wind energy in order to support at least 3,500 megawatts of generation from qualified offshore wind projects.  

The percentage established by the board pursuant to this paragraph shall serve as an offset to the renewable energy portfolio standard established pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection and shall reduce the corresponding Class I renewable energy requirement.  

The percentage established by the board pursuant to this paragraph shall reflect the projected OREC production of each qualified offshore wind project, approved by the board pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2010, c.57 (C.48:3-87.1), for 20 years from the commercial operation start date of the qualified offshore wind project which production projection and OREC purchase requirement, once approved by the board, shall not be subject to reduction.  

An electric power supplier or basic generation service provider shall comply with the OREC program established pursuant to this paragraph through the purchase of offshore wind renewable energy certificates at a price and for the time period required by the board.  In the event there are insufficient offshore wind renewable energy certificates available, the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider shall pay an offshore wind alternative compliance payment established by the board.  Any offshore wind alternative compliance payments collected shall be refunded directly to the ratepayers by the electric public utilities.  

The rules established by the board pursuant to this paragraph shall be effective as regulations immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law and shall be effective for a period not to exceed 18 months, and may, thereafter, be amended, adopted or readopted by the board in accordance with the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).  

e. Notwithstanding any provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the board shall initiate a proceeding and shall adopt, after notice, provision of the opportunity for comment, and public hearing:  

(1) net metering standards for electric power suppliers and basic generation service providers.  The standards shall require electric power suppliers and basic generation service providers to offer net metering at non-discriminatory rates to industrial, large commercial, residential and small commercial customers, as those customers are classified or defined by the board, that generate electricity, on the customer's side of the meter, using a Class I renewable energy source, for the net amount of electricity supplied by the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider over an annualized period.  Systems of any sized capacity, as measured in watts, are eligible for net metering.  If the amount of electricity generated by the customer-generator, plus any kilowatt hour credits held over from the previous billing periods, exceeds the electricity supplied by the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider, then the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider, as the case may be, shall credit the customer-generator for the excess kilowatt hours until the end of the annualized period at which point the customer - generator will be compensated for any remaining credits or, if the customer-generator chooses, credit the customer-generator on a real-time basis, at the electric power supplier's or basic generation service provider's avoided cost of wholesale power or the PJM electric power pool's real-time locational marginal pricing rate, adjusted for losses, for the respective zone in the PJM electric power pool.  Alternatively, the customer-generator may execute a bilateral agreement with an electric power supplier or basic generation service provider for the sale and purchase of the customer-generator's excess generation. The customer-generator may be credited on a real-time basis, so long as the customer-generator follows applicable rules prescribed by the PJM electric power pool for its capacity requirements for the net amount of electricity supplied by the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider.  The board may authorize an electric power supplier or basic generation service provider to cease offering net metering to customers that are not already net metered whenever the total rated generating capacity owned and operated by net metering customergenerators Statewide equals 5.8 percent of the total annual kilowatt-hours sold in this State by each electric power supplier and each basic generation service provider during the prior one-year period;  

(2) safety and power quality interconnection standards for Class I renewable energy source systems used by a customer-generator that shall be eligible for net metering.  

Such standards or rules shall take into consideration the goals of the New Jers ey Energy Master Plan, applicable industry standards, and the standards of other states and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  The board shall allow electric public utilities to recover the costs of any new net meters, upgraded net meters, system reinforcements or upgrades, and interconnection costs through either their regulated rates or from the net metering customer-generator;  

(3) credit or other incentive rules for generators using Class I renewable energy generation systems that connect to New Jersey's electric public utilities' distribution system but who do not net meter; and  

(4) net metering aggregation standards to require electric public utilities to provide net metering aggregation to single electric public utility customers that operate a solar electric power generation system installed at one of the customer's facilities or on property owned by the customer, provided that any such customer is a State entity, school district, county, county agency, county authority, municipality, municipal agency, or municipal authority. The standards shall provide that, in order to qualify for net metering aggregation, the customer must operate a solar electric power generation system using a net metering billing account, which system is located on property owned by the customer, provided that: (a) the property is not land that has been actively devoted to agricultural or horticultural use and that is valued, assessed, and taxed pursuant to the "Farmland Assessment Act of 1964," P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.1 et seq.) at any time within the 10-year period prior to the effective date of  

P.L.2012, c.24, provided, however, that the municipal planning board of a municipality in which a solar electric power generation system is located may waive the requirement of this subparagraph (a), (b) the system is not an on-site generation facility, (c) all of the facilities of the single customer combined for the purpose of net metering aggregation are facilities owned or operated by the single customer and are located within its territorial jurisdiction except that all of the facilities of a State entity engaged in net metering aggregation shall be located within five miles of one another, and (d) all of those facilities are within the service territory of a single electric public utility and are all served by the same basic generation service provider or by the same electric power supplier.  The standards shall provide that in order to qualify for net metering aggregation, the customer's solar electric power generation system shall be sized so that its annual generation does not exceed the combined metered annual energy usage of the qualified customer facilities, and the qualified customer facilities shall all be in the same customer rate class under the applicable electric public utility tariff. For the customer's facility or property on which the solar electric generation system is installed, the electricity generated from the customer's solar electric generation system shall be accounted for pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection to provide that the electricity generated in excess of the electricity supplied by the electric power supplier or the basic generation service provider, as the case may be, for the customer's facility on whic h the solar electric generation system is installed, over the annualized period, is credited at the electric power supplier's or the basic generation service provider's avoided cost of wholesale power or the PJM electric power pool real-time locational marginal pricing rate.  All electricity used by the customer's qualified facilities, with the exception of the facility or property on which the solar electric power generation system is installed, shall be billed at the full retail rate pursuant to the electric public utility tariff applicable to the customer class of the customer using the electricity.  A customer may contract with a third party to operate a solar electric power generation system, for the purpose of net metering aggregation.  Any contractual relationship entered into for operation of a solar electric power generation system related to net metering aggregation shall include contractual protections that provide for adequate performance and provision for construction and operation for the term o f the contract, including any appropriate bonding or escrow requirements.  Any incremental cost to an electric public utility for net metering aggregation shall be fully and timely recovered in a manner to be determined by the board.  The board shall adopt net metering aggregation standards within 270 days after the effective date of P.L.2012, c.24.  

Such rules shall require the board or its designee to issue a credit or other incentive to those generators that do not use a net meter but otherwise generate electricity derived from a Class I renewable energy source and to issue an enhanced credit or other incentive, including, but not limited to, a solar renewable energy credit, to those generators that generate electricity derived from solar technologies.  

Such standards or rules shall be effective as regulations immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law and shall be effective for a period not to exceed 18 months, and may, thereafter, be amended, adopted or readopted by the board in accordance with the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act."  

f. The board may assess, by written order and after notice and opportunity for comment, a separate fee to cover the cost of implementing and overseeing an emission disclosure system or emission portfolio standard, which fee shall be assessed based on an electric power supplier's or basic generation service provider's share of the retail electricity supply market. The board shall not impose a fee for the cost of implementing and overseeing a greenhouse gas emissions portfolio standard adopted pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection c. of this section.  

g. The board shall adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), an electric energy efficiency  program in order to ensure investment in cost-effective energy efficiency measures, ensure universal access to energy efficiency measures, and serve the needs of low-income communities that shall require each electric public utility to implement energy efficiency measures that reduce electricity usage in the State  pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.9).  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent an electric public utility from meeting the requirements of this subsection by contracting with another entity for the performance of the requirements.  

h. The board shall adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), a gas energy efficiency program in order to ensure investment in cost-effective energy efficiency measures, ensure universal access to energy efficiency measures, and serve the needs of low-income communities that shall require each gas public utility to implement energy efficiency measures that reduce natural gas usage in the State pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.9).  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent a gas public utility from meeting the requirements of this subsection by contracting with another entity for the performance of the requirements.  

i. After the board establishes a schedule of solar kilowatt-hour sale or purchase requirements pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection d. of this section, the board may initiate subsequent proceedings and adopt, after appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment and public hearing, increased minimum solar kilowatt-hour sale or purchase requirements, provided that the board shall not reduce previously established minimum solar kilowatt-hour sale or purchase requirements, or otherwise impose constraints that reduce the requirements by any means.  

j. The board shall determine an appropriate level of solar alternative compliance payment, and permit each supplier or provider to submit an SACP to comply with the solar electric generation requirements of paragraph (3) of subsection d. of this section.  The value of the SACP for each Energy Year, for Energy Years 2014 through 2033 per megawatt hour from solar electric generation required pursuant to this section, shall be:  

EY 2014 $\$339$   
EY 2015 $\$331$   
EY 2016 $\$323$   
EY 2017 $\$315$   
EY 2018 $\$308$   
EY 2019 $\$268$   
EY 2020 \$258  
EY 2021 \$248  
EY 2022 \$238  
EY 2023 \$228  
EY 2024 \$218  
EY 2025 \$208  
EY 2026 \$198  
EY 2027 \$188  
EY 2028 \$178  
EY 2029 \$168  
EY 2030 \$158  
EY 2031 \$148  

EY 2032 $\$138$ EY 2033 $\$123$ .  

The board may initiate subsequent proceedings and adopt, after appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment and public hearing, an increase in solar alternative compliance payments, provided that the board shall not reduce previously establ ished levels of solar alternative compliance payments, nor shall the board provide relief from the obligation of payment of the SACP by the electric power suppliers or basic generation service providers in any form.  Any SACP payments collected shall be refunded directly to the ratepayers by the electric public utilities.  

k. The board may allow electric public utilities to offer long-term contracts through a competitive process, direct electric public utility investment and other means of financing, including but not limited to loans, for the purchase of SRECs and the resale of SRECs to suppliers or providers or others, provided that after such contracts have been approved by the board, the board's approvals shall not be modified by subsequent board orders.  If the board allows the offering of contracts pursuant to this subsection, the board may establish a process, after hearing, and opportunity for public comment, to provide that a designated segment of the contracts approved pursuant to this subsection shall be contracts involving solar electric power generation facility projects with a capacity of up to 250 kilowatts.  

l. The board shall implement its responsibilities under the provisions of this section in such a manner as to:  

(1) place greater reliance on competitive markets, with the explicit goal of encouraging   
and ensuring the emergence of new entrants that can foster innovations and price   
competition; (2) maintain adequate regulatory authority over non-competitive public utility services; (3) consider alternative forms of regulation in order to address changes in the technology   
and structure of electric public utilities; (4) promote energy efficiency and Class I renewable energy market development, taking   
into consideration environmental benefits and market barriers; (5) make energy services more affordable for low and moderate income customers; (6) attempt to transform the renewable energy market into one that can move forward   
without subsidies from the State or public utilities; (7) achieve the goals put forth under the renewable energy portfolio standards; (8) promote the lowest cost to ratepayers; and (9) allow all market segments to participate.  

m. The board shall ensure the availability of financial incentives under its jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, long-term contracts, loans, SRECs, or other financial support, to ensure market diversity, competition, and appropriate coverage across all ratepayer segments, including, but not limited to, residential, commercial, industrial, non-profit, farms, schools, and public entity customers.  

n. For projects which are owned, or directly invested in, by a public utility pursuant to section 13 of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.48:3-98.1), the board shall determine the number of SRECs with which such projects shall be credited; and in determining such number the board shall ensure that the market for SRECs does not detrimentally affect the development of non - utility solar projects and shall consider how its determination may impact the ratepayers.  

o. The board, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, electric public utilities, the Division of Rate Counsel in, but not of, the Department of the Treasury, affected members of the solar energy industry, and relevant stakeholders, shall periodically consider increasing the renewable energy portfolio standards beyond the minimum amounts  

set forth in subsection d. of this section, taking into account the cost impacts and public   
benefits of such increases including, but not limited to: (1) reductions in air pollution, water pollution, land disturbance, and greenhouse gas   
emissions; (2) reductions in peak demand for electricity and natural gas, and the overall impact on   
the costs to customers of electricity and natural gas; (3) increases in renewable energy development, manufacturing, investment, and job   
creation opportunities in this State; and (4) reductions in State and national dependence on the use of fossil fuels. p. Class I RECs and ORECs shall be eligible for use in renewable energy portfolio   
standards compliance in the energy year in which they are generated, and for the following   
two energy years.  SRECs shall be eligible for use in renewable energy portfolio standards   
compliance in the energy year in which they are generated, and for the following four energy   
years. q. (1) During the energy years of 2014, 2015, and 2016, a solar electric power generation   
facility project that is not: (a) net metered; (b) an on-site generation facility; (c) qualified for   
net metering aggregation; or (d) certified as being located on a brownfield, on an area of   
historic fill or on a properly closed sanitary landfill facility, as provided pursuant to   
subsection t. of this section may file an application with the board for approval of a   
designation pursuant to this subsection that the facility is connected to the distribution   
system.  An application filed pursuant to this subsection shall include a notice escrow of   
$\$40,000$ per megawatt of the proposed capacity of the facility.  The board shall approve the   
designation if: the facility has filed a notice in writing with the board applying for   
designation pursuant to this subsection, together with the notice escrow; and the capacity of   
the facility, when added to the capacity of other facilities that have been previously approved   
for designation prior to the facility's filing under this subsection, does not exceed 80   
megawatts in the aggregate for each year. The capacity of any one solar electric power   
supply project approved pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed 10 megawatts.  No more   
than 90 days after its receipt of a completed application for designation pursuant to this   
subsection, the board shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the application.   
The notice escrow shall be reimbursed to the facility in full upon either rejection by the   
board or the facility entering commercial operation, or shall be forfeited to the State if the   
facility is designated pursuant to this subsection but does not enter commercial operation   
pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection. (2) If the proposed solar electric power generation facility does not commence commercial operations within two years following the date of the designation by the board pursuant to this subsection, the designation of the facility shall be deemed to be null and void, and the facility shall not be considered connected to the distribution system thereafter. (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, a solar electric power generation facility project that as of May 31, 2017 was designated as "connected to the distribution system," but failed to commence commercial operations as of that date, shall maintain that designation if it commences commercial operations by May 31, 2018.   
r. (1) For all proposed solar electric power generation facility projects except for those solar electric power generation facility projects approved pursuant to subsection q. of this section, and for all projects proposed in energy year 2019 and energy year 2020, the board may approve projects for up to 50 megawatts annually in auctioned capacity in two auctions per year as long as the board is accepting applications.  If the board approves projects for less than 50 megawatts in energy year 2019 or less than 50 megawatts in energy year 2020, the  

difference in each year shall be carried over into the successive energy year until 100 megawatts of auctioned capacity has been approved by the board pursuant to this subsection. A proposed solar electric power generation facility that is neither net metered nor an on-site generation facility, may be considered "connected to the distribution system" only upon designation as such by the board, after notice to the public and opportunity for public comment or hearing.  A proposed solar power electric generation facility seeking board designation as "connected to the distribution system" shall submit an application to the board that includes for the proposed facility: the nameplate capacity; the estimated energy and number of SRECs to be produced and sold per year; the estimated annual rate impact on ratepayers; the estimated capacity of the generator as defined by PJM for sale in the PJM capacity market; the point of interconnection; the total project acreage and location; the current land use designation of the property; the type of solar technology to be used; and such other information as the board shall require.  

(2) The board shall approve the designation of the proposed solar power electric generation facility as "connected to the distribution system" if the board determines that: (a) the SRECs forecasted to be produced by the facility do not have a detrimental impact on the SREC market or on the appropriate development of solar power in the State; (b) the approval of the designation of the proposed facility would not significantly impact the preservation of open space in this State; (c) the impact of the designation on electric rates and economic development is beneficial; and (d) there will be no impingement on the ability of an electric public utility to maintain its property and equipment in such a condition as to enable it to provide safe, adequate, and proper service to each of its customers. (3) The board shall act within 90 days of its receipt of a completed application f or designation of a solar power electric generation facility as "connected to the distribution system," to either approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the application. If the proposed solar electric power generation facility does not commence commercial operations within two years following the date of the designation by the board pursuant to this subsection, the designation of the facility as "connected to the distribution system" shall be deemed to be null and void, and the facility shall thereafter be considered not "connected to the distribution system."

C.48:3-87.9  Public utility to reduce use of electricity, natural gas in territory.  

3. a. No later than one year after the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et al.), the Board of Public Utilities shall require each electric public utility and gas public utility to reduce the use of electricity, or natural gas, as appropriate, within its territory, by its customers, below what would have otherwise been used.  For the purposes of this section, a gas public utility shall reduce the use of natural gas for residential, commercial, and industrial uses, but shall not be required to include a reduction in natural gas used for distributed energy resources such as combined heat and power.  

Each electric public utility shall be required to achieve annual reductions in the use of electricity of two percent of the average annual usage in the prior three years within five years of implementation of its electric energy efficiency program.  Each natural gas public utility shall be required to achieve annual reductions in the use of natural gas of 0.75 percent of the average annual usage in the prior three years within five years of implementation of its gas energy efficiency program.  The amount of reduction mandated by the board that ex ceeds two percent of the average annual usage for electricity and 0.75 percent of the average annual usage for natural gas for the prior three years shall be determined pursuant to the study conducted pursuant to subsection b. of this section until the reduction in energy usage reaches the full economic, cost-effective potential in each service territory, as determined by the board.  

b. No later than one year after the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et al.), the board shall conduct and complete a study to determine the energy savings targets for full economic, cost-effective potential for electricity usage reduction and natural gas usage reduction as well as the potential for peak demand reduction by the customers of each electric public utility and gas public utility and the timeframe for achieving the reductions. The energy savings targets for each electric public utility and gas public utility shall be reviewed every three years to determine if the targets should be adjusted.  The board , in conducting the study, shall accept comments and suggestions from interested parties.  

c. No later than one year after the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et al.), the board shall adopt quantitative performance indicators pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) for each electric public utility and gas public utility, which shall establish reasonably achievable targets for energy usage reductions and peak demand reductions and take into account the public utility's energy efficiency measures and other non-utility energy efficiency measures including measures to support the development and implementation of building code changes, appliance efficiency standards, the Clean Energy program, any other State-sponsored energy efficiency or peak reduction programs, and public utility energy efficiency programs that exist on the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et al.).  In establishing quantitative performance indicators, the board shall use a methodology that incorporates weather, economic factors, customer growth, outage-adjusted efficiency factors, and any other appropriate factors to ensure that the public utility's incentives or penalties determined pursuant to subsection e. of this section and section 13 of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.48:3-98.1) are based upon performance, and take into account the growth in the use of electric vehicles, microgrids, and distributed energy resources.  In establishing quantitative performance indicators, the board shall also consider each public utility’s customer class mix and potential for adoption by each of those customer classes of energy efficiency programs offered by the public utility or that are otherwise available.  The board shall review each quantitative performance indicator every three years. A public utility may apply all energy savings attributable to programs available to its customers, including demand side management programs, other measures implemented by the public utility, non-utility programs, including those available under energy efficiency programs in existence on the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et al.), building codes, and other efficiency standards in effect, to achieve the targets established in this section.  

d. (1) Each electric public utility and gas public utility shall establish energy efficiency programs and peak demand reduction programs to be approved by the board no later than 30 days prior to the start of the energy year in order to comply with the requirements of this section.  The energy efficiency programs and peak demand reduction programs adopted by each public utility shall comply with quantitative performance indicators adopted by the board pursuant to subsection c. of this section.  

(2) The energy efficiency programs and peak demand reduction programs shall have a benefit-to-cost ratio greater than or equal to 1.0 at the portfolio level, considering both economic and environmental factors, and shall be subject to review during the stakeholder process established by the board pursuant to subsection f. of this section.  The methodology, assumptions, and data used to perform the benefit-to-cost analysis shall be based upon publicly available sources and shall be subject to stakeholder review and comment.  A program may have a benefit-to-cost ratio of less than 1.0 but may be appropriate to include within the portfolio if implementation of the program is in the public interest, including, but not limited to, benefitting low-income customers or promoting emerging energy efficiency technologies.  

(3) Each electric public utility and gas public utility shall file with the board implementation and reporting plans as well as evaluation, measurement, and verification strategies to determine the energy usage reductions and peak demand reductions achieved by the energy efficiency programs and peak demand reduction programs approved pursuant to this section.  The filings shall include details of expenditures made by the public utility and the resultant reduction in energy usage and peak demand.  The board shall determine the appropriate level of reasonable and prudent costs for each energy efficiency program and peak demand reduction program.  

e. (1) Each electric public utility and gas public utility shall file an annual petition with the board to demonstrate compliance with the energy efficiency and peak demand reduction programs, compliance with the targets established pursuant to the quantitative performanc e indicators, and for cost recovery of the programs, including any performance incentives or penalties, pursuant to section 13 of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.48:3-98.1).  Each electric public utility and gas public utility shall file annually with the board a petition to recover on a full and current basis through a surcharge all reasonable and prudent costs incurred as a result of energy efficiency programs and peak demand reduction programs required pursuant to this section, including but not limited to recovery of and on capital investment, and the revenue impact of sales losses resulting from implementation of the energy efficiency and peak demand reduction schedules, which shall be determined by the board pursuant to section 13 of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.48:3-98.1).  

(2) If an electric public utility or gas public utility achieves the performance targets established in the quantitative performance indicators, the public utility shall receive an incentive as determined by the board through an accounting mechanism established pursuant to section 13 of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.48:3-98.1) for its energy efficiency measures and peak demand reduction measures for the following year.  The incentive shall scale in a linear fashion to a maximum established by the board that reflects the extra value of achieving greater savings.  

(3) If an electric public utility or gas public utility fails to achieve the reductions in its performance target established in the quantitative performance indicators, the public utility shall be assessed a penalty as determined by the board through an accounting mechanism established pursuant to section 13 of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.48:3-98.1) for its energy efficiency measures and peak demand reduction measures for the following year.  The penalty shall scale in a linear fashion to a maximum established by the board that reflects the extent of the failure to achieve the required savings.  

(4) The adjustments made pursuant to this subsection may be made through adjustments of the electric public utility's or gas public utility's return on equity related to the energy efficiency or peak demand reduction programs only, or a specified dollar amount, reflecting the incentive structure as established in this subsection.  The adjustments shall not be included in a revenue or cost in any base rate filing and shall be adopted by the board pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act."  

f. (1) The board shall establish a stakeholder process to evaluate the economically achievable energy efficiency and peak demand reduction requirements, rate adjustments, quantitative performance indicators, and the process for evaluating, measuring, and verifying energy usage reductions and peak demand reductions by the public utilities.  As part of the stakeholder process, the board shall establish an independent advisory group to study the evaluation, measurement, and verification process for energy efficiency and peak demand reduction programs, which shall include representatives from the public utilities, the Division of Rate Counsel, and environmental and consumer organizations, to provide recommendations to the board for improvements to the programs.  

(2) Each electric public utility and gas public utility shall conduct a demographic analysis as part of the stakeholder process to determine if all of its customers are able to participate fully in implementing energy efficiency measures, to identify market barriers that prevent such participation, and to make recommendations for measures to overcome such barriers. The public utility shall be entitled to full and timely recovery of the costs associated with this analysis.  

g. For the purposes of this section, the board shall only consider usage for which public utility energy efficiency programs are applicable.

7. Section 6 of P.L.2010, c.57 (C.34:1B-209.4) is amended to read as follows:  

C.34:1B-209.4  Credit to business for wind energy facility; eligibility.  

6. a. (1) A business, upon application to and approval from the authority, shall be allowed a credit of 100 percent of its capital investment, made after the effective date of P.L.2010, c.57 (C.48:3-87.1 et al.) but prior to its submission of documentation pursuant to subsection c. of this section, in a qualified wind energy facility located within an eligible wind energy zone, pursuant to the restrictions and requirements of this section.  To be eligible for any tax credits authorized under this section, a business shall demonstrate to the authority, at the time of application, that the State's financial support of the proposed capital investment in a qualified wind energy facility will yield a net positive benefit to the State.  The value of all credits approved by the authority pursuant to this section may be up to $\$100,000,000$ , except as may be increased by the authority if the chief executive officer of the authority judges certain qualified offshore wind projects to be meritorious.  Credits provided pursuant to this section shall not be applicable to the cap on the credits provided in section 3 of P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-209).  

(2) (a) A business, other than a tenant eligible pursuant to subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, shall make or acquire capital investments totaling not less than $\$50,000,000$ in a qualified wind energy facility, at which the business, including tenants at the qualified wind energy facility, shall employ at least 300 new, full-time employees, to be eligible for a credit under this section.  A business that acquires a qualified wind energy facility aft er the effective date of P.L.2010, c.57 (C.48:3-87.1 et al.) shall also be deemed to have acquired the capital investment made or acquired by the seller.  

(b) A business that is a tenant in the qualified wind energy facility, the owner of which has made or acquired capital investments in the facility totaling more than $\$50,000,000$ , shall occupy a leased area of the qualified wind energy facility that represents at least $\$17,500,000$ of the capital investment in the qualified wind energy facility at which at least $300~\mathrm{new}$ , fulltime employees in the aggregate are employed, to be eligible for a credit under this section. The amount of capital investment in a facility that a leased area represents shall be equal to that percentage of the owner's total capital investment in the facility that the percentage of net leasable area leased by the tenant is of the total net leasable area of the qualified business facility.  Capital investments made by a tenant shall be deemed to be included in the calculation of the capital investment made or acquired by the owner, but only to the extent necessary to meet the owner's minimum capital investment of $\$50,000,000$ .  Capital investments made by a tenant and not allocated to meet the owner's minimum capital investment threshold of $\$50,000,000$ shall be added to the amount of capital investment represented by the tenant's leased area in the qualified wind energy facility.  

(c) The calculation of the number of new, full-time employees required pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph may include the number of new, full-time positions resulting from an equipment supply coordination agreement with equipment manufacturers, suppliers, installers and operators associated with the supply chain required to support the qualified wind energy facility.  

For the purposes of this paragraph, "full time employee" shall not include an employee who is a resident of another state and whose income is not subject to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., unless that state has entered into a reciprocity agreement with the State of New Jersey, provided that any employee whose work is provided pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement with a business in the wind energy zone may be included.  

(3) A business shall not be allowed a tax credit pursuant to this section if the business receives a business employment incentive grant pursuant to the “Business Employment Incentive Program Act,” P.L.1996, c.26 (C.34:1B-124 et al.), relating to the same capital and employees that qualify the business for this credit, or if the business receives assistance pursuant to the "Business Retention and Relocation Assistance Act," P.L.1996, c.25 (C.34:1B-112 et seq.).  A business that is allowed a tax credit under this section shall not be eligible for incentives authorized pursuant to the "Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Recovery Act," P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.).  

(4) Full-time employment for an accounting or privilege period shall be determined as the average of the monthly full-time employment for the period. b. A business shall apply for the credit by July 1, 2024, and a business shall submit its documentation for approval of its credit amount by July 1, 2027. c. The credit allowed pursuant to this section shall be administered in accordance with the provisions of subsection c. of section 3 of P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-209) and section 33 of P.L.2009, c.90 (C.34:1B-209.1), except that all references therein to "qualified business facility" shall be deemed to refer to "qualified wind energy facility," as that term is defined in subsection f. of this section.  

d. The amount of the credit allowed pursuant to this section shall, except as otherwise provided, be equal to the capital investment made by the business, or the capital investment represented by the business’s leased area, and shall be taken over a 10-year period, at the rate of one-tenth of the total amount of the business’s credit for each tax accounting or privilege period of the business, beginning with the tax period in which the business is first approved by the authority as having met the investment capital and employment qualifications, subject to any disqualification as determined by annual review by the authority.  In conducting its annual review, the authority may require a business to submit any information determined by the authority to be necessary and relevant to its review.  The credit amount for any tax period ending after the date 18 years after the effective date of P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) during which the documentation of a business’s credit amount remains unapproved shall be forfeited, although credit amounts for the remainder of the years of the 10 -year credit period shall remain available.  The amount of the credit allowed for a tax period to a business that is a tenant in a qualified wind energy facility shall not exceed the business’s total lease payments for occupancy of the qualified wind energy facility for the tax period.  

e. The authority shall adopt rules and regulations pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) as are necessary to implement this section, including, but not limited to: examples of and the determination of capital investment; the nature of businesses and employment positions constituting and participating in an equipment supply coordination agreement; a determination of the types of businesses that may be eligible and expenses that may constitute capital improvements; the promulgation of procedures and forms necessary to apply for a credit; and provisions for applicants to be charged an initial application fee, and ongoing service fees, to cover the administrative costs related to the credit.  

The rules and regulations established by the authority pursuant to this subsection shall be effective immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law and shall be effective for a period not to exceed 12 months and may, thereafter, be amended, adopted or readopted in accordance with the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).
