# EV Charging Initiatives  

# Funding for Public EV Charging Stations  

Efficiency Maine periodically releases funding opportunities for the installation of EV charging stations at commercial and public properties. Visit our Opportunities page to view current funding opportunities. Federal tax credits are also available to offset the cost of eligible EV charging projects.  

# Maine's Plan for EV Infrastructure Deployment  

In November 2021, the U.S. Congress enacted the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (lJA), including the $\$7.5$ billion National lectric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVl) program to build a national network of EV chargers. In order to receive Maine's allocation of approximately $\$19$ million in NEVI funds, state agencies developed a Plan for Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment outlining how the state plans to use NEVI and other funding sources to expand public EV charging over the next five years. Eficiency Maine, MaineDOT, and other state agencies developed this plan with input from stakeholders. Click here for a progress report.  

# Past EV Charging Initiatives  

# Phase I: Level 3/DC Fast Chargers (VW Settlement)  

Efficiency Maine funded the installation of 14 DC Fast Chargers and seven dual plug Level 2 chargers at seven different sites along a number of travel corridors. These chargers are located on the Maine Turnpike at the Kennebunk plazas (northbound and southbound) and the West Gardiner plaza, as well as in Jackman, Skowhegan, Farmington, and North Windham. Additional higher-power DC Fast Charging ports were added to the Maine Turnpike sites in summer 2022.
