 ## Summary : 
 **_Note: Proposals are due October 4, 2024. The Clean Energy Center has not
yet determined whether all the federal funds it received will be distributed
this round, and future funding rounds may be available._**

Massachusetts Clean Energy Center released an RFP for grid operators, storage
operators, distribution providers, among other entities, to enhance the
resiliency of the electric grid. Eligible projects include the use or
construction of DERs for enhancing resiliency during disruptive grid events,
including microgrids and battery storage subcomponents. The awards vary, and
cost matching is required.

Energy storage systems, including batteries, are allowed if the system is used
to improve grid resilience during disruptive events. Co-located storage
systems may be allowed, and any equipment integrated a battery into a solar
system is likely an allowable expense
