 ## Summary : 
 **_Note:[The Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf#page=993)
created the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/) with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

Oregon's [NEVI
Plan](https://www.oregon.gov/odot/climate/Documents/Oregon%20NEVI%20EV%20State%20Plan.pdf)
was developed jointly by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) and
the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE). ODOT's deployment strategy is expected
to evolve throughout the five-year program, building off of lessons learned.
ODOT plans to partner with the private sector, rather than owning and
maintaining the EV charging stations. In June 2023, ODOT opened the
solicitation process for the Year One NEVI projects, requesting statements of
qualification for EV infrastructure work In September 2023, the state received
approval of its [updated state
plan](https://www.oregon.gov/odot/climate/Documents/Final%20for%20Submission_Oregon%20DOT%20FY%202024%20NEVI%20State%20Plan.pdf).
In June 2024, NOFOs were issued for Round 1 NEVI work on [Interstate
