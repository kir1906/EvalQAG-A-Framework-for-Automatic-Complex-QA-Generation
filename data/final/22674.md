The City of Boston Environment Department has updated the BERDO Emissions Factors List (August 2024) which now includes accounting for the emissions benefits of the Massachusetts Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPs) for Electric Grid energy use. The Factors List includes projected ISO New England electric grid emissions, the Massachusetts RPS, and related calculation formula.  

Beginning January 1, 2025, all projects must use the updated BERDO Emissions Factors List for Article 37 Reporting. The updated 2035 Electric Grid Emissions Factor is $97.9~\mathrm{kg}\mathrm{~/~MWh~}$ ,oOr $28.7\mathrm{kg}$ / MBtu of CO2e. Please use these emissions factors for calculating and reporting Building 2035 predicted Carbon Emission Intensity  

# ARTICLE 37 GREEN BUILDINGS&CLIMATE RESILIENCY  

Boston Zoning Code Article 37, Green Buildings (Article 37) and the Climate Resiliency Review Policy (Resiliency Policy) ensure that major building projects are planned, designed, constructed, and managed to minimize adverse environmental impacts; conserve natural resources; are resilient to climate change; promote a more sustainable city; and enhance the quality of life in Boston.  

In support of the City's resiliency and carbon emissions reduction goals, including Carbon Neutral Boston 2050, projects are required to prepare a carbon neutral building assessment and include Zero Net Carbon strategies in their projects. Please review the Carbon Neutral Building Assessment and A37 Review Procedures and Submittal Requirements documents below for additional details.  

Please utilize the Developer Portal to complete the updated Climate Resiliency Checklist, the Sea Level Rise - Flood Hazarc Area mapping tool, and Coastal Flood Resilience Design Guidelines in preparing Article 37 project filings.  

All proposed projects subject to or electing to comply with Zoning Article 80B, Large Project Review are subject to the requirements of Zoning Article 37 and the Resiliency Policy.
