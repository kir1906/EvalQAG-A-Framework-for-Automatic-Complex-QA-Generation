 ## Summary : 
 This is a financial incentive program for residential customers. Customers
receive financial incentive for enrolling their qualifying EV charger and
allowing us to optimize the schedule of their EV’s charging each day to help
manage the load on the electric grid. In addition to the optimized charging
schedule, we may adjust customers charging during up to 10 demand response
events during the year. There is a $25 one-time incentive for enrolling the
charger and a $5 monthly incentive for participating.
