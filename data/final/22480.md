# Competitive Solar Incentive (CSI) Program  

The Competitive Solar Incentive (CSI) Program is an annual competitive procurement that provides incentives to qualifying grid supply solar generation projects (i.e., those selling into wholesale markets), grid supply solar generation paired with energy storage, and to large non-residential net metered projects with a capacity greater than 5 MWdc.  The annual solicitation target is 300 MW of new solar generation, and 160 MWh of energy storage paired with solar generation.  

To qualify for the CSI Program, projects submit a pre-qualification application to provide evidence that the project meets maturity requirements and specific tranche eligibility criteria; pre-qualification applications undergo administrative review by the solicitation manager. Eligible CSI projects then submit a bid for an SREC-II award in an appropriate market tranche, specified in dollars per MWh of solar electricity production; pre-qualified projects compete on bid price only.  CSI-eligible projects may bid for SREC-IIs in five market tranches:  1) Tranche 1, basic grid supply projects; 2) Tranche 2, grid supply projects sited on the built environment; 3) Tranche 3, grid supply projects sited on contaminated sites and landfills; 4) Tranche 4, net metered non-residential projects greater than five (5) MW; and 5) Tranche 5, energy storage paired with a grid supply project eligible for Tranche 1, 2 or 3.  

Rules for the CSI Program are codified at N.J.A.C. 14:8-11 as part of the larger Successor Solar Incentive (SuSI) Program.  

# Solicitation Information  

The Board anticipates announcing the opening of the third CSI Program solicitation at an upcoming agenda, with the solicitation window opening to prequalification applications shortly thereafter. You are encouraged to monitor the Board’s website to review each agenda as it is posted.

Incentive awards made through the CSI Program are intended to reflect current market conditions and provide a long-term, guaranteed incentive structure for developer investment.  At the same time, the competitive solicitation process was specifically established to ensure that the state incentivizes the projects that seek the lowest incentive contribution from the ratepayers.  To ensure that the cost of the SREC-II awards represent the lowest cost to New Jersey’s ratepayers, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (Board) may set confidential, pre-determined price caps for any or all tranches prior to opening the solicitation.  

# CSI Program Registration  

After the Board announces awards by Board Order for a solicitation, the CSI online registration portal will be opened.  Only new CSI projects that have been awarded a bid by Board Order, pursuant to N.J.A.C. 14:8-11.10 will be permitted to register, and will have 30 days following the announcement of the award to register their CSI-eligible solar facility through the registration portal.  

Registrants must submit an Initial Registration package with all required documents through the CSI Registration Online Portal.  The CSI Initial Registration package must include all the documents listed on the CSI Initial Registration Checklist which can be found on the CSI registration portal homepage.  

Further information on CSI Program registration, including requirements and forms, can be found below.

The Solar Act of 2021 directed the Board to establish siting criteria for all CSI-eligible facilities, defined at N.J.A.C. 14:8-1.2 as “all grid supply solar facilities and net metered solar facilities over 5 MW as measured in direct current (MWdc), connected to a distribution or transmission system operated by a New Jersey electric distribution company.” The Board requires that all solar facilities, whether or not their owner/operators opt to seek incentives through the CSI Program, be required to register their respective solar projects with the CSI Program registration manager so that the Board is able to track and monitor all solar facilities subject to New Jersey’s solar siting rules.  

Siting Rules for Grid Supply and Large Net Metered Solar Facilities are published to the New Jersey Register at N.J.A.C. 14:8-12.  These rules apply to all solar installations that would be eligible to compete in the Competitive Solar Incentive (CSI) Program.  

CSI-eligible facilities are prohibited from siting on the following land use types, as listed at N.J.A.C. 14:8-12.3:

CSI-eligible facilities are not allowed to register with the Board and pursue development if the cumulative solar development on covered agricultural lands, as defined at N.J.A.C. 14:8-12.2, exceeds $2.5\%$ of such lands Statewide.  Following the second CSI solicitation, this limit is 8,085 acres.   CSI-eligible facilities are also not allowed to pursue development in any county if the cumulative solar development on covered agricultural lands in that county exceeds a $5\%$ threshold.  The acreages of the county-by-county $5\%$ development limit are available at csisolar.nj.gov.  The Board will not consider waivers for proposed solar facilities that exceed the $5\%$ county concentration limit within a given county.  Facilities approved as dual-use agrivoltaics facilities will not count towards cumulative solar development acreage.  

Pursuant to construction requirements found at N.J.A.C. 14:8-12.8, CSI-eligible facilities must comply with the NJ Department of Environmental Protection’s Standards for the Use of Pollinator-Friendly Native Plant Species and Seed Mixes in Grid Supply and Select Net Metered Solar Facilities. Facilities sited on the built environment or on a contaminated site or landfill are exempted from compliance with these standards.  

All CSI-eligible facilities, other than those located on the built environment, must comply with the requirements for soil erosion and sediment control in accordance with the N.J. Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act (N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.) and implementing Rules at N.J.A.C. 2:90-1.0 et seq.

# Instructions on CSI Requirements for Decreases and Increases to the Solar System  

The CSI Program allows solar systems to be increased in size by up to $20\%$ or 25 kW (dc), whichever is smaller, from the original system size proposed in the initial CSI Registration package.  

Net metered solar facilities cannot decrease the system capacity by any amount that would reduce the project below 5 MW (dc). Grid solar facilities can decrease in size from the capacity conditionally certified via Board Order, with no restrictions.  

Registrants are required to submit a request to the CSI processing team for any increase to the system size that was proposed with the CSI Initial Registration package. The below CSI System Change Form must be emailed to NJREINFO@NJCleanEnergy.com to request a change to the size of the solar facility.  

CSI Request Form to Increase System Size  

# Extenstion Policy  

Solar facilities conditionally accepted in the CSI Program may be eligible for one 6-month extension. The registrant may apply for an extension for any solar installation that cannot complete the installation and submit a complete Final As-Built (Post Construction Certification) Packet with permission to operate from the Electric Distribution Company in the CSI online registration portal by the expiration date noted in the CSI Acceptance Letter.  

CSI Extension Request Checklist  

Extension Requests will be reviewed and considered on a case-by-case basis and should include supporting documentation of extenuating circumstances for the delay in completing the facility, evidence that the facility has made progress towards completion, and demonstrations of the likelihood of timely and successful completion of the solar facility. For all solar facilities, the CSI Program Manager will consider whether the registrant has submitted timely quarterly milestone reporting forms. If the extension is granted, the CSI Program will provide a new registration expiration date six months from the expiration on the original conditional CSI Acceptance Letter.  

Any CSI solar facility that would like to submit a request for a second extension must submit a petition to the NJBPU for consideration.
