 ## Summary : 
 Duke Energy's PowerPair program provides financial incentives to customers who
install solar photovoltaic (PV) plus storage systems at their homes. All
participants will receive an upfront incentive based on the size of their PV
and battery systems, up to a maximum of $9,000.

Participants must enroll in either Duke Energy's [Solar Choice Tariff or
Bridge Rate](https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/1246/net-
metering). Both options are functionally similar to net metering; however, the
Solar Choice Tariff requires customers to be on a Time-of-Use rate, while the
Bridge Rate allows customers to be on non-time-varying rates. Customers who
participate via the Bridge Rate, however, must also grant control of the
battery system to Duke and participate in its [EnergyWise/Power Manager
Battery Control Program](https://www.duke-energy.com/home/products/energywise-
home/battery-control). The [Battery Control Program](https://www.duke-
energy.com/home/products/power-manager/battery-control) also provides monthly
bill credits based on their system's make and model.

Incentives will initially be awarded through a random selection process (RSP).
The RSP window will be four weeks in length, from May 10, 2024 to June 7,
2024. Applications can be submitted at any time within the RSP window.
Incentive reservation or waitlist placement will be communicated by June 20.
On June 21 enrollment will resume on a first-come, first-served basis.
