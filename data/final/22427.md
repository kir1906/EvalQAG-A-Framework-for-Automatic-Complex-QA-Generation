Insulation or EV Ready Equipment:  

A basic minimum requirement for insulation:   
An insulating increase of R-10 or greater to an external feature (wall, ceiling, etc.) where the installation occurs.   
A basic minimum requirement for EV Ready Equipment:   
40 amp, 208 to 240 volt dedicated branch circuit for servicing electric vehicles that terminates in a suitable termination point, such as a receptacle or junction box, and is located in reasonably close proximity to the proposed location of the parking spaces.  

2. Determine if, the applicant, is a low-income individual or the home or building is serving as affordable housing. If so, the project may be eligible for a larger tax credit. To qualify, the owner or occupants of the building must have an annual household adjusted gross income that is equal to or less than two hundred percent of (2 times) the federal poverty level guidelines. For federal poverty level guidelines published by the United States department of health and human services. Go to: https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines/ These values change annually so please verify eligibility based on the most current year. For 2021 the values were:

Air Leakage for Sliding Doors ≤ 0.3 cfm/ft? Air Leakage for Swinging Doors ≤ 0.5 cfm/ft?  

3. Determine if the building where the energy conserving product installation took place is a residential building or commercial building as defined in the 2021 Sustainable Building Tax Credit statute.  

In summary, a Residential building is a building used as a single-family residence (e.g. a detached single-family home) and a Commercial building is any other building.
