# Efficient Financing for Building Efficiency  

# What is PACE Financing?  

PACE is a simple and effective way to finance energy efficiency and renewable energy building improvements. PACE can pay for qualifying improvements for almost any type of property including commercial, retail, industrial, nonprofit, and multi-family.  

Property owners across the United States are using PACE because it saves them money and makes their buildings more valuable. PACE provides financing for $100\%$ of an energy project’s cost and is repaid for up to 30 years with a voluntary special assessment added to the property’s tax bill.  

# Why PACE Financing?  

# No Down Payment  

PACE covers $100\%$ of the hard and soft costs of an energy project eliminating the need for up-front capital.  

# No Personal Guarantee  

PACE financing is “guaranteed” by the Special Assessment added to the property’s tax bill, therefore, no personal or business guarantees are needed.  

# Off Balance Sheet Treatment  

Because PACE financing is solely repaid via a Special Assessment added to the property’s tax bill, “off balance sheet treatment” is recommended by some accountants because the repayment “runs with the land” and not the business.  

# Fixed Rate/Fixed Payment  

PACE financing rates and terms are fixed for the life of the PACE loan.  

# Up to 30 Year Term  

Repayment terms can be extended to match the useful life of the eligible improvement.  

# Triple Net Lease Pass-through  

Because repayment of PACE funding is via a Special Assessment on the property’s tax bill and is technically an increase in property taxes, the property owner can seamlessly share the PACE-financed improvement costs (and energy savings) with the tenant under some lease structures such as “triple nets”.

# Initial Eligibility Form  

The property owner completes a brief form at TNPACE.org to help determine if the property and potential energy project is eligible for PACE financing. If desired, TENNESSEE PACE can provide the information to its network of PACE capital providers to obtain PACE financing terms for the owner.  

# Energy Project Summary Form  

The property owner works with a qualified contractor to identify eligible improvements and quantify the savings. This form is submitted with the Energy Project Application.  

# Energy Project Application  

The application allows the property owner to provide essential financial documentation about the property and its operating status.  

NOTE: The property owner must obtain written consent from the existing mortgage holder before a PACE special assessment can be added to the property’s tax bill.  

# Funding  

The property owner agrees to financing terms and then, after local government approval, the PACE special assessment is added to the property’s tax bill. After the PACE financial closing occurs, the funding will be available for the eligible energy saving improvements.  

# 5 Installation  

The contractor of record completes the installation of the authorized improvements.
