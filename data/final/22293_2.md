# With a PPA from the Green Bank you can:  

“Go solar” without any upfront costs or incurring any debt.   
Lock in low electricity costs and realize predictable energy production over the standard 20-year agreement term.   
See positive cash flow in year one.   
Let your customers, employees, residents, competitors, and community see that you’re making a positive impact on the environment by harnessing the power of the sun.   
Rest easy knowing that you don’t need to maintain the system or manage equipment and warranty issues.   
Have the option of purchasing the system at fair market value in the future.   
Transfer the PPA to a new building owner if you sell the property, possibly increasing the sales price of your building.
