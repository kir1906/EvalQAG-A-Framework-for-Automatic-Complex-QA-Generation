enacted in May 2023 (see section 216C.377), created the Solar Grant Program:
Public Buildings program under the Minnesota Department of Commerce.  
  
The Program allows local government units to apply for grants for up to 100%

local government units and assess the applications and ensure that all costs
are necessary and reasonable. The amount of the grant amount awarded must be

government unit.  
  
The program provides grants for systems the smaller of (a) up to 40 kW or (b)
up to 120% of the building's annual average electric consumption.
