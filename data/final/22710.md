# Clean Energy Benefits and Cost Savings for All New Yorkers  

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 represents the single largest investment in climate and energy in U.S. history, directing billions of dollars towards homeowners, renters, businesses, municipalities, and nonprofit organizations to lower the cost of clean energy technologies. Over the next decade, the IRA promises to grow New York's clean energy economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet the goals of the Climate Act .  

The IRA offers rebates, tax credits, and low-cost financing to make the switch from fossil-fueled appliances and equipment to new, clean electric models. New Yorkers can often combine these IRA benefits with State incentives and programs to maximize savings on electric vehicles, solar panels, energy efficiency upgrades, heat pumps, and more.  

Since 2023, IRA tax credits have been available to all New Yorkers. New York State is in the process of rolling out IRA rebates, with initial funding available for income-eligible New Yorkers through the EmPower+ Program and Appliance Upgrade Program. Additional IRA rebates, including offers for multifamily buildings, willbecome available in 2025.
