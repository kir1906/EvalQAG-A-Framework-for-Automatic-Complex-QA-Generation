# LED LIGHTINGREBATE PROGRAM  

Commercial and Industrial members who upgrade their light bulbs to more energyefficient bulbs that meet the co-op’s standards will be eligible for “per unit” rebates. The rebate is based on how many watts, or units of energy, are saved with the new bulbs. For each watt saved, EnergyUnited will provide the member a rebate of $\$0.10$ . It may seem small but those cents add up. Replacing 20 465-watt bulbs with 20 high-bay fluorescent 221-watt bulbs would save 4,880 watts. That’s a total of \$488.00!
