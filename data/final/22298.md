# Charging speeds  

There are three levels of charging speeds:  

Level 1 chargers come with every EV and plug into a standard 120-volt wall outlet. They provide 4 miles of range per hour, or 32 miles of range overnight. This pace can serve those who do not require faster refueling.  

Level 2 chargers are common because they support charge rates of roughly 25 miles of range per hour. They require the installation of a 240-volt outlet by a qualified electrician and provide flexibility due to their faster charging speed.  

DC fast chargers are most often located along well-traveled public thruways and can provide up to $80\%$ of a vehicle’s charging need in 30 minutes.  

# Finding public charging  

It’s easy to find a public charger, download the PlugShare app and it tells you where the nearest DC fast or Level 2 charging station is to your location.
