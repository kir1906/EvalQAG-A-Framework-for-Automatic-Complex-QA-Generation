 ## Summary : 
 **_Note:[The Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf#page=993)
created the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/) with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) is the designated lead
agency for NEVI, and is partnering with the California Energy Commission
(CEC). California's initial [NEVI
Plan](https://efiling.energy.ca.gov/GetDocument.aspx?tn=244314&DocumentContentId=78373)
was submitted to the federal Joint Office of Energy and Transportation on
August 1, 2022, and its [2023 Update](https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-
media/programs/esta/documents/nevi/2023-ca-nevi-plan-update-final-a11y.pdf)
was submitted on August 1, 2023.

California plans to use the estimated $134 million in formula funding from the
first two years to provide connectivity for passenger vehicles in a manner
that is complimentary to existing investments from the state. In future annual
deployment plans, California will reassess proposed uses of NEVI funds,
including infrastructure that primarily serves light or medium- and heavy-duty
vehicles, within the requirements of the NEVI program and in the context of
Californiaâ€™s overall funding and deployment strategy.

The CEC released the [first
solicitation](https://www.energy.ca.gov/solicitations/2023-10/gfo-23-601-californias-
national-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-formula) in late-October 2023, and
accepted applications through January 26, 2024. The top-six corridor groups
are eligible during the first solicitation, with a total of $40,500,000
divided between the corridor groups.
