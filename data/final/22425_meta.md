 ## Summary : 
 H.B 2234, enacted in April 2021, created a 3Â¢/kWh tax on electric vehicle
charging at public, for-profit charging stations. The tax will go into action
on January 1, 2024. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2023,
electric vehicle owners can apply for a tax credit against these charges. The
maximum amount of credit is equal to the registration fees for the electric
vehicle(s) paid during the same tax year: $100 for fully electric vehicles and
$30 for hybrid vehicles. If a taxpayer's tax liability is less than the amount
of credit due, the excess credit may be carried forward for up to 5 years.
