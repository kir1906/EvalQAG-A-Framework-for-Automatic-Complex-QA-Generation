With a Solar Roof Lease, your commercial building or nonprofit roof’s unused space becomes a revenueproducer. Leasing your roof space to the Green Bank to install a solar PV system means a reliable, worry-free tenant who puts lease payments in your account. And your roof helps put more renewable energy into the utility grid leading to a healthier future for all. If your roof isn’t suitable for solar, you can also consider leasing a portion of your unused land (ground mount solar) or combine solar with a carport in your parking lot.

# Key features  

Earn fixed payments, which could be thousands of dollars annually depending on the size of your roof.   
Enjoy solar without the stress and worries of system ownership. The Green Bank owns the system and as responsible for performance and maintenance.   
“Go solar” without any upfront costs, incurring any debt, or no financial underwriting. The review process is quicker and simpler than with other solar options. Excellent solar option for building owners who are credit challenged, have limited equity in their property, or who cannot monetize tax credits.   
Let your customers, employers and competitors see that you’re making a positive impact on the environment by harnessing the power of the sun.   
Make improvements to your roof as part of the installation process.   
Transfer the lease to a new building owner if you sell the property. An income generating roof can improve the property value at the time of sale.
