 ## Summary : 
 Connecticut enacted legislation in 2019 ([H.B.
7156](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2019/act/pa/pdf/2019PA-00071-R00HB-07156-PA.pdf))
authorizing the procurement of 2,000 MW of offshore wind by December 31, 2030.
The law specifically authorizes the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental
Protection, in consultation with the Office of Consumer Counsel and the
Attorney General, to solicit proposals for energy derived from offshore wind
facilities that are Class I renewable energy sources and any associated
transmission. Any such solicitation may be in coordination with other states
in the control area of the regional independent system operator, in
coordination with states in a neighboring control area, or on behalf of
Connecticut alone. The statutes provide further guidance regarding the timing
and the nature of the solicitation(s).
