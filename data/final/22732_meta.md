 ## Summary : 
 Denver is working towards a zero-emission future by 2040. Natural gas
combustion accounted for nearly 22% of Denverâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions in
2022 and increased 5% since 2018. Zero-emission ground-source, water-source,
and multi-source thermal energy systems are needed as sustainable alternatives
to fossil-gas based heating systems in Denver. Due to up-front costs, the
adoption of such thermal energy systems has proven to be limited.

The Office of Climate Action, Sustainability and Resiliency (CASR) intends to
meet Denver's decarbonization goals by offering a monetary incentive to
support scoping studies, detailed design studies, implementation projects, or
a combination of these options for eligible thermal energy systems. The
eligible thermal energy options included in the program, applicant types, and
the levels of incentives offered by will be updated regularly as market
conditions change.
