All-electric requirements for new buildings begin on January 1, 2023. An all-electric building is a building that does not have fuel gas piping installed on the lot or within the building; and that uses electricity as the sole source of energy except for emergency power systems that are required to serve essential facilities or are otherwise required by law or regulation.  

# Effective Dates for All-Electric Requirements:  

• January 1, 2023, for new buildings 1-3 stories January 1, 2026, for new buildings 4 stories or more  

Complete building permit applications (including payment of all required fees) filed with and accepted by the City’s Building Division prior to the effective dates will not be subject to all-electric requirements.  

Since the New Building Electrification Ordinance was first adopted on June 1, 2021, the Community Development Department has encouraged applicants to plan for all-electric compliance beginning with initial early design.  Solutions include but are not limited to:  Designing projects to create space for electric infrastructure and equipment; utilizing energy efficiency to reduce electrical loads; and consulting with SMUD to address electric infrastructure issues by contacting SMUD’s electrical design process team as early as possible by following this link:  https://www.smud.org/en/Business-Solutions-and-Rebates/Design-andConstruction-Services/New-SMUD-Construction-Required.  

Applicability:  The New Building Electrification Ordinance applies to construction of all new buildings, with the exception of renovations to existing buildings, additions to existing buildings, and tenant improvements.  

Limited exemptions:  For building permit applications filed on or before December 31, 2025, an applicant may request one of the following limited exemptions to construct a mixed fuel building.  

Ground floor food service establishment for the area of the building with cooking equipment. The building official shall grant the exemption only for fuel gas piping, fixtures, or infrastructure necessary for cooking equipment within the designated food service area. Manufacturing or industrial facilities for the area of the building with process loads. The building official shall grant this exemption only for the area of the building with process loads. Water‐heating systems and equipment in regulated affordable housing for those portions of the building where virtual net energy metering is not available.  

# Infeasibility Waivers  

If an applicant believes that all-electric options have been exhausted, and an all-electric building is infeasible because of the type of building, physical site conditions, commercial availability of electric appliances or equipment, necessary operational requirements, electrical infrastructure requirements, or the public health, safety, or economic welfare in the event of an electric grid outage, the applicant may submit an application and supporting documentation for an Infeasibility Waiver.  Applicants are encouraged to refer to guidelines for infeasibility waivers:  Infeasibility Waiver Guidance Document.  

The application and supporting documentation should be submitted to the Building Division prior to formal building permit application/plan check.  The Building Division will engage the services of a qualified technical consultant to conduct a review.  The Building Division will make a determination whether to approve or deny the waiver.  

The Building Official may waive all-electric requirements only for those portions of the building if a building permit applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the building official that it is infeasible to comply with the requirements because of the type of building, physical site conditions, commercial availability of electric appliances or equipment, necessary operational requirements, electrical infrastructure requirements, or the public health, safety, or economic welfare in the event of an electric grid outage.
