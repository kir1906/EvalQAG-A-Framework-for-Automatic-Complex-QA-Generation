created the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/) with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

Under the [Missouri Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment
Plan](https://www.modot.org/sites/default/files/documents/NEVI%20Plan%20update%202023_Revised_Sept2023Final.pdf),
Missouri plans to release a Request for Proposals for NEVI funding at some
