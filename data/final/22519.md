# Section 1.  Information and Instructions  

# 1.1 Title and Purpose  

Title: New Hampshire Clean Diesel Grant Program: Request for Proposals  

Purpose: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) Program, through state-run programs, funds projects that protect human health and improve air quality by reducing harmful emissions from diesel engines. Through the New Hampshire Clean Diesel Grant Program, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) seeks proposals for eligible diesel emission reduction projects utilizing New Hampshire’s federal DERA funding for federal fiscal years (FFY) 2023-24.  

# 1.2 Background  

Despite today’s cleaner vehicles and fuels, millions of 2009 and older diesel vehicles and engines in use across the United States continue to emit large amounts of oxides of nitrogen $(\mathsf{N O}_{\mathsf{x}})$ , particulate matter (PM), and air toxics that contribute to serious public health problems including asthma, lung cancer, and various other cardiac and respiratory diseases that can cause lung damage and even premature death. Replacing or retrofitting older diesel equipment will reduce emissions of these pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide $\left(\mathsf{C O}_{2}\right)$ .  

Although future funding is not guaranteed, NHDES has been awarded DERA funding from EPA on an annual basis and has made those funds available through a competitive grant program. Since 2015, NHDES has awarded over approximately $\$2,750,000$ for eligible projects. Completed projects will result in emissions reductions of approximately 260 tons of ${\mathsf{N O}}_{\mathsf{x}},$ 9.3 tons of PM, and 10,000 tons of ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ over the lifetime of the projects.  

# 1.3 Available Funding, Restrictions and Reimbursement  

NHDES has approximately $\$500,000$ available for diesel emissions reduction project awards.  

NHDES plans to administer two rounds of funding. Please see Section 1.5 Program Schedule for details. Proposals will be evaluated and scored competitively (see Section 3 for evaluation details) and qualifying projects meeting minimum requirements will be eligible for funding. If more proposals are received than can be funded, NHDES will prioritize funding higher scoring projects. NHDES reserves the right to negotiate grant agreements and to offer partial funding for projects.  

# Projects that are already in process or completed are not eligible under this program.  

Project costs incurred prior to approval of a grant agreement by the New Hampshire Governor and Executive Council shall not be eligible for reimbursement by NHDES. A grantee shall not use funds awarded under the program to cover expenses incurred prior to the project period set forth in the grant agreement. However, at NHDES’ sole discretion and if good cause exists, NHDES may reimburse a grantee reasonable Project costs incurred prior to the New Hampshire Governor and Executive Council approval of the grant agreement.  

This program is a reimbursement program only. Approved grantees may request reimbursement for eligible project expenses as agreed in their approved grant agreement. Participants must provide nonfederal matching funds for all projects.  

No funds awarded under this program shall be used to fund the cost of emissions reductions that are mandated under federal law. This restriction applies when the mandate takes effect (the effective date) for any affected vehicles, engines, or equipment.  

This Request for Proposals (RFP), as well as the associated Appendix B: EPA’s DERA State Grants Program Guide, which can be found on the NHDES website’s NH Clean Diesel Grant Program webpage, detail certain eligibility requirements. After ensuring your project meets the comprehensive project eligibility requirements, please submit your proposal to the Designated Contact email address below.

# 1.16 Certified Remanufacture Systems (Locomotive Projects):  

Funding can cover up to $100\%$ of the cost (including labor) of certain locomotive engine upgrades. Some engines can be upgraded through the application of a certified remanufacture system (i.e. kit). Generally, a certified remanufacture system is applied during an engine rebuild and involves the removal of parts on an engine and replacement with parts that cause the engine to represent an engine configuration which is cleaner than the original engine.  

Engine remanufacture systems may not be available for all engines, and not all remanufacture systems may achieve an emissions benefit. Applications for certified remanufacture systems should include a discussion of the availability of engine remanufacture systems and indicate the pre- and post-project emission standard of the engines to demonstrate that the upgrade will result in a PM and/or ${\mathsf{N O}}_{\mathsf{x}}$  

emissions benefit. If a certified remanufacture system is applied at the time of an engine rebuild, funds under this award cannot be used for the entire cost of the engine rebuild, but only for the cost of the certified remanufacture system and associated labor costs for installation of the kit.  

To be eligible for funding, remanufacture systems for locomotives must be certified by EPA at the time of acquisition. A list of certified remanufacture systems is available on the EPA website.  

# 1.17 Other Projects  

Other projects, such as aerodynamic technology retrofits, the use of verified low rolling resistance tires and other diesel engine remanufactures may be eligible as well. For more information, please visit the NH Clean Diesel Grant Program webpage and reference the 2023-24 NHDES DERA Work Plan, Vehicles and Technologies section beginning on page 4.
