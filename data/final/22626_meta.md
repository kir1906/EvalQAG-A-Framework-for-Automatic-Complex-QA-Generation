 ## Summary : 
 Alabama does not have statewide interconnection standards.

Southern Company, the parent company of Alabama Power Company, does have a
[policy](https://www.alabamapower.com/content/dam/alabama-power/pdfs-
docs/SOCO%20Interconnection%20Policy.pdf) on operation of distributed energy
resources (DER) in parallel with the distribution system.  

The policy does not give explicit information on system size limits in
relation to levels of review. The scope of any required system impact study is
determined jointly by the DER owner and the utility. Following the system
impact study, an interconnection equipment study may also be required.
Incorporation of energy storage systems may require additional study.
