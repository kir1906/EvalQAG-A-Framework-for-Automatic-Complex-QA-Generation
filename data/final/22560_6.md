Indicated equipment eligible for quality installation bonus when installed by an approved quality installation contractor and installation information is included in the Vendor/Contractor Information on Page 8.  

\*\*For the purpose of this incentive a dual-fuel system pairs an electric heat pump (primary heat source) with a natural gas, propane, or fuel oil furnace and alternates between the two fuel sources to maximize comfort and efficiency. At the discretion of the Utility, electric thermal storage heating systems may also be considered if capable of maintaining temperatures during controlled periods.
