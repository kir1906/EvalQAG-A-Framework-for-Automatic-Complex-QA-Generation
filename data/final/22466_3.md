# RCW 82.16.183  Community solar projects. (Expires June 30, 2038.)  

(1) Beginning July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2033, an administrator of a community solar project meeting the eligibility requirements described in this section and RCW 82.16.170(3) may submit an application to the Washington State University extension energy program to receive a precertification for a community solar project. Projects with precertification applications approved by the Washington State University extension energy program have two years to complete their projects and apply for certification. Projects that have not completed certification within two years may apply to the Washington State University extension energy program for an extension of their precertification status for an additional 180 days if they can demonstrate significant progress during the time they were in precertification status. By certifying qualified projects pursuant to the requirements of this section and RCW 82.16.170(3), the Washington State University extension energy program authorizes the utility serving the site of a community solar project in the state of Washington to remit a one-time low-income community solar incentive payment to the community solar project administrator, who accepts the payment on behalf of, and for the purpose of providing direct benefits to, the project's qualifying subscribers.  

(2) A one-time low-income community solar incentive payment remitted to a community solar project administrator for a project certified under this section equals the sum of the following:  

(a) An amount, not to exceed \$20,000 per community solar project, equal to the community solar project's administrative costs related to the administrative start-up of the project for qualifying subscribers; and  

(b) An amount that does not exceed 100 percent of the proportional cost of the installed cost of the share of the community solar project that provides direct benefits to qualifying subscribers, taking into account any federal tax credits or other federal or nonfederal grants or incentives that the program is benefiting from. (3) No new certification may be issued under this section for a community solar project that was certified under RCW 82.16.120 or 82.16.165, or for a community solar project served by a utility that has elected not to participate in the incentive program provided in this section.  

(4) Community solar projects that are under precertification status under RCW 82.16.165 as of June 30, 2020, may not apply for precertification of that same project for the one-time low-income community solar incentive payment provided in this section.  

(5)(a) In addition to the one-time low-income community solar incentive payment under subsection (2) of this section, a participating utility must also provide the following compensation for the generation of electricity from the certified project:  

(i) For a community solar project that has an alternating current nameplate capacity no greater than 100 kilowatts, and that is connected behind the electric service meter, compensation must be determined in accordance with RCW 80.60.020 and provided to the retail electric customer receiving service at the situs of the meter.  

(ii) For all other community solar projects for which the administrator is not a utility, compensation paid to the interconnection customer must be determined in a written agreement between the interconnection customer and the utility.  

(iii) For all other community solar projects for which the administrator is a utility, compensation must be provided directly to subscribers in accordance with subsection (8)(a)(i) of this section. (iv)(A) When the administrator of a community solar project receives compensation for the generation of electricity from a participating utility, interconnection customer, or from the retail electric customer that is the host for the community solar project, the administrator must provide all of that compensation as a direct benefit to the project subscribers, except as described in (iv)(B) of this subsection.  

(B) An administrator may deduct ongoing administrative and maintenance costs from compensation they provide to subscribers from power generation, provided those costs are identified in the subscription agreement or justified to the Washington State University extension energy program. The Washington State University extension energy program shall review any such administrative and maintenance costs justifications for reasonableness and approve, reject, or negotiate changes to the proposal. An administrator may request a change in the deduction for administrative and maintenance costs to the Washington State University extension energy program only if the subscription agreement includes language notifying the subscriber that administrative and maintenance fees are subject to change.  

(b) For 10 years after certification, and by March 1st of each year following certification, the administrator must provide the Washington State University extension energy program with signed statements of the following for the preceding year:  

(i) The energy production for the period for which compensation is to be provided;  

(ii) Each subscriber's units of the project; (iii) The amount disbursed to each subscriber for the period; and (iv) The date and amount disbursed to each subscriber.  

(6) A utility's participation in the incentive program provided in this section is voluntary.  

(a) The utility may terminate its voluntary participation in the program by providing notice in writing to the Washington State University extension energy program to cease accepting new applications for precertification for community solar projects that would be served by that utility. Such notice of termination of participation is effective after 15 days, at which point the Washington State University extension energy program may not accept new applications for precertification for community solar projects that would be served by that utility.  

(b) Upon receiving a utility's notice of termination of participation in the incentive program, the Washington State University extension energy program must report on its website that community solar project customers of that utility are no longer eligible to receive new certifications under the program.  

(c) A utility that has terminated participation in the program may resume participation upon filing a notice with the Washington State University extension energy program.  

(7)(a) The Washington State University extension energy program may issue certifications authorizing incentive payments under this section in a total statewide amount not to exceed \$100,000,000, and subject to the following biennial dollar limits:  

(i) For fiscal year 2023, \$300,000; and (ii) For each biennium beginning on or after July 1, 2023, \$25,000,000.  

(b) The Washington State University extension energy program must attempt to equitably distribute incentive funds throughout the state. Considerations for equitable fund distribution, based on precertification applications received from administrators served by utilities voluntarily participating in the program, may include measures to reserve or allocate available funds based on the proportion of public utility taxes collected, the proportion of the state's low-income customers served by each utility based on lowincome home energy assistance program data at the department of commerce, measures to achieve an equitable geographic distribution of community solar installations and a diversity of administrative models for community solar projects, and the amount of energy burden reduction for qualifying subscribers relative to the project's cost. If an equitable distribution of funds is not feasible due to a lack of precertification applications, the Washington State University extension energy program may allocate funds based on (a) of this subsection on a first-come, first-served basis.  

(c) The Washington State University extension energy program must ensure that at least \$2,000,000 of the statewide total for the entire program is used to support nonprofit organizations' innovative approaches to allocating benefits to subscribers, defining and valuing benefits to be provided to subscribers or other aspects of the subscriber, administrator, system host, and utility relationship.  

(d) The Washington State University extension energy program must also ensure that at least \$2,000,000 of the statewide total for the entire program is available to tribal governments and their designated subdivisions and agencies.  

(e) The Washington State University extension energy program shall regularly publish and update guidelines for how it manages the allocation of available funding, based on the evaluation of applications and the factors specified in (b) of this subsection.  

(f) Beginning in fiscal year 2026, the Washington State University extension energy program may waive the requirements in (c) or (d) of this subsection if it fails to receive applications that meet the criteria of (c) or (d) of this subsection sufficient to result in the full allocation of incentives.  

(8)(a) Prior to obtaining certification under this section, the administrator of a community solar project must apply for precertification against the funds available for incentive payments under subsection (7) of this section in order to be guaranteed an incentive payment under this section. The application for precertification must include, at a minimum:  

(i) A demonstration of how the project will deliver continuing direct benefits to low-income subscribers. A direct benefit can include credit for the power generation for the community solar project or other mechanisms that lower the energy burden of a lowincome subscriber; and  

(ii) Any other information the Washington State University extension energy program deems necessary in determining eligibility for precertification.  

(b) The administrator of a community solar project must complete an application for certification in accordance with the requirements of subsection (9) of this section within less than two years of being approved for precertification status. The administrator must submit a project update to the Washington State University extension energy program after one year in precertification status.  

(9) To obtain certification for the one-time community solar incentive payment provided under this section, a project administrator must submit to the Washington State University extension energy program an application, including, at a minimum:  

(a) A signed statement that the applicant has not previously received a notice of eligibility from the department under RCW 82.16.120 or the Washington State University extension energy program under RCW 82.16.165 entitling the applicant to receive annual incentive payments for electricity generated by the community solar project at the same meter location;  

(b) A signed statement of the costs paid by the administrator related to administering the project for qualifying subscribers; (c) A signed statement of the total project costs, including the proportional cost of the share of the community solar project that provides direct benefits to qualifying subscribers;  

(d) A signed statement describing the amount of the upfront incentive and the timing, method, and distribution of estimated benefits to qualifying subscribers. The statement must describe any estimated energy burden reduction associated with the direct benefits; (e) Available system operation data, such as global positioning system coordinates, tilt, estimated shading, and azimuth;  

(f) Any other information the Washington State University extension energy program deems necessary in determining eligibility and incentive levels or administering the program;  

(g)(i) Except as provided in (g)(ii) of this subsection (9), the date that the community solar project received its final electrical inspection from the applicable local jurisdiction, as well as a copy of the permit or, if the permit is available online, the permit number or other documentation deemed acceptable by the Washington State University extension energy program;  

(ii) The Washington State University extension energy program may waive the requirement in (g)(i) of this subsection (9), accepting an application and granting provisional certification prior to proof of final electrical inspection. Provisional certification expires 180 days after issuance, unless the applicant submits proof of the final electrical inspection from the applicable local jurisdiction or the Washington State University extension energy program extends certification, for a term or terms of 30 days, due to extenuating circumstances;  

(h) Confirmation of the number of qualifying subscribers; (i) A copy of the executed agreement describing how benefits will be determined and distributed from the retail electric customer or interconnection customer to the administrator if the administrator and the retail electric customer or interconnection customer are not the same. The Washington State University extension energy program must review the executed agreement to determine that benefits are being fairly determined and that there is an adequate plan for distributing the benefits; and  

(j) Any other information the Washington State University extension energy program deems necessary in determining eligibility and incentive levels or administering the program.  

(10) No incentive payments may be authorized or accrued until the final electrical inspection and executed interconnection agreement are submitted to the Washington State University extension energy program. (11)(a) The Washington State University extension energy program must review each project for which an application for certification is submitted in accordance with subsection (8) of this section for  

reasonable cost and financial structure, with a targeted installed cost for the solar energy system of $\$2$ per watt direct current for systems over 200 kilowatts and \$2.25 per watt direct current for systems equal to or under 200 kilowatts. For solar energy systems that include storage systems, the targeted installed cost of the storage system is $\$600$ per kilowatt-hour of storage capacity.  

(b) The Washington State University extension energy program may approve an application for a project that costs more or less than the targeted installed costs under (a) of this subsection based on a review of the project, documents submitted by the project applicant, and available data. Project cost evaluations may include costs associated with energy storage systems and electrical system improvements to permit grid-independent operation. Applicants may petition the Washington State University extension energy program to approve a higher cost per watt or per kilowatt-hour for unusual circumstances.  

(c) The Washington State University extension energy program may review the cost per watt target under (a) of this subsection prior to each fiscal biennium and is authorized to determine a new cost per watt target.  

(12)(a) Within 30 days of receipt of an application for certification, the Washington State University extension energy program must notify the applicant and, except when a utility is the applicant, the utility serving the site of the community solar project, by mail or electronically, whether certification has been granted. The certification notice must state the total dollar amount of the low-income community solar incentive payment for which the applicant is eligible under this section.  

(b) Within 60 days of receipt of a notification under (a) of this subsection, the utility serving the site of the community solar project must remit the applicable one-time low-income community solar incentive payment to the project administrator, who accepts the payment on behalf of, and for the purpose of providing direct benefits to, the project's qualifying subscribers.  

(13)(a) Certification follows the community solar project if the following conditions are met using procedures established by the Washington State University extension energy program:  

(i) The community solar project is transferred to a new owner who notifies the Washington State University extension energy program of the transfer;  

(ii) The new owner provides an executed interconnection agreement with the utility serving the site of the community solar project; and (iii) The new owner agrees to provide equivalent ongoing benefits to qualifying subscribers as the current owner.  

(b) In the event that a qualifying subscriber terminates their participation in a community solar project during the first 120 months after project certification, the system certification follows the project and participation must be transferred to a new qualifying subscriber.  

(14) Beginning January 1, 2023, the Washington State University extension energy program must post on its website and update at least monthly a report, by utility, of:  

(a) The number of certifications issued for community solar projects; and  

(b) An estimate of the amount of credit that has not yet been allocated for low-income community solar incentive payments and that remains available for new community solar project certifications in the state.  

(15) Persons receiving incentive payments under this section must   
keep and preserve, for a period of five years for the duration of the   
consumer contract, suitable records as may be necessary to determine   
the amount of incentive payments applied for and received. (16) The nonpower attributes of the community solar project must   
be retired on behalf of the subscribers unless, in the case of a   
utility-owned community solar project, a contract between the   
subscriber that benefits the subscriber clearly states that the   
attributes will be retained and retired by the utility. (17) All lists, technical specifications, determinations, and   
guidelines developed under this section must be made publicly   
available online by the Washington State University extension energy   
program. (18) The Washington State University extension energy program   
may, through a public process, develop program requirements, policies,   
and processes necessary for the administration or implementation of   
this section. (19) Applications, certifications, requests for incentive   
payments under this section, and the information contained therein are   
not deemed tax information under RCW 82.32.330 and are subject to   
disclosure. (20) No certification may be issued under this section by the   
Washington State University extension energy program for a community   
solar project after June 30, 2035. (21) Community solar projects certified under this section must   
be sited on preferred sites to protect natural and working lands as   
determined by the Washington State University extension energy   
program. (22) This section expires June 30, 2038.  [2022 c 212 s 5.]  

Findings—Intent—2022 c 212: "The legislature finds and declares that stimulating local investment in community solar projects continues to be an important part of a state energy strategy by helping to increase energy independence from fossil fuels, promote economic development, hedge against the effects of climate change, and attain environmental benefits. The legislature finds that although previous community solar programs were successful in stimulating these benefits, the programs failed to provide an adequate framework for low-income participation and long-term market certainty. The legislature finds that the vast majority of Washingtonians still do not have access to the benefits of solar energy. The legislature intends to stimulate the deployment of community solar projects for the benefit of all Washingtonians by funding the renewable energy production incentive program for community solar projects and by creating opportunities for broader participation, especially by lowincome households and low-income service providers. As of December 2021, the state is 10.3 megawatts short of the 115 megawatts of solar photovoltaic capacity established as a goal under RCW 82.16.155. The legislature therefore intends to provide an incentive sufficient to promote installation of community solar projects through June 30, 2033, at which point the legislature expects to review the effectiveness of enhancing access to community solar projects."
