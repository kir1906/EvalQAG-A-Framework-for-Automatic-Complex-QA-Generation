 ## Summary : 
 WeCare for Apartment Building Owners is an education and weatherization
program designed to reduce energy consumption for property owners with income-
eligible tenants. This could include installing LED bulbs, thermostats, energy
efficient water devices, and occasionally insulation and duct sealing.

Eligibility:

1\. The customer must have a minimum of one month of service with LG&E or KU
with an account for common area space within the property.

2\. The building must have a minimum of 4 units.

3\. At least 50% of the tenants within the property must be receiving
assistance from at least one of the federal or state income-based programs
that are based on income levels at or below 200% of the federal income levels
as determined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

4\. A property owner may not request these WeCare services more than once in a
three-year period.

5\. The property owner is responsible for providing proper notice to each of
the tenants regarding access to the occupied space for audit and potential
energy efficient upgrades.
