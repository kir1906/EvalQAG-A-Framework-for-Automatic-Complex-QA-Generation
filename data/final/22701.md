The City of Ashland offers a wide variety of incentives to allow citizens to make energy efficient and environmentally friendly home improvements.  

Make sure to sign up for a home energy review for any of the weatherization or heating/cooling incentives.

# Home Energy Review  

Begin with an on-site home energy review from our Residential Energy Analyst to help identify ways to reduce your energy use or get more out of the energy you use currently. The energy review may lead to simple immediate actions to improve the efficiency and control of your home or it could identify more significant actions to consider.  

All weatherization and heating/cooling incentives require a City of Ashland utility home energy review to determine program eligibility and incentive amounts.  

To sign up for a home energy review for any of the weatherization or heating/cooling incentives, use this form or contact climate@ashland.or.us / 541-488-5306

# Heating & Cooling  

The average home uses half of their annual energy cost on heating and cooling. Replacing your old system with a highly efficient heat pump may be the answer to lowering your bill while adding comfort.  

If you are looking for something quiet, easy to use, and energy-efficient, ductless heat pumps provide heating at a fraction of the cost of electric baseboard and wall heaters. They also provide cooling to keep your home comfortable year-round.  

A home energy review is required prior to incentive offerings.

# HEAT PUMP WATER HEATER  

# Heat Pump Water Heater  

Would you like to cut your water heating energy costs by up to $60\%?$ Upgrade to a heat pump water heater, which is 2-3 times as efficient as a standard electric water heater. Heat pump water heaters work in reverse of a refrigerator. Refrigerators remove heat from an enclosed box and expel heat. A heat pump water heater takes the heat from the surrounding air and transfers it to water in an enclosed tank.

Dependent on the number of people in your household, ENERGY STAR certified heat pump water heaters consume less kilowatts per hour, which can help save you money on your utility bill.  

# Current Incentive  

The City offers a $\$600$ incentive for installing a Tier III or higher unit that is listed on the City of Ashland Qualified Product List. The incentive is valid for an existing electric or gas water heater.

# INDUCTION COOKTOP/RANGE

# Induction Cooktop/Range Incentive  

Induction cooktops heat pots and pans directly through an electromagnetic field. The magnetic field strikes the iron molecules in your cookware, producing heat. This heat is only transferred between the coil and the pan, allowing induction cooking to be faster, more precise, and more efficient. From a safety standpoint, there is no open flame or indoor air pollution that is generated from combustion.  

do a magnet test to the bottom of your pan. If purchasing new kitchenware, check to make sure it is compatible with induction cooktops.  

# Do I need special cookware?  

You will need cooking pans that contain iron. This is needed to activate the electromagnetic field that generates heat. Copper, aluminum, and glass will not work. If you are unsure,  

# Are they noisy?  

There is a faint humming sound that comes the energy transfer.  

How is induction cooking better for indoor air quality? Induction cooking does not produce combustion gases.  

# Are induction cooktops more efficient?  

Yes! Due to the direct transfer of heat, there is less energy wasted. Various studies have found anywhere from $75{-}90\%$ of the heat generated is used for cooking. In comparison, when cooking with gas, only around $30–40\%$ of the heat generated is used for cooking.  

# Do induction cooktops affect pacemakers?  

Due to the electromagnetic field, there can be interference with a pacemaker. Consult your doctor.

# Current Incentives  

These incentives are for permanent installations of an induction cooktop or range (no portable units). A cooktop is the standalone burners that go on your counter. A range has both an oven and a cooktop in one appliance.  

Cooktops must be entirely induction.   
Ranges must have a cooktop that is entirely induction with an electric oven.   
The appliance cannot be dual fuel.

# WEATHERIZATION  

# Weatherization  

Weatherization programs are designed to safely keep your home as warm or cool as you desire and minimize air leaks. This is primarily done through high efficiency windows and insulation. Because these programs are designed to improve the energy efficiency of electric utility customers, only homes heated with electric heat sources are eligible for weatherization incentives.
