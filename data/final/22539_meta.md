 ## Summary : 
 _Note: The federal government has imposed and updated appliance efficiency
standards through several legislative acts,* and now has standards in place or
under development for 30 classes of products. In general, states which had set
standards prior to federal action may enforce their own standards until the
federal standards take effect. States that had not set standards prior to
federal action must use the federal standards. This summary addresses (1)
state appliance standards that will be in place until the federal standards
take effect and (2) products for which the federal government is not currently
developing an efficiency standard. Much of the information in this summary
comes from the Appliance Standards Awareness Project
([ASAP](https://appliance-standards.org/)).Visit the ASAP web site and the
U.S. Department of Energy's [Appliance and Equipment
Standards](https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/appliance-and-equipment-
standards-program) site for comprehensive information about appliance
standards._
