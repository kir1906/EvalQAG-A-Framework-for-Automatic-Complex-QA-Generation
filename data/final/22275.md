# Additional Rebate Resources  

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) announced that it will transition its existing Clean Vehicle Rebate Project (CVRP) program to a new program that helps low- and middle-income Californians access zero-emissions.  

In late 2023, a new program will expand statewide access to the existing Clean Cars 4 All program that gives residents up to $\$12,000$ to scrap and replace older, polluting cars with cleaner alternatives, or will offer additional assistance through up to $\$7,500$ in vehicle purchase grants for car buyers not scrapping an older vehicle, in addition to affordable financing options. The existing CVRP program will continue to accept applications while funding remains available. Once funding has been exhausted, the program will close to new applications, and updated information will be available on the CVRP website.  

Anaheim Public Utilities does not administer this program. Please reach out to CARB for questions.
