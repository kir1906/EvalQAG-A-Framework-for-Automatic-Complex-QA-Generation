Ix. SUBSCRIPTION CREDITS  

A. Subscriber Organizations are required to provide real time reporting of production as specified by the Utility. For CSG Facilities greater than $250\mathrm{kW}$ the Subscriber Organization shall provide real time electronic access to production data. The Utility may require different real time reporting for CSG Facilities 250 kW and smaller.   
B. The Subscriber Organization for each CSG Facility will provide a monthly report to the Utility listing all Subscribers and the proportion of the CSG Facility Output that shall be applied to each Subscriber's monthly electric bill. The monthly report shall follow a standard format specified by the Utility in order to integrate data into the Utility's billing system. The monthly report shall also include the amount of the CSG Facility's capacity that remains unsubscribed.   
C. The Utility shall apply credits to each Subscriber's monthly bill using the most recently updated monthly Subscriber list and Output data on a two-month lag where actual operational results and the associated bill credit will show up two months following the Utility's receipt of Output data for the CSG Facility.   
D. The Utility shall determine the amount of CSG Facility monthly kWh Output to be credited to each Subscriber by multiplying the Subscriber's most recent generation proportion of the CSG Facility by the Utility metered Output of the CSGFacility.  

E. The CSG per kWh credit will be based on avoided capacity and energy costs for Subscribers that do not qualify as a Low-Income Subscriber. The value of the CSG per kWh credit will be determined by the following:  

1. The CSG per kWh credit shall be the sum of the avoided energy costs and corresponding avoided capacity costs;  

2. The avoided energy cost, expressed in $\$1\mathrm{kWh}$ will be the weighted average of the previous calendar year's hourly locational marginal prices ("LMPs") applicable to the Utility. The hourly LMPs shall be weighted based on the estimated hourly output of a $1\mathrm{kW_{DC}}$ solar PV installation in New Orleans as calculated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's PVWatts Calculator for a standard fixed array system with a tilt and orientation typical for New Orleans;  

3. 。 The corresponding avoided capacity cost, will be expressed in $\$1\mathrm{kWh}$ and based on the MISO Cost of New Entry (\*CONE") value for the planning year that corresponds to the month in which the credit is provided and shall be calculated as follows: avoided capacity $\mathrm{cost}=(\mathrm{CV}^{*}0.5)/\mathrm{AEE}$ where:  

· CV is equal to the CONE value in $\$1\mathrm{kW}$ -yr for MISO Local Resource Zone 9 for the planning year that corresponds with the month in which the credit is provided; 0.5 represents the adjustment used by MISO for solar resources in determining the initial Resource Adequacy value for the purposes of the Planning Resource Auction ("PRA"); AEE is equal to the annual estimated energy in kWh from a 1 kWpc solar PV installation in New Orleans as calculated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's PVWatts Calculator for a standard fixed array system with an tilt and orientation typical for New Orleans.  

F.The appropriate credit to be applied to the bill of each Subscriber that does not qualify as a Low-Income Subscriber will be a dollar amount credit determined by multiplying the Subscriber's kWhs from Section VII1.D. by the value of each CSG per k Wh credit from Section VII1.E.
