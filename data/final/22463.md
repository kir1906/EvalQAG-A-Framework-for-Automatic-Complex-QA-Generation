# More Oregonians can now go solar  

The Oregon Community Solar Program expands access to solar energy. Oregon residents, businesses, nonprofits and government entities can all sign up. It doesn’t matter whether you rent or own your home or building, and it doesn’t matter what kind of home you live in. If you have a utility account with Portland General Electric, Pacific Power or Idaho Power, you are eligible to subscribe to a community solar project.  

# Discounts for people with low incomes  

One of the goals of the Oregon Community Solar Program is to expand solar access for people with low incomes. If you meet income guidelines, you could qualify for discounted rates, no up-front costs and other benefits and protections when you subscribe to a community solar project.  

# How does community solar work?  

•	You will receive a credit for your portion of the solar energy generated at your project and pay a subscription fee on your monthly utility bill.   
•	Most subscribers will also save on their bill thanks to the solar generation. In other words, the credit covers the subscription fee and can save on annual electricity costs.   
•	If you meet low-income guidelines, you will receive special benefits and protections including no upfront costs, no termination fees, subscription discounts and guaranteed savings on your energy bill.   
•	The monthly charge and solar savings amounts vary by project, subscription type, subscription size and your electricity usage.
