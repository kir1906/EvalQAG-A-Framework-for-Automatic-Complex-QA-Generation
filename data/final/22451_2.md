# DECISION  

# I. INTRODUCTION  

# A. SUMMARY  

In this Decision, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (Authority or PURA) approves updates to the Non-Residential Renewable Energy Solutions Program (NRES Program or Program), administered by The Connecticut Light and Power Company d/b/a Eversource Energy (Eversource) and The United Illuminating Company (UI; collectively, with Eversource, electric distribution companies or EDCs).  The approved changes are intended to better align the NRES Program with the program objectives.  The Decision also sets the NRES price caps and bid preferences for project applications received in calendar year 2024.  

# B. BACKGROUND OF THE PROCEEDING  

On June 30, 2021, the Authority established a combined successor program to the state’s Low and Zero Emissions Renewable Energy Credit (LREC/ZREC) and Virtual Net Metering (VNM) programs for non-residential customers, termed the NRES Program. Decision, June 30, 2021, Docket No. 20-07-01, PURA Implementation of Section 3 of Public Act 19-35, Renewable Energy Tariffs and Procurement Plans (Non-Residential Tariff Decision).  Pursuant to Section III.K. of the Non-Residential Tariff Decision, the Authority initiates an annual docket to review key Program metrics with stakeholders and to evaluate whether and how the Program should be modified to more fully accomplish the objectives established in the Non-Residential Tariff Decision.  This proceeding serves as the administrative record for the Authority’s review and approval of the Year 3 NRES Program Manual and other key compliance filings.  

The Authority conducted the first annual NRES Program review in Docket No. 21- 08-03, Annual Non-Residential Renewable Energy Tariff Program Review – Year 1, issuing a Decision on November 3, 2021 (Year 1 Decision).  The Year 1 Decision finalized the Year 1 Program Manual and set NRES Program price caps for project bids received in calendar year 2022.  

The Authority conducted the second annual NRES Program review in Docket No. 22-08-03, Annual Non-Residential Renewable Energy Solutions Program Review – Year 2, issuing a Decision on November 9, 2022 (Year 2 Decision).  The Decision finalized the Year 2 Program Manual, established NRES Program price caps for project bids received in calendar year 2023, and authorized several changes to the Program’s application requirements to better align the Program with the Program Objectives.  

# C. CONDUCT OF THE PROCEEDING  

On May 10, 2023, the Authority issued the Notice of Proceeding in the abovecaptioned proceeding.  

On June 1, 2023, the Authority issued a Notice of Request for Written Comments on the following topics: price cap methodology; Shared Clean Energy Facility (SCEF)  

Program price cap matching; bidding above the price cap; Netting price cap value; Netting Calculator timing; Distressed Municipality bid preference expansion and grace period allowance; metering delays and availability; carport and/or solar canopy bid preference; Buy-All cash out policy; brownfield definition; ombudsperson inclusion; interconnection barriers; and motion for extension requirements.  On or before June 16, 2023, the Authority received thirteen sets of written comments from interested stakeholders.  

On June 22, 2023, the Authority held a Technical Meeting to discuss the topics included in the June 1, 2023 Notice of Request for Written Comments.  

On July 21, 2023, the Authority issued a second Notice of Request for Written Comments on the following topics: Distressed Municipality beneficial account location and project benefits; proof of site control for state, municipal, and agricultural (SAM) customers; megawatt allocation between EDCs, solicitations, and size categories; oversized system allowance under the Netting tariff; hosting capacity map upgrades; renewable energy certificate (REC) buybacks; Office of Education, Outreach, and Enforcement (EOE) support; recommended programmatic changes; performance assurance refund; and rooftop definition changes.  On or before August 23, 2023, the Authority received thirteen sets of written comments from interested stakeholders.  

On August 30, 2023, the Authority issued a third Notice of Request for Written Comments on the following topic: small zero emission category competitive solicitation. On or before September 15, 2023, the Authority received six sets of written comments from interested stakeholders.  

On September 12, 2023, the Authority held a second Technical Meeting to discuss the topics included in the July 21, 2023 Notice of Request for Written Comments.  

On September 13, 2023, the Authority issued a Notice of Request for Briefs with specific guidance for the Briefs in the instant proceeding.  The Authority received seven briefs on September 26, 2023, in response.

# D. PARTICIPANTS  

A listing of all Participants to this proceeding is appended hereto as Appendix A.  

# II. LEGAL AUTHORITY  

The NRES Program was established pursuant to Public Act No. 19-35, An Act Concerning a Green Economy and Environmental Protection, as codified in Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S$ 16-244z.  Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S16{-}244z(a)$ required that the Authority establish tariffs and a procurement plan for each EDC and requires that the EDCs conduct annual solicitation(s), as determined by the Authority, that would allow for a diversity of selected non-residential customer projects.  Pursuant to Public Act No. 22-14, An Act Concerning Clean Energy Tariff Programs, certain changes to the NRES Program were directed by the General Assembly, including an increase in the maximum allowed project size, an increase in the aggregate megawatt capacity available to non-residential customers in  

Program years two through six, and application of size-to-load provisions to rooftop nonresidential customer projects. $\S$ 4 Public Act No. 22-14.  Further, Public Act 23-102, An Act Strengthening Protections for Connecticut’s Consumers of Energy, exempted SAM customers from the requirement that projects owned or developed for such customers be located on the customer’s own premise, consistent with the intention to allow SAM customers to virtually net meter through the NRES Program. $\S$ 25 Public Act No. 23-102.  

As previously stated, the Authority indicated in the Non-Residential Tariff Decision that it will initiate an annual docket to review key NRES Program metrics with stakeholders and to evaluate whether and how the Program should be modified to more fully accomplish the objectives established in the Non-Residential Tariff Decision.  NonResidential Tariff Decision, p. 46.  This annual docket is also intended to review and incorporate into the NRES Program applicable statutory changes.  

Herein, the Authority reviews the NRES Program documents and Program Manual, relevant compliance filings, and current tariff rates to determine if and how the NRES Program can and should be modified to better align with the direction provided in the NonResidential Tariff Decision, inclusive of the program objectives and Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S$ 16-244z, as modified by Public Act No. 22-14.  

# III. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES  

In the Non-Residential Tariff Decision, the Authority established the following five objectives to guide the development, implementation, and administration of the NRES Program (Program Objectives).  

1. Foster the sustained, orderly development of the state’s Class I renewable energy industry;   
2. Deploy the full megawatt capacity allowable under statute, to the extent possible (see Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S16{-}244z(\mathsf{c})(1)(\mathsf{A}))$ ;   
3. Ensure least-cost outcomes through the annual solicitation process;   
4. Enable program accessibility for customers through simplified program and tariff designs; and   
5. Encourage increased inclusivity overall, as well as program participation by customers in underserved and environmental justice communities.  

Non-Residential Tariff Decision, p. 7.  

Accordingly, the Authority relied on the Program Objectives in evaluating the current NRES Program design and assessing any possible changes to be ordered in this Decision to better align the NRES Program with the direction provided in the NonResidential Tariff Decision.  Relatedly, the Authority reaffirms that the Program Objectives shall guide the Program Administrators in their administration of the NRES Program, particularly in instances not explicitly addressed through the approved NRES Program documents or through Authority direction in prior Decisions or motion rulings.  Finally, the Authority clarifies that the fifth Program Objective, increased inclusivity overall, shall be explicitly guided by a goal of $40\%$ deployment in Distressed Municipalities, in line with  

Justice 40 goals used by other statewide clean energy programs, to ensure participation of underserved communities in the NRES Program.1  

# IV. AUTHORITY ANALYSIS  

# A. PROGRAM OVERVIEW  

In the Non-Residential Tariff Decision, the Authority created a statewide, six-year non-residential solar program to be administered by the EDCs in their respective service territories.  Pursuant to Public Act No. 19-35, the NRES Program was established to ensure the continued growth of the state’s Class I renewable energy industry upon the conclusion of the prior LREC/ZREC and VNM programs.  Zero-emission NRES projects less than or equal to 200 kilowatts (kW) are awarded compensation agreements on a first-come, first-served basis, while zero-emission projects greater than $200\mathsf{k W}$ and less than or equal to $5{,}000\mathsf{k W}$ , or 5 megawatts (MW), are awarded compensation agreements through a competitive solicitation process subject to price caps for medium and large zero-emission project categories.  Low emissions projects less than or equal to 5 MW are also awarded compensation agreements through a competitive solicitation process.  

Approved projects are eligible to sell energy and RECs to the EDCs at a fixed 20- year price by selecting one of the following two compensation structures: (1) Buy-All or (2) Netting.  Under the Buy-All rate structure, the EDCs purchase all the energy produced by the solar project.  Conversely, under the Netting rate structure, monetary monthly onbill credits, which continuously roll over, are provided through the customer’s electric bill for any energy exported to the electric grid and not consumed on site.  Additionally, REC payments are issued by the EDCs under a separate bid structure and are paid out quarterly.  

During the annual review process, the Authority evaluates whether the Program is achieving its objectives, including whether the Program is meeting the target deployment of 110 MW per year.  The annual Program review may lead to the adjustment of Program incentives, rules, and price caps as needed, to meet programmatic goals.  Table 1 below shows the total number of projects and MWs selected in the Year 1 (2022) NRES solicitation and the first of two Year 2 (2023) solicitations, which was initiated in February 2023.  Data from the second Year 2 (2023) solicitation, which was initiated in August 2023, was not available at the time this Decision was issued.

# B. PRICE CAP  

In the following section, the Authority reviews stakeholder comments and NRES bid solicitation data to determine whether changes are warranted to the NRES price cap methodology established in the Year 2 Decision, to further the Program Objectives and to support the continued success of the NRES Program.  The Authority ultimately concludes that the current, general price cap methodology achieves the Program Objectives, but that updates to the Netting comparison methodology and Netting REC price caps are warranted this year given the anomalous electricity supply conditions in early 2023.  Moreover, the Authority provides greater certainty regarding the calculation of the price caps moving forward.  

# 1. General Methodology  

The Authority announced its intention to use this proceeding to set NRES Year 3 price caps and consequently requested written comments from stakeholders on any suggested changes to the methodology used to set price caps last year.  Notice, June 1, 2023, p. 1.  

Allco Renewable Energy Limited (Allco) responded by recommending that the Authority base NRES price caps on “the displacement or substation value to ratepayers” for each NRES project category.  Allco Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 1.  Further, Bloom Energy Corporation (Bloom Energy) stated that price caps should be adjusted upward using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and noted that no adjustment was made last year to reflect the $15.63\%$ rise in inflation that occurred between the first and second Program years.  Bloom Energy Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 1.  Additionally, the Connecticut Solar and Storage Association (ConnSSA) advocated for a price cap plus reverse auction methodology.  ConnSSA Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 1-2.  ConnSSA also cautioned against using year-old data to set price caps and argued that the price caps be indexed to inflation or some other metric to allow them to go up as project costs increase.  Id., p. 2.  Moreover, TRITEC Americas, LLC (TRITEC) opined that the price cap should be set at the “highest price bid in the previous solicitation.”  Id., p. 2.  

Verogy disagreed with the existence of a price cap so long as the marketplace was oversubscribed.  Verogy Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 1.  Nevertheless, should a price cap exist, Verogy suggested setting the cap at $125\%$ of the number given by the current methodology, to allow the price caps “to take into account changing market conditions.” Id., p. 2.  Verogy expressed concern that the current methodology will make projects unviable if price caps only have the ability to decrease over time as project costs rise.  Id. Separately, FuelCell Energy, Inc. (FuelCell) argued for equal price caps across all project categories to avoid granting the equivalency of a bid preference to certain project categories.  FuelCell Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 3.  FuelCell also noted that the low emission category price cap was not based on actual bid data in the Year 2 Decision and, accordingly, argued that the price cap for the low emission category be based on actual low emission project bid data, to ensure low emission projects are able to compete in the NRES Program.  Id., pp. 4-5.  Last, FuelCell requested the Authority take into account inflation and the effects of the pandemic when considering Year 3 NRES price caps.  Id., p. 5.  

Conversely, the EDCs stated that the Year 2 February procurement was held without incident and consequently recommended that the Authority “maintain a price capsetting methodology that can be replicated annually and therefore anticipated by the industry and program participants.”  EDC Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 2-3.  The EDCs further argued against annual redesigns in the price cap methodology and stated that the current methodology is “a transparent and unbiased method of ensuring least cost outcome.”  Id., p. 3.  

Pursuant to Order No. 3 of the Year 2 Decision, the EDCs submitted price caps for the Authority’s review and approval in this proceeding.  Motion No. 4, Aug. 1, 2023.  The EDCs’ proposed price caps for the competitive NRES emission categories are the greater of the highest selected bid or the eightieth percentile bid price in each category, thereby reflecting the Authority’s Year 2 methodology.  Id., p. 1.  Since no bids were selected for low emission projects, the suggested price cap for this category was unchanged from the prior year.  Id., p. 2.  Additionally, the EDCs suggested that the Year 3 price cap for the noncompetitive small zero emission category decline by $\$1.15$ to $\$190.82$ , to maintain the $5.78\%$ difference between the small and medium categories present in Year 2.  Id.  

Table 2: EDC-Proposed Price Caps   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Size Category</td><td>Year 2 Price Cap</td><td>Year 3 Proposed Price Cap</td><td>Proposed Change Amount</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>$/MWh） $200.97</td><td>($/MWh） $199.82</td><td>($/MWh） -$1.15</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>$190.00</td><td>$188.90</td><td>-$1.10</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>$159.00</td><td>$145.97</td><td>-$13.03</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>$159.00</td><td>$159.00</td><td>$0.00</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Motion No. 4, p. 2.  

Both Eversource and UI received a greater number of bids in the Year 2 February solicitation than in Year 1 of the Program, thereby reflecting the continued success of the solicitation process using the Year 2 price cap methodology.  EDC Corresp., June 27, 2023, pp. 4, 9.  Accordingly, the Authority determines that no changes are warranted to the general methodology used to set the Year 2 price caps and, consequently, accepts the EDCs’ proposed price caps for Year 3.  However, importantly, as discussed below, the Authority will carefully monitor the impact of the price cap methodology on the overall success of the Program and may consider changes to the methodology in future years, particularly if inflation returns to 2022 levels (i.e., upwards of $6.5\%$ ).  

Additionally, given the robust participation of small zero emission projects in the Year 2 February solicitation, the Authority concludes that the difference between the small and medium emission price caps shall not exceed the difference from the Year 2 program of $5.78\%$ to ensure ratepayers do not unnecessarily provide incentives that would otherwise be unneeded to fund the development of small zero emission projects, which, unlike the other project emission categories, are noncompetitive.  EDC Corresp., June 27, 2023, pp. 7, 10.  

The Authority clarifies that the price cap for the low emission category shall be set using accepted low emission bids, when applicable, in a manner similar to the other competitive categories.  Further, while no low emission bids were selected in the Year 2 February procurement, the Authority notes that solar projects also qualify for the low emission category under the current Program Manual.  EDC Compliance, March 13, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, Attachment 2b, pp. 13-14.  

Ultimately, the Authority concludes that the general price cap methodology set last year supports the Program Objectives, particularly objectives one, three, and four, by providing stakeholders with a methodology that is accessible and easy to understand, while ensuring least-cost outcomes through a competitive process.  The Authority will nevertheless continue to monitor project participation and market conditions, such as inflation, and reserves the right to adjust the price cap methodology as needed in future Program years.  Notably, the Authority will only make changes to the general methodology if evidence is presented in future annual review proceedings that such changes would support the Program Objectives, and if project participation levels necessitate such a change.  

# 2. Netting Calculator and Netting REC Price Caps  

The Authority requested written comments from stakeholders to determine whether the current Netting comparison methodology (Netting Calculator)3 and Netting REC price caps are preventing Netting projects from participating in the NRES Program and/or affecting Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (CPACE) Program eligibility, as asserted by some stakeholders.4  Notice, June 1, 2023, p. 2; Bloom Energy Corresp., May 22, 2023, pp. 1, 3; Greenleaf Motion No. 8 Comments, Docket No. 22-08- 03, p. 1.  Further, the Authority noted that any changes to the Netting Calculator would need to maintain mathematical equivalency between Netting and Buy-All price caps, in line with the Authority’s determination in the Year 2 Decision.  Notice, June 1, 2023, p. 3; Year 2 Decision, pp. 20-27.  The Authority also reminded docket Participants that any significant programmatic change would require justification including data, and “detailed substantiation and documentation of any such data and analysis.”  Id.  

In response, Independence Solar argued that the Netting REC price cap should be consistent across “all customers classes and EDCs,” because it was illogical for RECs to vary across customers, since RECs have the same market value.  Independence Solar Corresp., June 15, 2023, p. 1.  Bloom Energy argued for a return to the Year 1 Netting REC price caps.  Bloom Energy Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 2.  Bloom Energy also asserted that the current Netting REC price cap methodology prohibited the participation of several behind-the-meter projects.  Id.  Moreover, ConnSSA believed that Netting REC values should not be tied to rate structure and noted that under the current methodology many Netting projects will have REC values of zero.  ConnSSA Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 1.  ConnSSA also advocated for the use of more current energy rates “instead of averaging over the past 11 months of the year” so that “more timely information” could be used in the calculation.  Id.  ConnSSA further noted that many customers do not buy energy from the EDCs and consequently have a lower rate than what is used in the Netting price cap formula.  Id., p. 3.  Additionally, HyAxiom argued that the current Netting REC price cap methodology prohibited many customers from pursuing the Netting tariff solely because of their rate class, particularly if the rate class’s REC value was zero or negative, because positive REC values are needed to incentivize project development. HyAxiom Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 3.  Consequently, HyAxiom advocated for a return to the Year 1 Netting REC price caps.  Id., pp. 3-4.  

Further, Verogy suggested that Netting price caps be set at a value that is not below the Alternative Compliance Payment of $\$40/M W h$ .  Verogy Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 4.  Verogy also believes that Buy-All projects have a significant advantage over Netting bids and expected that few Netting projects were selected in the competitive medium, large, or low emission NRES categories.  Id., p. 5.  Verogy consequently suggested several improvements to the Netting Calculator to further the Program Objectives.  Id., pp. 5-7.  First, Verogy argued that the Netting Calculator should use “12 trailing months of publicly available $3^{\mathrm{rd}}$ party supply rates” because the current calculation overstates retail rates by excluding lower-priced third-party supply rates, thereby resulting in a lower Netting price cap.  Id., pp. 5-6.  Second, Verogy indicated that solar degradation rates, industry accepted as $0.50\%$ per year, should be factored into the Netting Calculator by “reducing the current $2.50\%$ Retail Rate escalator used in the NPV Retail Rate calculation to $2.00\%$ ,” thereby increasing Netting price caps.  Id., p. 6.  Finally, Verogy argued for “full retail rate net metering outside of the NRES program.”  Id.  Verogy asserts that such change would “allow commercial customers to meet any sustainability goals by retiring RECs rather than selling them.”  Id., p. 7.  

In contrast, the EDCs opined “that the calculation of REC values at or below zero for netting projects is an intended outcome [to prevent] projects from receiving ratepayer funded incentives that are unnecessary to achieve reasonable returns.”  EDC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 5.  REC values at or below zero are also not unique to the NRES Program because rising electric rates and declining solar costs have made additional incentives beyond on-bill credits unnecessary in some cases, the EDCs observed.  Id. The EDCs ultimately argued “that the current methodology for evaluating netting bids is most fair and adequately contemplates the potential value of energy over the 20-year term.”  Id., p. 6.  Last, the Office of Consumer Counsel (OCC) supported requiring empirical evidence from stakeholders on the effects of the Netting price cap methodology to support any potential changes.  OCC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 2.  

Upon reviewing stakeholder comments and NRES bid solicitation data, the Authority concludes that a one-time change (i.e., to be implemented solely for 2024) is warranted for the NRES Netting Calculator.  In support of the first and second Program Objectives, the Authority finds that the current methodology is unduly prohibitive for Netting project participation.  Notably, across both EDCs, nine Netting bids were selected in competitive NRES project categories in the Year 2 February solicitation; however, five such bids were declined.  UI Compliance to Order No. 6, Sept. 21, 2023, Docket No. 22- 08-03; Eversource Compliance to Order No. 6, Sep. 28, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03.  In contrast, 35 Buy-All bids were selected and only one such bid was declined, meaning four Netting bids and 34 Buy-All bids progressed past the bid acceptance stage of the February 2023 solicitation.  Id.  

Based on the foregoing, the Authority acknowledges the current inequity in the split between the Netting and Buy-All tariff bids in the latest solicitation.  While such inequity does not appear to have hindered the ability of the NRES Program to attract viable bids, it is nonetheless important to ensure that both tariff options are as financially equivalent as practicable so as not to discourage participation by viable projects in furtherance of the first, second, and fourth Program Objectives, while achieving the third Objective to ensure least-cost outcomes.  

The Authority concludes that the current Netting Calculator does not accurately account for likely 2024 energy supply rates due to the anomalous economic conditions in 2023 resulting in a large jump in supply rates, as well as a significant gap between standard and third-party rates.  Notably, there was a particularly large rate increase from 2022 to 2023 for certain rates,5 which may not persist in full into 2024.  Consequently, the Authority determines that it is necessary to implement a one-time deviation from the existing calculator methodology of using retail electric rates from the previous 12-month period to set the Netting price cap for the following year.6  As a $2.5\%$ retail escalation rate has already been approved as a part of the Netting Calculator used for Year 2, the Authority provides the following direction for Year 3 Netting bid price cap calculations: for each rate class, the EDCs shall utilize the lower value between (1) the rate as included in the Year 3 NRES Netting Calculator,7 or (2) the rate as included in the Year 2 NRES Netting Calculator8 with a $2.5\%$ retail rate escalation applied, to arrive at an estimated retail rate under less anomalous economic conditions.  

The Authority authorizes this one-time change based on data provided in this record and thanks stakeholders for providing such information, as these necessary changes would not have been made otherwise.  The Authority opted for this simplified approach (as opposed to using the data provided by stakeholders) as there is insufficient record evidence to calculate the precise market share of any given supplier or the average supply rate appropriately weighted for third-party market supply, standard service supply, and last resort service supply over a calendar year.  Moreover, it is also unclear whether such an average supply rate or the 2023 spread between third-party supply rates and standard service or last resort service are indicative of future trends.  

In future Program years, the Authority may consider updating the calculator to more fully account for customers on third-party supply rates9 if stakeholders present the Authority with sufficient quantitative data and justification to determine the market average supply rate including third-party, standard service, and last resort service supply customer data for a calendar year, and there is an opportunity for broad stakeholder discussion. Specifically, such data would likely include the total percentage of energy supply to commercial and industrial customers that was purchased through third-party suppliers and the average of the rates provided by all of those providers, so that the impacts of third-party supply rates could be considered more holistically in any potential calculator updates.10  

The Authority declines to implement solar degradation at this time as such input is not taken into account in calculating the Buy-All compensation rate; thus, a change to only the Netting tariff calculation would result in an inequitable adjustment that would negatively impact the goal of maintaining mathematical equivalency between Netting and Buy-All price caps.  

Future changes to the Netting Calculator may be considered by the Authority if NRES Program participation levels or market conditions warrant such change, and detailed analysis and data demonstrating the impact of any such change are provided to the Authority.  Ultimately, the Authority will always balance all Program Objectives, including Objective Three, to ensure least-cost outcomes, in weighing any changes to the Netting Calculator methodology.  As such, the Authority will also consider the fact that the Netting Calculator does not account for avoided demand charges in any future updates. Avoided demand charges only benefit Netting tariff customers and, thus, their omission currently skews the Netting Calculator’s analysis.  If compelling evidence is not provided to change the Netting Calculator, the Authority will defer to the use of the Year 2 Netting Calculator methodology updated with rates from the previous 12-month period (i.e., absent the one-time adjustment authorized herein) in future NRES annual review proceedings.  

# 3. Price Cap and Netting Calculator Timing  

Order No. 14 of the Year 2 Decision, dated November 9, 2022, directed the EDCs to annually file, for the duration of the NRES Program, an updated Netting bid price calculator using current retail rates to be used by bidders for the following year’s NRES solicitations by December 15.  Year 2 Decision, pp. 7, 41.  

Thereafter, on January 10, 2023, ConnSSA submitted Motion No. 8 in Docket No. 22-08-03 requesting the Authority delay the effective date of the Year 2 Netting Calculator by one solicitation, from February to August, “to give market participants ample time to adapt and communicate project development changes,” and to further the first, second, and fourth Program Objectives.  Motion No. 8, Docket No. 22-08-03, p. 1.  In the Motion No. 8 Ruling, the Authority denied ConnSSA’s request to delay implementation of the Year 2 Calculator.  However, to alleviate ConnSSA’s concerns, the EDCs were directed to submit a draft Netting Calculator as compliance in Docket No. 23-08-03 on or before September 29, 2023.  Motion No. 8 Ruling, Jan. 25, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, pp. 2-3. The Authority further stated that it would consider a permanent change to the timing of the EDCs’ compliance with Order No. 14 of the Year 2 Decision, specifically considering a September due date, through Docket No. 23-08-03 and subsequently requested written comments from stakeholders on the permanence of such change.  Id., p. 3; Notice, June 1, 2023, pp. 3-4.  

In response to the Authority’s request for written comments, Independence Solar stated that the Netting Calculator should be approved by the Authority “at least four (4) months prior to the first solicitation of each program year.”  Independence Solar Corresp., June 15, 2023, p. 1.  Additionally, ConnSSA stated that a September due date for the Netting Calculator would be helpful.  ConnSSA Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 3. Moreover, Verogy agreed with ConnSSA, and argued for a permanent September 14 due date for the Netting Calculator, because the change would foster the Program Objectives, and because the information used by the EDCs to create the calculator should be available July 1 each year.  Verogy Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 7-8.  

The EDCs conversely were “concerned that the risks of filing multiple Netting Calculators may outweigh the advantages of providing more advance notice.”  EDC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 7.  For example, the final Netting Calculator may have a different methodology than the draft version, because of potential Authority changes to the Buy-All and/or Netting bid price calculations in the Authority’s annual review decision. Id.  Further, the EDCs noted that the NRES price caps are determined from the selected bids of the entire annual solicitation, which are not known until after the completion of the August procurement and when such data is filed with the Authority in December 2023. Id.  Ultimately, the EDCs opined that changes to the Netting Calculator timing are not needed because projects should be able to respond to changing market conditions.  Id., pp. 7-8.  Last, OCC argued that the Netting Calculator “be applied and put into use promptly unless evidence is presented showing benefit to ratepayers.”  OCC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 2.  

The Authority finds that a permanent change in the issuance date of the Netting Calculator is needed to give developers enough time to determine the economics of a Netting NRES bid, and to further the first and fourth Program Objectives by sustaining the orderly development of the state’s Class I renewable energy industry and by enabling program accessibility.  The due date for Order No. 14 of the Year 2 Decision is consequently updated to September 14 annually for the remainder of the NRES Program. Moreover, since the results of that year’s August solicitation will not be available when the calculator is filed, the EDCs shall use the results of the penultimate August solicitation (i.e., for Year 3, the Year 1 August solicitation), in addition to the most recent February solicitation, when determining the subsequent year’s bid price caps, inclusive of the Netting bid price caps  

Finally, the Authority may annually update the price caps and Netting Calculator after September 14 through the final Decision issued in the NRES program review each year, but only if compelling evidence is provided that an update to the price cap or Netting Calculator methodologies are warranted in furtherance of the Program Objectives.  The Authority will judiciously consider and apply such changes as they may lead to developer confusion, as noted by the EDCs; thus, the benefits of any approved changes must outweigh the potential costs of added confusion.  Thus, the rebuttable presumption shall be that no changes to the price cap methodology or Netting Calculator are warranted.  If no changes to the price caps or Netting Calculator are made in the annual NRES program review decision, the price caps submitted on August 1 and the Netting Calculator submitted on September 14 shall be deemed final and authorized for use in the subsequent NRES program year.  

# 4. SCEF Price Cap Matching  

The Authority requested written comments on whether the price caps “should be equivalent across the NRES and Shared Clean Energy Facilities (SCEF) Programs, and if so, any recommendations on the methodology to be used in both programs and/or the value of the price caps.”  Notice, June 1, 2023, p. 2.  

Independence Solar noted in response that because many smaller projects participate in the NRES Program in contrast to the SCEF Program, the price caps should not be equivalent across both programs.  Independence Solar Corresp., June 15, 2023, p. 1.  Further, Allco argued against NRES and SCEF price cap matching, because the two programs have different features with SAM NRES projects requiring a bid price that includes benefits for the SAM customer.  Allco Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 2-3. Additionally, ConnSSA and FuelCell Energy opposed SCEF and NRES price cap matching.  ConnSSA Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 2; FuelCell Energy Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 3.  Verogy also recommended that the price caps for both programs remain different because of the programs’ distinct characteristics, including: different target markets; different interconnection options; different governing rules; and different structures.  Verogy Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 2-3.  TRITEC also opposed alignment of the programs’ price caps highlighting the differences between the two programs. TRITEC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 2.  

Alternatively, Bloom Energy and HyAxiom supported NRES and SCEF price cap matching because both programs have a five MW project size cap, and because both the SCEF Program and the NRES Buy-All tariff serve front-of-the-meter (FTM) projects. Bloom Energy Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 1; HyAxiom Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 2.  Further, DEEP encouraged the Authority to compare large project bids in the NRES and SCEF solicitations, and, if there was sufficient competition in NRES at or below the SCEF price cap, DEEP opined that the NRES price cap should be aligned with the SCEF price cap.  DEEP Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 2.  DEEP noted that since the project size limit for both programs is now the same with the passage of Public Act No. 22-14, a project may participate in both programs, and, consequently, “the program with the lower price cap may not receive as many bids.”  Id.  Moreover, the EDCs recommended alignment of the NRES and SCEF price caps.  EDC Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 3-4. More specifically, the EDCs supported alignment of the NRES Buy-All price cap for at least some NRES project categories with the SCEF price cap, which, for year five of the SCEF Program, could be set at approximately $\$133$ .  Id., p. 4.  Last, OCC recommended additional analysis be conducted before a determination is made to align the price caps for both programs.  OCC Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 1-2.  

The Authority determines that alignment of the SCEF and NRES price caps is not appropriate at this time, because the NRES bid data does not currently support alignment. Specifically, nine out of 16 selected NRES projects in the large category were above the SCEF price cap of $\$1$ 135/MWh for the February NRES solicitation.  UI Compliance to Order No. 8, June 30, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, Confidential Exhibit B2; Eversource Compliance to Order No. 5, July 7, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, Confidential Exhibit B2; Decision, Dec. 7, 2022, Docket No. 22-08-04, Annual Shared Clean Energy Facility Program Review – Year 4, p. 15.  Therefore, Program data suggests that a majority of large NRES projects would be unable to compete at the SCEF price cap.  Consequently, in support of the first and second NRES Program Objectives, fostering the sustained, orderly development of the state’s Class I renewable energy industry, and the deployment of the full MW capacity allowed by statute, the Authority declines to align the SCEF and NRES price caps at this time.  Nevertheless, the Authority concludes that alignment between the price caps for both programs, particularly between the large NRES category and the SCEF price cap, may be beneficial in the future, especially if bidding data from future NRES solicitations supports such alignment because equivalent price caps would support stakeholder accessibility for both programs through a simplified tariff design, while ensuring that one program does not unnecessarily compete with the other.  

# 5. Bidding Above the Price Cap  

In the Year 2 Decision, the Authority clarified that bidding above the price cap was not allowed, even if the bid price inclusive of the bid preference was at or below the price cap.  Year 2 Decision, pp. 18-19.  The Authority nonetheless stated its willingness to revisit this topic in the next annual review proceeding, “dependent on robust stakeholder discussion and the receipt of more evidence.”  Id., p. 19.  

Accordingly, Independence Solar, ConnSSA, and TRITEC argued that bidding above the price cap should be allowed, so long as the bid preference enabled a final bid price below the cap.  Independence Solar Corresp., June 15, 2023, p. 1; TRITEC Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 2-3; ConnSSA Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 2.  Allco also stated that bids above the price cap should be allowed, adding that, in contrast to the NRES Program, the federal tax structure and Massachusetts clean energy programs increase economic incentives for priority customers.  Allco Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 2.  Moreover, Verogy argued that, since price caps are expected to decrease over time under the current methodology, bid preferences are unlikely to support the cost premiums required to site projects in preferential areas, such as brownfields or carports, in future Program years.  Verogy Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 3-4.  

Alternatively, the Connecticut Industrial Energy Consumers (CIEC) stated that the Authority should not approve bidding above the price cap without first considering potential rate impacts.  CIEC Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 3-4.  CIEC further noted that bids above the price cap “could increase procurement costs to customers without increasing the benefits associated with that investment.”  Id., p. 4.  Similarly, OCC argued that additional cost-benefit analysis was warranted before granting exceptions to the price cap.  OCC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 2.  Additionally, HyAxiom argued that bids above the price cap defeat “the entire purpose of a price cap and therefore should not be allowed.”  HyAxiom Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 2.  DEEP also argued against bids above the price cap because it did not foster competition.  DEEP Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 2.  Finally, the EDCs did not recommend allowing bids above the price cap.  EDC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 4.  The EDCs noted that even if bids above the price cap had been allowed, most such bids would not have been selected given the robust competition that occurred throughout the Year 2 February NRES solicitation.  Id.  The EDCs believe that the price cap “remains an important safeguard of ratepayer costs,” which prevents program cost increases.  Id.  

Upon weighing stakeholder comments, the Authority concludes that bids above the price cap should generally not be allowed in the NRES Program because such change would hinder the Program Objectives, including the fifth Program Objective, enabling least-cost outcomes.  Further, as highlighted by the EDCs, competition in the NRES Program remains robust, with the number of bids received exceeding the capacity available in most categories in the Year 2 February solicitation.  EDC Corresp., June 19, 2023, pp. 5, 10, 15.  Therefore, Program data suggests bids above the price cap are not needed to support general Program enrollment.  

Nevertheless, given the lack of solar canopy project participation in the Program to date, even with a solar canopy bid preference, the Authority concludes that solar canopy projects may bid above the Program cap price, so long as the final bid price inclusive of the bid preference does not exceed the Program price cap.  UI Compliance to Order No. 8, June 30, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, Confidential Exhibit B2; Eversource Compliance to Order No. 5, July 7, 2023.  As discussed in the Year 2 Decision, solar canopies provide unique societal and environmental benefits, including: (1) increasing behind-the-meter project deployment in environmental justice communities, which tend to have more paved surfaces (and thus more opportunity for canopy projects); and (2) encouraging the preservation of undeveloped land, thereby furthering state preservation goals.  Year 2 Decision, p. 18.  Consequently, the Authority concludes that any negative impacts of allowing bids above the price cap for solar canopies (e.g., higher ratepayer costs) are likely offset by the unique benefits of solar canopy projects, which are not present in other project types.  Finally, the Authority clarifies that hybrid solar canopy projects will not be allowed to bid above the price cap.  Notably, allowing hybrid projects to bid above the price cap would create Program inefficiencies necessitating a redesign of the Netting Calculator and Program bidding system, thereby hindering the first Program Objective, the sustained and orderly development of the state’s Class I renewable energy industry, and the fourth Program Objective, enabling Program accessibility through simplified tariff designs.  Eversource Exceptions, Nov. 1, 2023, p. 3; UI Exceptions, Nov. 1, 2023, p. 3.  

# 6. Small Zero Emission Category Solicitation Methodology  

In the Non-Residential Tariff Decision, the Authority determined that the price cap for the small zero emission project category would be administratively set on a first-come, first-served basis.  Non-Residential Tariff Decision, p. 18.  The Authority’s rationale for this decision included the administrative burden of the competitive solicitation process for small projects and small project undersubscription in the predecessor ZREC Program. Id.  However, a competitive solicitation for small zero emission projects would likely result in lower compensation rates.  

The small zero emission category was significantly oversubscribed in both the Year 1 and February Year 2 solicitations at current Program incentive levels.  For example, in the February 2023 solicitation, 20.74 MW of small zero emission bids were received in the Eversource service territory, while only 12 MW were available.  EDC Corresp., June 27, 2023, p. 5.  Similarly, in the February 2023 solicitation for UI’s service territory, 7 MW of small zero emission bids were received, while only 3 MW were available. Id., p. 10.  

Consequently, the Authority requested written comments from all stakeholders on whether the small zero emission project category should follow the same methodology used to set price caps in the medium, large, and low emission categories (i.e., a competitive solicitation).  Notice, Aug. 30, 2023, pp. 1-2.  In response, Eversource and UI pointed to the redlined Program documents filed under Motion No. 5 in the present docket and provided no additional comments.  Eversource Comments, Sept. 14, 2023, p. 1; UI Comments, Sept. 14, 2023, p. 2.  The EDCs proposed that small zero emission projects be chosen through one rolling solicitation, with all small zero emission capacity being made available in February and closing on the date the August bids are due for the competitive project categories.  Motion No. 5, p. 24.  Further, ConnSSA stated that there was no consensus among its members on how the small zero emission category should change.  ConnSSA Comments, Sept. 14, 2023, p. 1.  Regarding a competitive solicitation specifically, ConnSSA noted that the financial feasibility of a 30 kW project differs greatly from a 130 kW project.  Id., p. 2.  While developers favored a process that gave “preference to the most serious applicants,” which a competitive process may favor, predictability was “critically important for [s]maller projects … and [s]witching to a bid system adds uncertainty.”  Id.  

Additionally, Verogy argued for a return to the Year 1 methodology for selecting small zero emission projects (i.e., a lottery if submitted within a two-week window), “with any remaining capacity being awarded thereafter on a first-come-first-served basis.” Verogy Comments, Sept. 11, 2023, p. 1.  Verogy averred that the Year 1 methodology is easier for small projects to comprehend than a competitive solicitation.  Id., p. 2. Moreover, a lottery would be “much more equitable and inclusive than” a competitive solicitation or the current first-come, first-served methodology.  Id.  Verogy also noted that all available small capacity was allocated within thirty minutes of the bid portal opening, thereby increasing the chance that incomplete bids or bids containing errors were submitted.  Id., p. 3.  Ultimately, Verogy stated that “small businesses and vulnerable Customers suffer from the current first-come-first-served award process because they often lack ample resources to submit NRES bids within the first few hours (or less) of portal opening.”  Id., p. 2.  

Shaker Clean Energy argued against a competitive solicitation and believes that the small zero emission category was significantly undersized.  Shaker Clean Energy Comments, Sept. 15, 2023, p. 1.  Shaker Clean Energy also argued for a $300\%$ increase in the small zero emission MW allocation to account for outstanding small project demand not currently being met in the NRES Program.  Id., p. 2.  Shaker Clean Energy believed that a competitive solicitation for small zero emission projects would harm small businesses and the Program Objectives.  Id., p. 4.  In contrast, OCC supported a competitive solicitation for small zero emission projects.  OCC Comments, Sept. 14, 2023, p. 1.  

The Authority determines that the small zero emission category shall return to the Year 1 methodology where small zero emission projects were chosen via a lottery if bids exceeded the available capacity during a predetermined two-week window.  The Authority finds that the first-come, first-served Year 2 methodology may harm small developers who do not have the staff or resources to compete with larger companies who submitted multiple bids immediately when the bid portal opened, to the detriment of the fifth Program Objective, increased inclusivity overall.  Additionally, as suggested by Verogy, the current first-come, first-served methodology may have led to, and if left as-is, continue to lead to, an increased number of applications with curable errors as developers rush to submit bids immediately when the portal opens.  Further, an increase in curable errors may increase programmatic costs as the Program Administrators spend more time reviewing or correcting deficient applications.  However, the Authority concedes that a two-week window and lottery system may also increase bidder confusion, which, if true, would harm the fourth Program Objective, enabling Program accessibility.  Year 2 Decision, p. 19. The Authority, however, concludes that the benefits of the Year 1 methodology, including increased inclusivity and a more equitable solicitation process, outweigh the potential drawbacks.  Furthermore, the EDCs’ annual bidders’ conference and informational webinar should help alleviate any developer confusion over the Year 1 methodology.  

Finally, the Authority declines to approve a rolling solicitation for the small zero emission category to maintain consistency between the general timelines for the small zero emission and competitive categories.  A biannual solicitation also provides developers more opportunities to receive solicitation awards, whereas opening a rolling solicitation after the 2-week lottery period closes may result in the entire small category capacity being filled as early as February.  Consequently, the Authority finds that biannual solicitations advance the first Program Objective, the sustained and orderly development of the state’s Class I renewable energy industry, by preventing costly year-long delays in project development if a bid is not selected during the first yearly solicitation.  

# C. MEGAWATT ALLOCATION  

# 1. Between EDCs  

The Authority previously noted that it would “be receptive to legislation which allowed for statewide solicitations without prescribing capacity to specific EDCs, to better achieve the third Program Objective to ensure least cost outcomes.”  Year 2 Decision, p. 13.  Public Act 23-102 recently amended Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S$ 16-244(a)(2) to allow joint solicitations by the EDCs.  Accordingly, the Authority sought stakeholder comments on updating the NRES Program to allow joint solicitations as opposed to the current individual solicitations between the two EDCs with an $80-20\%$ MW split.  Notice, July 21, 2023, pp. 3-4.  

DEEP strongly supported allowing for statewide procurements, stating that such a change would increase the cost-effectiveness of the program. DEEP Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 2.  OCC similarly supported the change, noting that ratepayers will generally save money through joint collaborations between the two EDCs and with “lower overhead, including staff and equipment costs, as well as potentially cheaper … solicitation costs, savings could be substantial.”  OCC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, pp. 6-7.  TRITEC also recommended updating the NRES program to allow joint solicitations by the EDCs. TRITEC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, pp. 5-6.  TRITEC specified that such joint solicitation should allow for SAM beneficial accounts to be matched with projects in either EDC service territory due to the differing characteristics of the two service territories, where UI has a greater share of densely populated distressed municipalities and Eversource has fewer urban areas but more open space to site carbon-free generation.  Id.  TRITEC suggested that these changes would advance the second, third, and fifth Program Objectives “by helping the state to deploy more carbon-free energy generation capacity by allowing more projects, ensuring the lowest cost projects possible by encouraging larger, more cost-efficient projects, and helping to increase participation in the program by allowing more distressed municipalities.”  Id.  

Verogy also supported the concept of joint solicitations because such a change would result in awards to the most cost-effective projects by allowing developers to choose sites based on suitability rather than EDC territory.  Verogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, pp. 4-5.  In addition, Verogy suggested that joint solicitations would reduce the likelihood of unused MW capacity in any one project category and “would help resolve the issue of available capacity in one given solicitation category not being enough to support the maximum system size allowed,” such as the 2 MW capacity available for low emission projects in UI service territory.  Id.  Like TRITEC, Verogy proposed that SAM projects should be allowed to assign beneficial accounts in either EDC service territory, based on concerns that projects could be disproportionately sited in Eversource service territory due to more development and higher property values in UI territory, potentially causing SAM projects in UI service territory to lose out on the benefits of the program.  Id.  

In contrast, the EDCs did not believe modifying the program to allow joint solicitations is necessary or warranted, as both EDCs have seen “robust competition in the NRES program since its inception.”  EDC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 7.  The EDCs further noted that NRES projects are load reducers and provide value to ratepayers; if selection is based solely on bid price, most selected projects would likely be in Eversource territory and UI customers would not gain the load reduction benefits as well as financial, social, and environmental benefits.  Id.  In addition, the EDCs suggested that joint solicitations would take longer than the current individual solicitations “as more collaboration around the rounds of selection, declined agreements, and other administrative obstacles would be required.”  Id.  Ecogy also opposed joint solicitations, suggesting the current $80-20\%$ MW split between the EDCs “should remain in line with market needs, utility territory size, and demand.”  Ecogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 3. In addition, Allco opposed modifying the $80{-}20\%$ split, suggesting that ISO New England (ISO-NE) and FERC rules related to such projects would change if one EDC begins selecting projects in another EDC’s service territory because the projects would then be considered wholesale sales under the Federal Power Act (FPA) and the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA).  Id.  

Allco also questioned the existence of substantial evidence that joint solicitations would lead to least-cost outcomes, in part because comparing bid prices alone does not account for “load-reducer” status of small generators in ISO-NE.  Id.  Further, Allco was concerned that projects in UI territory would no longer be selected under a statewide solicitation and would not gain the associated revenue or benefits, including distressed municipalities.  Id.  Vincent Candelora, House Republican Leader and Representative for the $86^{\mathrm{{th}}}$ District, which is located in the UI service territory, also expressed concern that most selected projects would likely be in Eversource territory and that UI customers would miss out on the various load reduction, financial, societal, and environmental benefits of renewable energy development.  Candelora Corresp., Aug. 25, 2023.  

The Authority reviewed bid data from previous solicitations to analyze whether joint statewide solicitations would have resulted in lower-cost outcomes than individual EDC solicitations and concludes that joint solicitations would have reduced ratepayer costs. Further, joint solicitations reduce the likelihood of unallocated capacity remaining in the large project category after the second annual solicitation for either EDC, which, according to the current Program Manual, can be partly reallocated to the medium project category.  Motion No. 13, Dec. 15, 2022, Docket No. 22-08-03, Attachment 1B, p. 29.  As large projects have the lowest average bid price per kWh, this change further reduces Program costs.  In total, the Authority finds that holding a joint solicitation in Program Year 1 would have resulted in an average bid price about $4.3\%$ lower, or a difference of about $\$6.58$ per MWh, weighted across the medium and large zero emission categories, as demonstrated in the table below.11  UI Compliance to Order No. 6, Sept. 21, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, Attachment 1; Eversource Compliance to Order No. 6, Sept. 28, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03.  Ultimately, a joint solicitation would have resulted in total ratepayer savings of approximately $\$2.4$ million and led to an additional 1 MW being selected.  

Table 3:  Program Year 1 Bid Solicitation Analysis   


<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Actual Year 1 Solicitation Results</td><td>Counterfactual Resultsunder Statewide Solicitation</td></tr><tr><td>Large Capacity Committed (MW)</td><td>19.205</td><td>22.48</td></tr><tr><td>Medium Capacity Committed (MW)</td><td>17.003</td><td>14.738</td></tr><tr><td>Large Weighted Average Bid Price S per Mwh)</td><td>$143.14</td><td>$137.38</td></tr><tr><td>Medium Weighted Average Bid Price ($ per MWh)</td><td>$163.78</td><td>$159.79</td></tr><tr><td>TotalWeightedAverage Bid Price $ per Mwh)</td><td>$152.83</td><td>$146.25</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The above analysis and stakeholder comments provide a valuable starting point in the evaluation of conducting a potential statewide solicitation for competitively awarded NRES Program categories.  The assessment that a joint solicitation could reduce the likelihood of unused large zero emission Program MW capacity is especially compelling, particularly as it could lead to the selection of more large zero emission projects in the UI service territory.  Moreover, it is notable that if a joint solicitation were to have occurred in 2022, over $90\%$ of the capacity bid in UI territory in the medium zero emission category would have been selected.  However, more NRES Program data is necessary to further evaluate and confirm these initial results.  

Additionally, the Authority recognizes that allowing SAM projects to designate beneficial accounts in either EDC service territory may provide benefits to Distressed Municipalities, particularly those less likely to have NRES projects selected under statewide procurements if projects are required to be in the same service territory as the Distressed Municipality that it benefits.  As demonstrated by the above summary of stakeholder comments on the topic, additional discussion and quantitative evidence of costs and benefits of allowing SAM projects to designate beneficial accounts in either EDC service territory is needed.  

Last, the Authority acknowledges that the EDCs will require time to develop procedures for implementing any potential joint solicitations and that a more specific proposal is necessary to fully understand and evaluate the pros and costs of such an approach.12  Accordingly, the Authority directs the EDCs to file a proposed, alternative procurement plan for conducting a joint, statewide solicitation in the next annual review proceeding no later than June 1, 2024.  The procurement plan shall include a methodology for allocation of costs and benefits of selected NRES projects among the EDCs, including at least one option for allowing SAM projects to designate beneficial accounts in either EDC service territory, and shall identify any potential barriers to implementation and propose solutions to the identified barriers.  Additionally, the proposed, alternative procurement plan shall maintain the current $80{-}20\%$ split for both EDCs for the small zero emission project category as a statewide procurement of uncompetitive small zero emission projects would not provide cost savings over the current approach.  The EDCs shall collaborate with the ombudsperson authorized in Section IV.I. in developing such procurement plan upon the ombudsperson’s retention. Ultimately, the proposed, alternative plan must be provided in the form of redline edits to the current Program Manual and accompanied by a document inclusive of (1) an explanation of the proposed redline edits and (2) the above requirements.  

The above approach will allow the Authority, and all stakeholders, sufficient time to appropriately weigh the pros and cons of a potential statewide procurement and an opportunity for robust stakeholder discussion on the topic in the next annual NRES Program review proceeding.  

# 2. Between Solicitations  

The Authority sought stakeholder comments on the MW allocation between NRES solicitations.  Notice, July 21, 2023, pp. 3-4.  TRITEC recommended that the MW allocations be split equally between the February and August NRES auctions, stating that “[t]here is no benefit to program participants, ratepayers, and the state in making the August NRES auction smaller than the February auction.”  TRITEC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 6.  TRITEC stated that this would further the first Program Objective by fostering the sustained and orderly development of carbon-free generation.  Id.  The Authority received no other comments on the topic.  

The Authority appreciates the comments provided by TRITEC, but does not find them sufficiently compelling to make a change, as the Authority finds that the benefits associated with maintaining consistency in solicitation processes between Program years outweigh potential benefits of changes to the capacity allocation between solicitations. As such, the EDCs shall continue to hold two solicitations per year for all categories, in February and August, and maintain the same percentage MW split between the two solicitations in Program Year 3.  Further, as discussed in Section IV.B.6, for the small zero emission category specifically, the EDCs shall return to the Year 1 solicitation methodology where small zero emission projects are chosen via a lottery.  The EDCs shall also continue to hold two annual solicitations for small zero emission projects coinciding with the solicitation schedule for the competitively selected project categories.  

# 3. Between Project Size Categories  

In the Year 2 Decision, the Authority stated that:  

In future Program reviews, the Authority will continue to monitor bid data and stakeholder input to confirm that the approved MW allocation is appropriate and in line with Program Objectives. The Authority will reapportion MW allocations and adjust rollover policies as necessary to ensure the continued success of the NRES Program. Specifically, the Authority will carefully monitor the small zero emission and low emission project categories to ensure that unused MW do not accrue in those categories to the potential detriment of project deployment in the medium and large zero emission project categories.  

Year 2 Decision, p. 14.  

In written comments, the EDCs noted that both Eversource and UI “received an overwhelming response to the small zero emission category in both the February and August RFPs.”  EDC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 7.  Consequently, the EDCs proposed reallocating capacity among the size categories to increase capacity in the small zero emission category.  Id.  UI also noted that there has been “minimal interest in the submission of Large Zero Emission projects sized up to 5 MW in UI territory thus far,” though UI acknowledged that the Year 2 August RFP results were not yet available.  Id. Specifically, the EDCs proposed increasing the small zero emission category total capacity from 25 MW to 42 MW per year and decreasing the large zero emission category from 42 MW to 25 MW per year.  EDC Comments, Aug. 23, 2023, p. 1.  

Conversely, TRITEC stated in written comments that Connecticut would only achieve $100\%$ carbon-free energy generation by 2040 by constructing “more and larger carbon-free energy generation projects.”  TRITEC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, pp. 6-7. TRITEC also noted that NRES auction results indicated the large zero emission category is consistently oversubscribed and competitive, while providing the greatest amount of carbon-free generation at the lowest ratepayer cost among the NRES categories.  Id.  As such, TRITEC recommended “substantially increasing” the MW capacity to allow more projects to move forward in the large zero emission category.  Id.  

The Authority notes that based on the Year 2 February solicitation data, the EDCs’ proposed reallocation of MW capacity between size categories would increase Program costs, as average costs per MWh decrease with increasing project size.  Specifically, the Authority estimates that the proposed size categories would have increased the total average bid cost per MWh for the Year 2 February solicitation by about $7\%$ , from $\$161.29$ per MWh to $\$172.69$ per MWh.13  UI Compliance to Order No. 6, Sept. 21, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, Attachment 1; Eversource Compliance to Order No. 6, Sept. 28, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03.  

The Authority recognizes the strong interest in the small zero emission project category, with the number of bids significantly exceeding the available capacity across both EDC service territories.  The Authority also recognizes that there was a large shift in the level of interest in the small zero emission category between Program Years 1 and 2. Accordingly, following the principle of gradualism, the Authority determines that allowing an incremental adjustment to the MW allocation between size categories to increase small zero emission capacity would further the Program Objectives.  Specifically, the Authority approves a portion of the EDCs’ proposed reallocation, resulting in the size categories below for Year 3 as summarized in the below table:  

Table 4: NRES Size Category Allocations   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Category</td><td>Project Size (AC)</td><td>Total MW/ Procurement Year</td><td>Eversource MW/Year</td><td>UI MW/Year</td></tr><tr><td>Low Emission</td><td>≤ 5,000 kW</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Small Zero Emission</td><td>≤200kW</td><td>30</td><td>24</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Medium Zero Emission</td><td>>200 kW < 1,000 kW</td><td>33</td><td>25</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Large Zero Emission</td><td>≥ 1,000 kW ≤5,000kW</td><td>37</td><td>31</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Total Zero Emission</td><td>≤5,000 kW</td><td>100</td><td>80</td><td>20</td></tr></table></body></html>  

However, the Authority concludes that there is insufficient evidence to justify changing the MW allocation between size categories for the next Program year to the extent proposed in the EDCs’ written comments.  The Authority reiterates that the number of bids in the small project category has fluctuated greatly across LREC/ZREC and NRES program years, and notes that the deployment of larger solar projects is an important tool in helping Connecticut cost-effectively achieve a $100\%$ carbon-free electric grid by 2040. Thus, adjusting the MW allocation between size categories incrementally and gathering more data from NRES solicitations is warranted to determine whether a further shift in size categories is in the best interest of achieving the Program Objectives.  Further, such data gathering is necessary to determine whether the strong interest in small NRES projects is a sustained or temporary trend to help inform future size allocation adjustments, particularly as the EDCs’ proposed reallocation would represent a significant change from the current size allocations.  The Authority intends to consider the capacity allocation between size categories further in the subsequent annual Program review.  

Finally, the Authority is open to adjusting the size thresholds to more effectively allocate capacity between size categories and achieve least-cost outcomes, including potentially lowering the size threshold for the small zero emission project category.  The Authority intends to consider this further in the next annual review proceeding and invites stakeholder input and data at such time.  

# D. DISTRESSED MUNICIPALITY BID PREFERENCE  

# 1.    Definition Expansion  

The Authority has previously clarified that environmental justice communities not in Distressed Municipalities do not qualify for the Distressed Municipality bid preference. Motion No. 9 Ruling, Mar. 9, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, p. 3.  Nevertheless, the Authority stated that it would consider an expansion of the distressed municipality bid preference through the annual review process in this proceeding.  Id.  Accordingly, the Authority requested stakeholder feedback on whether to expand distressed municipality bid preference eligibility to include environmental justice census block groups.  Notice, June 1, 2023, p. 4.  The Authority was especially interested in comments on whether the benefits of the proposed change outweigh increased programmatic costs and potential customer confusion.  Id.  

The City of New Haven supported the proposal because it furthered the first Program Objective.  New Haven Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 2-3.  Likewise, DEEP supported an expansion of the Distressed Municipality bid preference definition, as long as the project’s beneficial accounts remain in the environmental justice community. DEEP Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 3.  Additionally, the EDCs stated that the “relevant criteria for Distressed Municipalities and Environmental Justice communities are sufficiently consistent for customers of both” to receive the same bid preference.  EDC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 8.  The EDCs cautioned, however, that an expansion of the bid preference may not necessarily lead to increased benefits for underserved communities, because a Tariff Payment Beneficiary who resides outside the community oftentimes receives $100\%$ of the project’s compensation under the Buy-All Tariff.  Id. Further, TRITEC supported an expansion of the distressed municipality bid preference because both Distressed Municipalities and environmental justice census block groups meet the statutory definition of an environmental justice community.  TRITEC Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 3-4.  TRITEC also noted that both locations have a population where $30\%$ or more of residents have an income level of $200\%$ or less of the federal poverty level.  Id.   Last, Lodestar supported consistency between the state’s clean energy programs and noted that the underserved community definition in the Electric Vehicle Charging Program provides increased incentives to both Distressed Municipalities and environmental justice census block groups.  Lodestar Comments, June 16, 2023, pp. 1- 2.  

Conversely, Allco argued for a clear and stable definition for the distressed municipality bid preference, because project development often crosses bid cycles.  Allco Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 2.  Moreover, while OCC supported increased inclusivity in the NRES Program, it could not weigh the benefits of an expanded bid preference without knowing the expansion’s costs.  OCC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 2.  Finally, Verogy recommended no changes to the Distressed Municipality bid preference definition, because the current definition is easy to understand for Program participants, unlike the proposed expansion, which may cause customer confusion.  Verogy Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 8.  

The Authority declines to expand customer eligibility for the Distressed Municipality bid preference in the NRES Program at this time because the inclusion of environmental justice census block groups in the Distressed Municipality bid preference would likely negatively impact the fourth Program Objective, accessibility for customers through simplified Program and tariff designs, by adding unneeded complexity to the Distressed Municipality bid preference.  Additionally, determination of whether a customer resides in an environmental justice census block group is not as readily available as the current requirements for the Distressed Municipality bid preference, which are based solely on a customer’s town of residence.  Further, the Authority is concerned that an expanded definition for the Distressed Municipality bid preference would negatively impact the third Program Objective, ensuring least-cost outcomes, by increasing programmatic costs through increased bid preference application, including for projects in environmental justice census block groups that may otherwise be incented without a bid preference. Year 2 February solicitation results were also concentrated among Distressed Municipality projects in some categories, thereby suggesting that an expanded definition of the Distressed Municipality bid preference is not needed to increase underserved participation in the Program.  EDC Corresp., June 27, 2023, p. 16.  Ultimately, absent a compelling need to expand the eligibility requirements for the Distressed Municipality bid preference, the Distressed Municipality bid preference shall remain tied to a customer’s town of residence, rather than a customer’s individual census block.  

# 2.    Distressed Municipality Bid Preference Grace Period Allowance  

The Authority requested stakeholder feedback on solutions for circumstances in which a potential NRES project is eligible for the Distressed Municipality bid preference but becomes ineligible before bid submission after an update to the Distressed Municipality list, potentially rendering the project financially unviable.  Notice, June 1, 2023, p. 5.  

In response, DEEP asserted that the current statutory definition of Distressed Municipalities already has a five-year grace period:  

Any municipality which, at any time subsequent to July 1, 1978, has met such thresholds but which at any time thereafter fails to meet such thresholds, according to said department, shall be deemed to be a distressed municipality for a period of five years subsequent to the date of the determination that such municipality fails to meet such thresholds, unless such municipality elects to terminate its designation.  

Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S32–9p(\mathsf{b})$ ; DEEP Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 2-3.  

Consequently, DEEP opined that the current definition gives developers “sufficient notice of when the municipality will no longer hold the “Distressed Municipality” designation.”  Id., p. 3.  The City of New Haven also highlighted the statutory definition of a Distressed Municipality and advocated for a five-year grace period in the NRES Program.  New Haven Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 1-2.  Additionally, New Haven noted that the Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD) is currently following the statutory definition.  Id.  Similarly, TRITEC argued for a five-year grace period for Distressed Municipality bid preference qualification, equal to statute, to give solar developers and investors greater certainty.  TRITEC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 4.  Conversely, in support of the first and fifth Program Objectives, Verogy supported a one-year grace period for Distressed Municipality bid preference eligibility.  Verogy Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 8-9.  Finally, although the EDCs did not oppose a grace period for Distressed Municipality bid preference qualification, the EDCs argued that the Authority should consider whether the “Distressed Municipality bid preference is producing intended benefits for customers and communities before expanding the number of communities that qualify for the preference.”  EDC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 10.  

The Authority concludes that the current statutory definition of a Distressed Municipality, which includes a five-year grace period already, provides sufficient notice for developers of future changes to project eligibility for the Distressed Municipality adder, thereby supporting the first, fourth, and fifth Program Objectives.  Notably, DECD follows the statutory definition in the list published on its website, which is then used by the EDCs to determine whether a project qualifies for the Distressed Municipality bid preference.14 EDC Compliance, Mar. 13, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, Attachment 2a, p. 4.  Finally, the Authority clarifies that a project will be eligible for the Distressed Municipality bid preference provided the project’s municipality is on the Distressed Municipality list when the project’s application is selected by the EDCs.  

# 3.    SAM Beneficial Account Location  

In the Year 2 Decision, the NRES Program was updated to only allow the Distressed Municipality bid preference in cases where $100\%$ of a project’s beneficial accounts are located within a Distressed Municipality, to ensure the benefits of a SAM project are flowing to Distressed Municipalities.  Year 2 Decision, p. 16.  The Authority nevertheless sought stakeholder input on whether to expand this requirement to be more inclusive of circumstances not raised during last year’s proceeding, including cases where a beneficial account is “located in or on land otherwise in possession of [D]istressed [M]unicipalities where the electric service to the beneficial account is paid for by the [D]istressed [M]unicipality.”  Notice, July 21, 2023, pp. 1-2.  

The EDCs stated that expanding the current Distressed Municipality eligibility requirements are unnecessary as the circumstance described in the Authority’s Notice of Request for Written Comments has only occurred once.  EDC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 2.  If the definition were expanded to include cases where a beneficial account is located on land owned by a Distressed Municipality and where the Distressed Municipality pays for the land’s electric service, the EDCs believed that “bidders should be required to submit definitive documentation proving that is the case for every [D]istressed [M]unicipality beneficial account at the time of bid submission,” potentially inclusive of 1,000 accounts.  Id., pp. 2-3.  The EDCs also argued that all SAM projects seeking the Distressed Municipality bid preference be physically located in a Distressed Municipality. Id., p. 3.  Alternatively, OCC did not object to changes to SAM Distressed Municipality bid preference eligibility requirements, so long as project benefits go to the beneficial accounts owned by Distressed Municipalities.  OCC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 2. Amending the requirements of the Distressed Municipality bid preference “seems a logical extension of the program guidelines to … expand program participat[ion] in underserved economically disadvantaged or environmental justice communities.”  Id.  

Lodestar supported updating the Distressed Municipality bid preference to “be applicable when $100\%$ of the beneficial accounts are located in or on land otherwise in possession of” Distressed Municipalities who also pay for the electric service of the beneficial account.  Lodestar Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 1.  Additionally, TRITEC noted that Distressed Municipalities may own water-treatment facilities in other municipalities, because the siting requirements for water-treatment facilities are not present in all Distressed Municipalities.  TRITEC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 2.  Last, Verogy supported the expansion of SAM projects eligible for the Distressed Municipality bid preference to include the circumstance described in the Authority’s Notice of Request for Written Comments.  Verogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 1.  Verogy claimed that the geographic locations of beneficial accounts are somewhat arbitrary.  Id., p. 2.  Moreover, an expansion of the eligibility requirements for the Distressed Municipality bid preference would advance the fourth and fifth Program Objectives, Verogy believed.  Id.  

For Distressed Municipality bid preference eligibility, the Authority will allow SAM projects where a Distressed Municipality owns the beneficial accounts and the Distressed Municipality is paying for the beneficial accounts’ electric service.  The Authority concludes that this change to the Program requirements will further the fifth Program Objective, increased inclusivity overall, because the ratepayers of the Distressed Municipality will directly benefit from such change, since the beneficial account is ultimately owned by the residents of a Distressed Municipality.  Further, this change allows water treatment plants or other waste facilities that may be unable to be sited in a distressed municipality to participate in the NRES Program and receive the Distressed Municipality bid preference, where under the existing Program rules they are prohibited from inclusion in the Distressed Municipality bid preference, even when such facilities are owned by a Distressed Municipality, to the detriment of the fifth Program Objective.  SAM applicants must, however, provide evidence to the EDCs that a beneficial account not located in a Distressed Municipality is owned by a Distressed Municipality and has an electric account that is paid for by a Distressed Municipality.  A non-exhaustive list of such evidence includes electric bills for a beneficial account not located in a Distressed Municipality showing that a Distressed Municipality pays for the account’s electricity, deeds or titles for the land that the beneficial account is on proving Distressed Municipality ownership, or lease agreements or options signed by a Distressed Municipality, as described in Section IV.F.1.  This change will impact only a small number of project applications because the EDCs will only need to collect and verify such information for beneficial accounts that are not already physically located in a Distressed Municipality, and solely if the project is applying for the Distressed Municipality bid preference.  The EDCs shall update the Program Manual to include the above direction.  The Authority looks forward to increased Distressed Municipality involvement in the NRES Program.  

# 4.    Distressed Municipality Project Benefits  

The Authority aims to ensure that the benefits of the Distressed Municipality bid preference are flowing to Distressed Municipalities, in accordance with the fifth Program Objective, increased inclusivity overall.  Additionally, Eversource stated that “the bid data that is available … does not indicate that the Distressed Municipalities are directly benefiting from [the Distressed Municipality] bid preference in all cases.”  Tech Mt’g Tr., June 21, 2023, 81:3-6.  More specifically, in Eversource service territory, a majority of February Year 2 Distressed Municipality bids allocated $100\%$ of quarterly payments to a third party.  EDC Corresp., June 19, 2023, p. 18.  The Authority consequently requested written comments “on how to ensure NRES project benefits are flowing to [D]istressed [M]unicipalities, including, but not limited to, discussion on what documentation or data could be filed for each project by developers.”  Notice, July 21, 2023, p. 2.  

Accordingly, Ecogy agreed with the Authority that SAM projects “be required to prove that the solar energy savings beneficiaries are located within a Distressed Municipality.”  Ecogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 2.  Ecogy noted that projects located in Distressed Municipalities increase energy resilience, potentially displace fossil fuel generation, and support local clean energy jobs and training.  Id.  Nevertheless, Ecogy opposed requiring that a set percentage of the project benefit flow to Distressed Municipalities, because “associated documentation requirements increase costs and cause administrative burden.”  Id.  Moreover, ConnSSA argued that quantifying project benefits that go to Distressed Municipalities is difficult to do, especially for solar leases where the beneficial accounts are not receiving any direct benefits.  ConnSSA Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 2.  Verogy suggested that lease agreements, bill credit splits, or tax agreements serve as sufficient proof that a Distressed Municipality is receiving NRES project benefits.  Verogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 2.  Verogy was also willing to share confidential data with the Authority on benefits NRES projects provide to Distressed Municipalities.  Id.  However, Verogy stated that a prescriptive benefit sharing requirement would be arbitrary and would add complexity to project development. Id., p. 3.  Verogy further stated that Distressed Municipalities and project owners should be able to “independently negotiate the amount of shared benefits,” to maintain project flexibility and to support the Program Objectives.  Id.  

TRITEC further noted that its contracts with Distressed Municipalities provide “substantial monetary benefit” to said communities and are approved by the Distressed Municipality’s governing body.  TRITEC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 4.  TRITEC also noted a belief that the benefits of solar projects offered to Distressed Municipalities were subject to market forces, including via competitive Requests for Proposals (RFPs), thereby providing “the highest benefits economically feasible” to said municipalities.  Id. Consequently, TRITEC did not support methodologies for determining the percentage project benefit that must be passed to a Distressed Municipality.  Id., p. 5.  If the Authority wanted to verify that project benefits are flowing to Distressed Municipalities, however, TRITEC recommended that “the Authority consider requiring the project developers to submit the beneficial account agreements to the Authority subject to a protective order.” Id.  Similarly, Lodestar did not support minimum project benefit sharing requirements with Distressed Municipalities, because project economics vary.  Lodestar Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 3.  Lodestar also noted that projects provide benefits to Distressed Municipalities via taxes and/or lease payments.  Id.  Nonetheless, Lodestar noted that tax rates or lease terms may be used to verify Distressed Municipality project benefits.  Id.  

Further, OCC stated that the Authority should continue to require $100\%$ of a project’s beneficial accounts to be located in a Distressed Municipality in order to qualify for the Distressed Municipality bid preference.  OCC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 3. Projects receiving the Distressed Municipality bid preference should also be required to send $100\%$ of the benefits created by the Distressed Municipality bid preference to Distressed Municipality residents, OCC noted, to advance the Program Objectives.  Id. OCC also argued the “[d]evelopers should be required to quantify how they will apportion project benefits [to Distressed Municipalities] at the time that they apply for approval.”  Id. Finally, the EDCs supported “a minimum percentage of NRES project benefits be required to be passed” on to Distressed Municipalities.  EDC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 5.  The EDCs argued that projects could be required to allocate a minimum percentage of project benefits to Distressed Municipalities via the Program’s credit allocation form.  Id., p. 5. The EDCs recommended that the minimum benefit sharing percentage be set at $20\%$ of a system’s total financial benefit, because this is the standard that is used in the Residential Renewable Energy Solutions (RRES) Program for multifamily affordable housing.  Id.  The EDCs also noted that the RRES Program assumed that system owners require $60\%$ of the tariff’s value to cover system operation costs, and that splitting the remaining $40\%$ of project benefits between tenants and property owners would ensure equity.  Id.  Ultimately, the minimum benefit sharing percentage could be reevaluated for the NRES Program, the EDCs believed, as actual cost data becomes available.  Id.  

The Authority will not mandate a set percentage of NRES project benefits flow to Distressed Municipalities at this time as the Authority requires additional data before making any such determination and has further questions regarding how such requirements would be monitored and enforced.  Furthermore, Distressed Municipalities often choose projects through a competitive process and/or go through municipal approval processes, which ensure the Distressed Municipalities are aware of the benefits the municipality will receive under a particular solar agreement.  

Nevertheless, based on the data presented by the EDCs, the Authority concludes that additional consumer protections are needed now to ensure that Distressed Municipalities are not subject to deceptive marketing practices or solar agreements. Consequently, the EDCs shall file as compliance with the Authority by December 15, 2023, a Consumer Protection and Disclosure Form, for use beginning in the Year 3 August solicitation.  The Consumer Protection and Disclosure Form may be modeled after the existing forms used for the RRES Program.  See EDC Compliance, Jan. 27, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-02, Attachments 7 and 8.  Notably, the Consumer Protection and Disclosure Form used for the RRES Program requires developers to estimate year one net customer savings or estimated net average monthly savings, thereby protecting underserved customers from signing agreements that would provide little or no monetary savings.  For the purposes of the NRES Program, the net customer savings calculation may include a project’s expected property tax benefits, in addition to other financial benefits such as lease payments.  Last, as all NRES customers, especially small businesses, would benefit from a Consumer Protection and Disclosure Form, the Authority shall require it for all NRES bids.  To give developers enough time to adjust to this new documentation requirement, the Consumer Protection and Disclosure Form shall first be required in the Year 3 August solicitation.   This change will advance the Program Objectives, particularly the fourth Program Objective, program accessibility for customers, by requiring project data to be disclosed upfront to the customer.  

Finally, using the information provided by the Consumer Protection and Disclosure Form, the Authority requires the EDCs to track net customer savings for all Distressed Municipality projects moving forward so that the Authority can better monitor the financial benefits the NRES program provides to underserved communities.  The Authority intends to consider including aggregated monthly project size and savings data on the PURA Data Dashboard, as established pursuant to the Decision dated April 20, 2022 in Docket No. 21-07-01, Application of The Connecticut Light and Power Company and Yankee Gas Services Company, each Individually d/b/a Eversource Energy, The United Illuminating Company, Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation, and The Southern Connecticut Gas Company for Approval of Arrearage Forgiveness Program 2021-2022, in the next annual review process in Docket No. 24-08-03.  Similarly, the Authority intends to gather stakeholder feedback on updating the Consumer Protection and Disclosure Form annually to include average project size and savings information in the next annual review proceeding, i.e., Docket No. 24-08-03.  

# E. CARPORT AND/OR SOLAR CANOPY BID PREFERENCE  

# 1. Solar Canopy Definition  

In Docket No. 23-08-04, Annual Shared Clean Energy Facility Program Review – Year 5, the EDCs proposed a new solar canopy definition for use across both the SCEF and NRES Programs.15  See EDC Interrog. Resp. CAE-1, Docket No. 23-08-04, p. 2.  The Authority adopts with modification the EDCs’ proposed solar canopy definition for use in the NRES Program, to ensure consistency between the NRES and SCEF Programs. More specifically, the Authority adopts the following solar canopy definition for use in the NRES Program:  

‘Solar Canopy’ or ‘Solar Canopies’ or ‘Solar Carport’ shall mean a solar generation Project where with at least 75% of the alternating current (AC) Nameplate Capacity of a Project used for generating power is installed above a permeable and/or nonpermeable existing or new parking/driving area, pedestrian walkway, courtyard, canal, or other utilized surface that requires shade, which is installed in a manner that maintains the function of the area beneath the structure and continues to be used or available for use for such purposes for the term of Program participation.  

The Authority had clarified that hybrid projects, consisting of both solar canopies and rooftop solar, may qualify for a portion of the solar canopy bid preference based on the project’s total percent capacity, in kW AC, which is located on a solar canopy (e.g., if $25\%$ of a hybrid projects capacity is located on a canopy, the project shall receive $25\%$ of the $30\%$ solar canopy bid preference, or a $7.5\%$ bid preference).  Year 2 Decision, p. 18. Consequently, while the EDCs’ proposed solar canopy definition would require at least $75\%$ of a project’s nameplate capacity to be located above a surface to qualify as a solar canopy, the Authority determines that this condition is not needed in the solar canopy/carport definition, due to the allowance of hybrid projects and in the absence of solar canopy Program participation.  The Authority will reevaluate the solar canopy definition that is currently used in the SCEF Program in Docket No. 23-08-04, to align the NRES and SCEF solar canopy definitions to the fullest extent possible.  The Authority concludes that an alignment of the NRES and SCEF solar canopy definitions will reduce developer confusion, thereby furthering the fourth Program Objective, program accessibility through simplified program designs.  

# 2. Bid Preference Amount  

In the Year 2 Decision, the Authority instituted a $20\%$ bid preference for solar canopies and/or carports to further the first, second, and fifth Program Objectives, to encourage the preservation of greenspaces, and to support consistency between the SCEF and NRES Programs, since the SCEF Program also has a solar canopy bid preference.  Year 2 Decision, p. 18.  However, the Authority also recognized that a solar canopy bid preference would not further the third Program Objective, ensuring least-cost outcomes, since bid preferences sometimes result in the prioritization of higher cost projects.  Id.  Accordingly, the Authority stated its intention to analyze the costs and benefits of the solar canopy/carport bid preference, to see if changes would be warranted in future Program reviews.  Id.  Further, the Authority clarified that “[s]ubstantial evidence, including detailed substantiation and documentation of any such data and analysis, must be provided … for the Authority to make a determination to increase the solar canopy and/or carport bid preference.”  Id.  

Several stakeholders favored increasing the current NRES solar canopy/carport bid preference.  For example, Independence Solar argued for a $40\%$ bid preference, citing strict siting requirements on greenspaces and forests, visual impacts, the promotion of beneficial land use, and a lack of current solar canopy/carport development. Independence Solar Corresp., June 15, 2023, p. 1.  ConnSSA also noted that no solar canopies/carports have yet been submitted to the Program and highlighted the environmental benefits of such projects.  ConnSSA Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 5. Further, ConnSSA noted a report by the People’s Action for Clean Energy (PACE), which found that “there are 8,416 potentially viable carport/canopy sites across Connecticut” with a combined capacity of 7,021 MW.  Id., p. 6.  

Additionally, DEEP argued that the NRES solar canopy/carport bid preference should be increased to $30\%$ to match the number used in the SCEF Program, which is also similar to the value used in the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) Program.  DEEP Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 4.  Moreover, the EDCs noted that solar canopies do not detract from a site’s intended use, maintain greenspaces, and are more likely to add generation to areas where there is existing customer load, thereby potentially minimizing interconnection costs.  EDC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 11.  Ultimately, the EDCs supported bid preference alignment across the SCEF and NRES Programs wherever possible.  Id.  Last, HyAxiom advocated for the bid preference to be “based on the amount of space the project covers.”  HyAxiom Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 5.  

The Authority determines that an increase in the solar canopy/carport bid preference is warranted to further the first and third Program Objectives by fostering the sustained and orderly development of the state’s Class I renewable energy industry, and by ensuring program accessibility for customers through a simplified tariff design.  More specifically, in line with the comments provided by stakeholders, the Authority directs the EDCs to raise the NRES solar canopy/carport bid preference to match the value used in the SCEF Program (i.e., $30\%$ ).  Decision, Dec. 7, 2022, Docket No. 22-08-04, Annual Shared Clean Energy Facility Program Review – Year 4, p. 15.  Additionally, a $30\%$ NRES solar canopy/carport bid preference will ensure consistency between the SCEF and NRES Programs while furthering state preservation goals through the protection of greenspaces.  Moreover, as discussed in Section IV.B.5., solar canopy projects will be allowed to bid above the price cap, so long as the final bid price inclusive of the $30\%$ bid preference does not exceed the Program price cap (i.e., large zero emission Buy-All solar canopy projects may bid up to $\$182.46/\mathsf{M W}$ h and still be eligible for Program participation).  The Authority clarifies, however, that small zero emission projects will not be eligible for the solar canopy/carport bid preference, or to bid above the price cap, so that the guidelines for the new bid preference will remain consistent with the existing bid preferences.  

# F. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS  

# 1. Proof of Site Control  

The required proof of site control documentation has been raised on several occasions by docket Participants, particularly for SAM projects participating in virtual net metering (VNM).  See Motion No. 23, Feb. 2, 2022, Docket No. 21-08-03; Motion No. 9, Jan. 30, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03; EDC Compliance, March 13, 2023, Docket No. 22- 08-03, Attachment 2b, p. 10.  In the Year 1 Decision, the Authority decided that the bid certification form “is sufficient for purposes of bid submission and review” when determining site control, but also required additional documentation proving site control be made available in the event of an audit.  Year 1 Decision, p. 11.  Subsequently, in a ruling to Motion No. 23 in Docket No. 21-08-03, the Authority reiterated that:  

[T]he Non-Residential Tariff Decision clarified that each SAM account acting as a customer host wishing to engage in VNM must demonstrate ownership of the project site, as demonstrated by Proof of Site Control, though the project would not be required to be directly tied to beneficial account meters.  [Non-Residential Tariff Decision, pp. 38-39].  The Authority reiterated that the SAM customer must own the project site in its Decision dated November 3, 2021 in Docket No. 21-08-03.  

Motion No. 23 Ruling, Feb. 16, 2022, Docket No. 21-08-03, p. 2 (emphasis added). However, on several occasions, the Authority indicated that it would support legislation clarifying the intent of such language, because the Authority understood the barrier that requiring SAM customers to own the land on which a VNM project is located imposed.  

Section 25 of Public Act 23-102, signed into law on June 29, 2023, and effective October 1, 2023, exempts SAM projects from needing to be located on a site owned by the customer.  Consequently, the Authority requested written comments from stakeholders on “what documents should be considered suitable for proof of site control, including but not limited to, written leases, options to lease, memoranda of lease, options of memorandum to lease, and contracts to purchase.”  Notice, July 21, 2023, p. 3.  

Ecogy stated that, in order to bid into Rhode Island’s Renewable Energy Growth (REG) Program, “developers only need to show proof of site control in the form of a lease agreement.”  Ecogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 2.  Conversely, the NRES Program requires significant paperwork for bids, including forms requiring input from the billing customer, which is not as involved in the bidding process.  Id.  Accordingly, Ecogy believed that all customers, including SAM projects, should be required to submit only the following documentation to prove site control: (1) a notarized or signed option or lease; or (2) a notarized or signed power purchase agreement.  Id., p. 3.  Ecogy also noted that current Program requirements prevent property owners from developing NRES projects if a long-term tenant is in control of the utility bill, since the customer of record is not the site owner or project developer in such cases.  Id.  Further, Verogy and TRITEC agreed that NRES projects with SAM beneficial accounts should be required to provide site control documents including but not limited to, written leases, options to lease, memoranda of lease, options of memorandum to lease, and contracts to purchase land. Verogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 4; TRITEC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 5.  

Additionally, OCC believes that the Authority “must allow [SAM] projects to proceed on properties not owned by the applicant.”  OCC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 5.  For proof of site control, OCC argued that the Authority should require written documentation showing that the developer has a “long-term property interest” in the project site, including “[d]eeds, options to purchase, executed contracts to purchase property … purchase contracts contingent upon project approval” or lease agreements with provisions for long-term tenancy (i.e., for the life of the solar system).  Id., pp. 5-6. All such documents, moreover, must include a legal right to access the project site, OCC argued.  Id.  Finally, the EDCs proposed “to eliminate the requirement for all bidders to provide additional proof of site control,” because the EDCs believed that the “Bid Certification Form and the affidavit of Owner of the Project Site’s Notarized Signature, Commitment, and Acceptance” provide valid proof of site control, in addition to legislative changes.  EDC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 6.  

The Authority determines that for bids where the SAM host account is not the owner of the project site, such bidder must demonstrate site control by providing relevant documentation to the EDCs.  More specifically, for bid evaluation purposes, the Authority will require the EDCs to collect a bid certification form and an affidavit signed by the site owner in cases where the SAM host account does not own the project site.16  The affidavit signed by the site owner shall state that the bidder (i.e., SAM customer host account): (1) has control of the project site or an unconditional right to obtain site control; (2) is authorized to submit a NRES bid on the project site; and 3) is authorized to participate in the NRES Program for the entire 20-year tariff term should the bid be selected.  Moreover, the EDCs must collect, for auditing purposes, the following additional documents proving site control in cases where the SAM bidder does not own the project site, including but not limited to, written leases, options to lease, memoranda of lease, options of memorandum to lease, and contracts to purchase.  

The Authority clarifies that, consistent with the Year 1 Decision, the validation of any additional documents, such as leases, options to lease, etc., shall not form the basis of bid submission review.  However, if the EDCs determine that the bidder does not have control of the project site, or an unconditional right granted by the property owner to acquire such control by the start of the tariff term, at any point during the solicitation process or tariff term, the bidder may be removed from the Program and the bidder’s tariff may be terminated by the EDCs.  The EDCs shall amend the Program Manual language to clarify existing and new site control requirements.  The EDCs shall not, however, remove all references to the additional documents required for site control validation, as is the case in the EDCs’ current proposed Year 3 Program Manual, because the EDCs are required to collect such documents in the event of an audit.  See EDC Order No. 21 Compliance, Attachment 1b, pp. 16, 19; Year 1 Decision, p. 11.  The Authority concludes that these changes adequately address the intent of Public Act 23-102 by allowing SAM project participation in cases where a SAM customer does not own the project site. Additionally, the Authority concludes that these changes are in the interest of the Program Objectives, by expanding the number of SAM customers who can participate in the Program, and by establishing accessible application criteria for bid evaluations in cases where a SAM customer does not own the NRES project site.  

Finally, the EDCs clarified that:  

any entity with site control for a given project site [is] the Customer of Record [and the EDCs] have historically allowed those participating in the Buy-All Tariff to combine a set of multiple existing meters located on the same Project Site to determine the total eligible site load for a potential Project. Thus, property owners have historically been allowed to develop NRES projects independent of long-term tenant(s) by submitting a new construction buy-all bid.  

Eversource Exceptions, Nov. 1, 2023, p. 5; UI Exceptions, Nov. 1, 2023, p. 6.  

The Authority concludes that the EDCs’ above clarification resolves the scenario Ecogy described, where a property owner seeking to participate in the NRES Program does not have control of a proposed project site’s utility account for billing purposes.  To make current programmatic requirements clearer to all stakeholders, and to support the fourth Program Objective, program accessibility for customers through simplified program designs, the Authority directs the EDCs to clarify directly in the Program Manual that: (1) any entity with site control can be the Customer of Record; (2) property owners can combine a set of multiple existing meters at the same project site to determine the site’s historical load; and (3) property owners with long-term tenants in control of a site’s utility account may still participate in the Program by submitting a new construction Buy-All bid.  

# 2.  State Project Contracting Requirements  

The Connecticut Green Bank (CGB) brought to the Authority's attention that State Customers are unable to execute the NRES Tariff Agreement, as written; effectively preventing State projects from participating in the NRES Program.  Motion No. 13, June 8, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, pp. 2-3.  CGB stated that this specific issue was not a barrier to State Customer participation in the predecessor program to NRES, LREC/ZREC, because that program allowed the developer to sign the agreement as the counterparty on behalf of the State Customer.  Motion No. 13, June 8, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, p. 4.  In response to subsequent interrogatory prompts from the Authority issued July 7, 2023, CGB further clarified that allowing the project Developer to act as Counterparty to the Tariff Agreement in place of the State Agency would alleviate the contracting issues for State facilities in the NRES Program.  CGB Interrog. Resp. CAE14, Docket No. 22-08-03.  Similarly, Eversource stated that allowing the Developer to sign the Tariff Agreement would be an acceptable solution as the Developer in question had previously executed standard LREC/ZREC agreements without modification on behalf of a State Customer, although such a change would require waiving certain Program Manual rules in this limited instance.  Eversource Interrog. Resp. CAE-17, Docket No. 22-08-03.  

The inability for State entities to execute the NRES Tariff Agreement is inconsistent with Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S16{-}244z(a)(4$ ), which explicitly allows SAM facilities to participate in the NRES Program, as well as the Program Objectives, particularly the first and third Program Objectives.  Accordingly, on July 26, 2023, the Authority granted Motion No. 13 in part (Motion No. 13 Ruling 2), authorizing CGB and Eversource to modify the Tariff Agreement language to allow the Developer to enter into the Agreement as the Counterparty.  Motion No. 13 Ruling 2, July 26, 2023, p. 3.  Further, the Authority directed CGB and Eversource to file the modified Tariff Agreement as compliance in this annual review proceeding, Docket No. 23-08-03, so PURA and stakeholders could consider potential permanent tariff modifications to ensure State entity participation in the NRES Program.  Id.  

On September 13, 2023, Eversource submitted compliance with Motion No. 13 Ruling 2, including clean and redlined versions of the revised Tariff Agreement with the Developer as the Counterparty.  Eversource Compliance, Sept. 13, 2023.  The modifications to the Tariff Agreement specify that the Customer is the Developer, while the Customer of Record is the State customer.  Id.  Consequently, the Authority determines that the redline changes to the Tariff Agreement submitted in compliance with Motion No. 13 Ruling 2 shall serve as a model for all State customers seeking participation in the NRES Program.  Expressly, to remove the barrier for State entities to participate in the Program, the EDCs shall allow developers to execute the revised Tariff Agreement on behalf of State customers, and only State customers, for the duration of the Program.  

# G. OVERSIZED ROOFTOP SYSTEMS  

# 1. Buy-All Cash Out Policy  

The Authority requested comments on the NRES Program Buy-All cash-out policy to ensure that the policy was suitable for oversized rooftop systems, which were allowed with the passage of Public Act No. 22-14.  Notice, June 1, 2023, p. 6.  In the Year 2 Decision, the Authority determined that it was appropriate to allow “oversized rooftop systems to [participate] only under the Buy-All tariff” at that time.  Year 2 Decision, p. 22. Section 4.4.1.1 of the Program Manual currently states that monetary on-bill credits under the Buy-All tariff “roll over until the end of the 20-year term,” upon which the customer would receive a monetary cash payment in excess of the amount listed on their electric bill.  EDC Compliance, Mar. 13, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, Attachment 2a, p. 19. Consequently, the structure might lead to a buildup of excess on-bill credits over the entire length of the 20-year tariff term given that oversized systems by definition exceed the load of the host site.  

Verogy argued that should customers receive monetary on-bill credits under the Buy-All tariff, excess credits should be paid out in the form of a direct cash payment on a quarterly basis instead of at the end of the 20-year tariff term to advance the Program Objectives.  Verogy Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 9-10.  Further, Verogy stated that the current Buy-All payment structure dissuades customers from oversizing their rooftop system.  Id.  Similarly, in written comments, ConnSSA argued for excess Buy-All credits to be paid out on a quarterly basis, similar to Netting tariff REC payments.  ConnSSA Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 6.  ConnSSA also asserted that the EDCs have the ability to make both quarterly Buy-All cash payments and apply on-bill credits, as is currently done under the Netting tariff with REC payments.  Id., p. 7.  Last, ConnSSA asserted that without changes to the Buy-All on-bill payment structure, “there could be a significant build-up of excess bill credits over time.”  Id.  

The EDCs, in written comments, argued that current Buy-All payment policies support the development of NRES projects, since customers can “designate any [payment] percentage as on-bill credits versus quarterly payments at any point throughout the duration of the 20-year tariff term,” and since the majority of Buy-All rooftop bids “allocated $100\%$ of payments to a Tariff Payment Beneficiary with no on-bill credits.”  EDC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 12.  The EDCs added further context to their argument by stating that only two Buy-All rooftop bids chose on-bill credits in the Year 2 February solicitation across both EDCs.  Id., pp. 12-13.  

In weighing stakeholder comments, the Authority concludes that the current BuyAll tariff payment structure is suitable for oversized rooftop systems because the Host Customer can specify quarterly cash payment amounts or on-bill credit percentages at any point during the tariff term.  Consequently, the Authority finds that there is a clear remedy to the potential for excess on-bill credits to build-up over the 20-year tariff term. Nevertheless, to ensure this option is clearer to Program participants, the Authority directs the EDCs to include such language more explicitly in Section 4.4.1 of the revised Program Manual to be filed in compliance with this Decision.  

# 2. Netting Tariff Oversizing Allowance  

As noted in the prior section, the Authority only allowed oversized NRES rooftop systems to bid under the Buy-All tariff in the Year 2 Decision.  The Authority made this determination because the record in last year’s annual review proceeding, Docket No. 22-08-03, was unclear as to whether the Program Objectives would be advanced by the allowance of oversized Netting rooftop systems in the Program.  Year 2 Decision, p. 22. The Authority was especially concerned that oversized Netting rooftop systems would “decrease the cost effectiveness of the NRES Program at large, because of the creation of inefficiencies and administrative challenges.”  Id.  Consequently, the Authority directed the EDCs to file specific cost estimates for allowing oversized Netting rooftop systems in the NRES Program, so that the Authority could better understand the effects of oversized Netting rooftop systems on the NRES Program Objectives.  Id.  

The EDCs stated that their “systems are capable of making cash-out payments to customers participating in the Netting tariff and further modifications would not be required.”  EDC Order No. 20 Compliance, June 30, 2023, p. 2.  However, the EDCs asserted that the Buy-All tariff was “the most administratively efficient means of enabling program accessibility and encouraging increased inclusivity” by allowing payments to be divided among on-bill credits and quarterly payments amongst multiple parties, in contrast to the Netting tariff.  Id., p. 1.  Further, the EDCs argued that allowing oversized rooftop systems under the Netting tariff for the small zero emission project category would hinder the NRES Program’s success by preventing least-cost outcomes, since several rate classes would have significantly higher compensation (e.g., more than a million dollars per year for an example 2 MW project) under the Netting tariff when compared to the BuyAll tariff.  Id., pp. 1-2.  Finally, the EDCs noted that the Netting tariff was designed based on initial statutory language that required projects to be sized to load.  Id., p. 2.  Thus, the EDCs argued that indexing projects to the retail rate may not be appropriate for projects that are not serving load.  Id.  

The Authority requested written comments on the EDCs’ compliance filing, including whether oversizing Netting rooftop systems should be permitted in the NRES Program.  Notice, July 21, 2023, p. 4.  Accordingly, Verogy supported allowing oversized Netting rooftop systems in the Program, to better align the Program with Public Act No. 22-14, and because the EDCs can currently make cash-out payments to Netting customers.  Verogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, pp. 6-7.  Verogy also disagreed that allowing oversized Netting rooftop systems would hinder least-cost outcomes, because the Netting and Buy-All incentives are designed to be equal.  Id., p. 6.  Verogy further noted that if the retail cost of electricity decreased, the Netting tariff would cost less than the Buy-All tariff.  Id.  Independence Solar agreed with Verogy that oversized Netting rooftop systems should be permitted in the Program.  Independence Solar Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 1.  Moreover, Independence Solar argued that demand charges increasingly make up a large portion of a customer’s electric bill, which can be offset through system oversizing.  Id.  If the Authority wants to limit oversized Netting rooftop systems, however, Independence Solar recommended that the Authority establish “an oversizing limit of 2.5 times the existing load.”  Id.  

Conversely, DEEP opined that the ratepayer benefits of allowing oversized Netting projects are unclear.  DEEP Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 3.  DEEP noted that “[o]versizing a system for a payout is also inconsistent with the concept of netting, which assumes you have some proportionate load to net against.”  Id.  Customers with oversized Netting projects are therefore selling energy instead of netting it, DEEP asserted.  Id.  If oversized Netting projects were allowed, DEEP encouraged any payments to align with existing payments in the Program, where the customer is selling power in excess of site load.  Id.  

Ultimately, no stakeholders provided evidence that clearly justifies why or demonstrates how allowing oversized rooftop systems to take service under the Netting tariff would further the Program Objectives.  Moreover, the Authority is concerned about the negative impact of allowing oversized Netting rooftop systems in the small zero emission category on the third Program Objective, ensuring least-cost outcomes, as such projects receive significantly greater compensation under certain retail tariffs.  Further, the Netting tariff was originally created to provide on-bill incentives that would match the expected load of a project site.  Allowing oversized Netting systems is inconsistent with the intention and design of the Netting tariff since generation in excess of site load would occur by design if a system were oversized.  Additionally, as Buy-All and Netting bids are compared on an equivalent basis under the competitive project categories, not allowing oversized rooftop systems to take service under the Netting tariffs should have no impact on overall NRES project deployment (i.e., the same compensation is available to projects under the Buy-All tariff as under the Netting tariff).  Based on the foregoing, the Authority declines to allow oversized rooftop systems to take service under the NRES Program’s Netting tariff.  Finally, under the current Program Manual, all NRES projects are permitted to size systems to include future load associated with transportation electrification or fuel switching, and New Construction projects can size systems according to anticipated load with the submission of a Connecticut Licensed Professional Engineer Certification.  EDC Compliance, March 13, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, Attachment 2b, pp. 14-15. Consequently, the Authority clarifies that these existing project size-to-load exceptions shall remain in place for all projects, including Netting bids.  

# H. INTERCONNECTION  

The NRES Program’s predecessor, the LREC/ZREC program, exhibited a high attrition rate.  PURA Corresp., July 27, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, p. 1.  Further, two motions were filed in Docket No. 22-08-03 in calendar year 2023 requesting Authority action to remedy problems associated with Eversource’s interconnection process for NRES projects.17  Consequently, to mitigate project attrition and to foster the sustained development of the state’s Class I solar industry by lowering interconnection barriers, the Authority requested written comments on the interconnection process for NRES projects, including regarding the main drivers of interconnection issues and any problems associated with NRES interconnection configurations thus far.  Notice, June 1, 2023, pp. 7-8.  

In response, Independence Solar argued that “[i]nterconnection remains one of the largest barriers CT faces.”  Independence Solar Corresp., June 15, 2023, p. 2. Independence Solar specifically pointed to recent motions where the EDCs have disallowed interconnection configurations that are National Electrical Code (NEC) compliant.  Id.  Further, Independence Solar noted that Buy-All systems are currently being counted as loads instead of sources in the interconnection process, thereby double counting project site load and driving up Buy-All project costs in opposition to the Program Objectives.  Id.  Moreover, TRITEC provided a list of projects that have had interconnection applications delayed for unknown reasons beyond the timeline given by the utility.  Id.  TRITEC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 6.  

Verogy highlighted two main issues with NRES interconnection processes: (1) the issuance of interconnection approval, which is later contradicted by other departments within the utility, most notably via an interpretation that Buy-All projects be counted as load adders; and (2) the need for detailed and descriptive NRES metering guidelines to remove the risk for broad interconnection interpretations by the utility.  Verogy Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 12-13.  For example, Verogy claimed that the utility required the installation of additional equipment not in the service manual after submitted design drawings had already been approved by another utility department.  Id., 13.  To advance the first, third, and fourth Program Objectives, Verogy recommended that the utility review metering guidelines in consultation with all utility departments via a solar working group with project developers.  Id., p. 14.  

The EDCs highlighted the risk of higher project attrition, noting that interconnection costs are only expected to continue to increase, to the detriment of the Program Objectives.  EDC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 14.  The EDCs also noted the importance of deterring speculative bids by ensuring bidders have conducted due diligence on estimated interconnection costs for their proposed project.  Id., p. 15.  Ultimately, the EDCs recommended the Authority require the completion of an interconnection application and Feasibility Study prior to bid submission in the medium and large categories, with an exception for projects that propose to “connect to a substation with listed hosting capacity sufficient for the project.”  Id., p. 16.  

Subsequently, in response to the EDCs’ compliance with Motion No. 12 in Docket No. 22-08-03,18 ConnSSA argued for a consolidation of interconnection approval processes for NRES projects.  EDC Compliance, Aug. 16, 2023, Attachment A, p. 5. ConnSSA requested that the Authority consider requiring the EDCs to provide a single point of contact for interconnection applications to coordinate and track all EDC interconnection approvals across the multiple departments involved.  Id.  ConnSSA noted that EDC departments often provide contradictory information to applicants during the interconnection approval process, which can create the potential for “expensive misunderstandings.”  Id.  ConnSSA was also aware of 10 NRES Buy-All projects that “experienced added time and/or real or potential added costs to interconnect due to what developers believe is a disjointed internal communications process (lack of point person) within Eversource.”  ConnSSA Interrog. Resp. CAE-10, p. 1.  For Eversource specifically, ConnSSA noted contradictory instructions and confusion in the interconnection review process for NRES projects.  Id.  Last, ConnSSA requested the Authority allow line side taps for Buy-All interconnections if the taps are compliant with NEC and if the taps are approved by local authorities.  EDC Compliance, Aug. 16, 2023, Attachment A, p. 1. Notably, while Eversource permits line side interconnections under several circumstances, UI did not agree to permit line side interconnections for NRES projects.19 EDC Compliance, Aug. 16, 2023, pp. 1-3; Motion 12, Ruling 2, Sept. 1, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03.  

The Authority conducted discovery to determine the benefits and costs of ConnSSA’s proposal.  Eversource argued that consolidation of interconnection approvals would decrease applicant flexibility, increase interconnection application review timelines, and expand the information required for a complete interconnection application. Eversource Interrog. Resp. CAE-6, p. 1.  Similarly, UI argued that consolidation of the interconnection approval processes would increase a project’s contingent approval timeline by requiring “a much more thorough and detailed technical review” earlier in the process.  UI Interrog. Resp. CAE-6, p. 1.  Additionally, during the review of a NRES interconnection application, five departments were involved in Eversource’s process, while nine departments were involved in UI’s process.  Eversource Interrog. Resp. CAE7, p. 1; UI Interrog. Resp. CAE-7, pp. 1-2.  Further, UI provided evidence of coordination between UI’s departments during the interconnection review process and stated that an engineer was assigned as a technical main point of contact throughout a project’s lifecycle.  UI Interrog. Resp. CAE-8, pp. 1-2; UI Interrog. Resp. CAE-9, p. 1.  Conversely, Eversource stated that coordination between its departments “occurs on an as-needed basis” and that an individual facilitator serves as the single point of contact for administrative interconnection requirements.  Eversource Interrog. Resp. CAE-8, p. 1; Eversource Interrog. Resp. CAE-9, p. 1.  Finally, upon further consideration of line side interconnections for NRES projects, UI would consider permitting such interconnections in a manner similar to Eversource if several safety requirements were met.20  

Upon reviewing the feedback provided by stakeholders, the Authority is concerned that the current NRES interconnection process is not aligned with the Program Objectives, particularly objectives one, two, three, and four, and, as such, directs several changes.  First, to ensure the NRES interconnection process and guidelines are clearer to Program participants, the Authority directs the EDCs to hold at least two meetings annually prior to both the February and August solicitations with Program stakeholders reviewing the NRES interconnection process, guidelines, and acceptable configurations for both Netting and Buy-All projects.  Such meetings shall be conducted simultaneously with the EDC-led bidding conferences.  

Second, so the Authority can continue to monitor interconnection timelines for NRES projects, each EDC shall file as compliance annually by August 1, a NRES Interconnection Report.  The Report shall consist of a summary of the state of interconnection for all NRES projects and shall include, at a minimum: (1) the interconnection status of each NRES project; (2) the EDC interconnection approval due date for each project per approved interconnection guidelines; (3) the number of days from when all required interconnection materials were submitted to the utility for each project to interconnection approval, or to when the data was pulled for the report, if interconnection approval has not been granted; (4) the date for which data was pulled for the report; (5) the NRES Program project attrition rate; (6) a list of the most common reasons for interconnection delays; and (7) EDC-proposed solutions for each of the most common reasons delaying interconnection.  

Third, by February 1, 2024, each EDCs shall assign a single point of contact for all interconnection matters related to each NRES project, to alleviate developer confusion over the NRES interconnection process.  While the EDCs each currently have a single point of contact for NRES projects throughout the interconnection process, it is not clear whether the single point of contact serves as a resource for all interconnection requirements, since UI’s single point of contact assists in technical matters, while Eversource’s single point of contact assists in administrative matters.  UI Interrog. Resp. CAE-9, p. 1; Eversource Interrog. Resp. CAE-9, p. 1.  For clarity, contact information for the single point of contact for each project shall be made available to the relevant NRES project developer upon request and to facilitate the timely conveyance of information.  

Fourth, to alleviate misunderstandings between the numerous EDC departments involved in the NRES interconnection review process that can be costly for NRES projects, the EDCs shall file for Authority review and approval by February 1, 2024, a plan for better coordination between all departments involved in the NRES interconnection approval process.21  The plan shall clearly outline the steps each EDC will take to ensure that all EDC departments are in agreement during the interconnection review process, so that interconnection approvals or communications with developers are not contradicted by another EDC department.  

The Authority finds that the above changes will further the first and second Program Objectives by fostering the sustained and orderly development of the state’s Class I renewable energy industry and by deploying the full MW capacity allowable under statute by preventing project attrition during the interconnection approval process.  At this time, the Authority will not, however, require a consolidation of all NRES interconnection approval processes, as suggested by ConnSSA, due to concern that this change would result in increased NRES interconnection approval timelines and higher upfront costs earlier in the interconnection approval process, to the detriment of applicant flexibility and the Program Objectives.  

Fifth, the Authority directs UI to file as compliance by February 1, 2024, a list of reasons, supported by both qualitative and quantitative evidence, outlining why line side interconnections for NRES projects should not be approved in UI territory in a manner similar to Eversource.  The Authority concludes that, ideally, NRES interconnection requirements would be consistent across both utilities, to reduce developer confusion over disparate EDC interconnection requirements.  Nevertheless, the Authority recognizes that different interconnection procedures for each Company may necessitate different requirements in allowing line side tap interconnections.  Additionally, no evidence was provided in the present proceeding explaining why line side tap disallowance hinders the deployment of NRES projects in UI territory.  If, however, stakeholders provide datadriven evidence for why the disallowance of line side taps in UI territory presents a barrier to NRES project deployment in the next annual review proceeding, or if UI does not provide compelling reasons in its compliance filing for why line side interconnections should not be approved in UI territory in a manner similar to Eversource, the Authority may direct UI to allow line side interconnections for NRES projects during the Year 4 Program review.  

Sixth, the Authority remains concerned about speculative NRES bids that have not conducted due diligence for expected interconnection costs.  Consequently, the Authority recognizes that the EDC proposal to require a complete interconnection application and Feasibility Study prior to bid submission may reduce NRES project attrition.  However, absent more specific data on the reasons for NRES project cancellations, the Authority concludes that additional action is not needed at this time because the $\$25.00/\mathsf{k W}$ performance assurance fee implemented in last year’s annual review should sufficiently reduce speculative bids.  Year 2 Decision, p. 9.  Ultimately, the Authority will continue to monitor NRES interconnection timelines and project attrition rates in future annual reviews and will take action as appropriate.  

Finally, the Authority directs stakeholders to the Motion No. 12 Ruling 2 in Docket No. 22-08-03, where the Authority approved a consensus recommendation to model BuyAll projects as generation for interconnection purposes unless there is a considerable load component present, such as battery storage.  See Motion No. 12 Ruling 2, Sept. 1, 2023, pp. 1-4.  This previously approved change should alleviate developer concerns by reducing Buy-All interconnection costs, to the benefit of the first, second, and third Program Objectives.22  

# 1. Hosting Capacity Map Changes  

In the Year 2 Decision, the Authority found that the EDCs’ practices for updating hosting capacity could be enhanced to better meet the Program Objectives and, consequently, directed the EDCs to implement improvements to the hosting capacity maps.  Year 2 Decision, pp. 26-28.  Further, the Authority directed the EDCs to file “a proposal, including cost estimates, any required system upgrades, and a timeline for implementing SAVE’s proposal to update capacity maps in daily or real time as well as a plan for utilizing real-time hosting capacity map data for other clean energy programs and distribution system planning activities.”  Id., p. 41.  In response, on June 27, 2023, and June 30, 2023, respectively, Eversource and UI filed separate proposals and timelines with the Authority.  

Eversource’s proposal to develop automated tools enabling more frequent updates included an estimated cost of approximately $\$1$ ,500,000 in incremental funds with recurring costs of $\$150,000$ per year, and a potential completion date of December 2024. Eversource Compliance, June 27, 2023, p. 2.  Further, in addition to updating hosting capacity maps automatically, Eversource’s proposal would use the hosting capacity map data to automate interconnection screens “and automate many of the data required to perform an impact study to improve the efficiency of the interconnection study process.” Id.  UI's recommended proposal would involve capacity map updates triggered by circuit modifications and updates to distributed energy resource (DER) tables twice a month, with an estimated cost of $\$660,000$ , recurring costs of $\$150,000$ per year, and a completion timeline of one to two years.  UI Compliance, Attachment 1, June 30, 2023, p. 10.  UI’s proposed upgrades would also include improved substation modeling to consider interactions between neighboring circuits to more accurately reflect substation capacity.  Tech Mt’g Tr., Sept. 12, 2023, 39:24-41:11.  Moreover, at an additional cost, UI’s proposal would automate interconnection screens, simplify the interconnection process, and increase impact study efficiency.  Id., p. 10.  UI also included estimated costs for daily updates to the hosting capacity maps, estimated at $\$1$ ,500,000 with annual recurring costs of about $\$980,000$ .  UI Compliance, Attachment 1, June 30, 2023, p. 8. Notably, the EDCs’ proposals envisioned more frequent updates to the hosting capacity maps (e.g., biweekly or triggered by circuit changes) but did not recommend daily or realtime updates as proposed by SAVE, because the EDCs believe that the volume of DER applications does not justify the computational and staff resources required for daily updates.  Id., p. 9; Eversource Compliance, June 27, 2023, p. 8.  The Authority subsequently sought stakeholder comments on the EDCs’ proposals to update capacity maps.  Notice, July 21, 2023, pp. 4-5.  

Lodestar expressed support for the EDCs’ proposal to update capacity maps, stating that “this investment will ensure greater efficiency and ultimately save costs for both EDCs and developers while minimizing impacts to rate payers.”  Lodestar Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 2.  TRITEC also supported robust, cost-effective improvements to capacity mapping systems, noting that such maps are a vital tool for developers to efficiently identify appropriate sites for distributed generation projects.  

TRITEC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 7.  Further, TRITEC argued that more accurate and timely map updates would increase and accelerate the siting of appropriate generation projects in the state, thereby advancing the first, second, and third Program Objectives.  Id.  Independence Solar similarly supported the EDCs’ efforts to update capacity maps more frequently and automate more of the screening process but noted that these changes should not compromise data quality, as the purpose of the maps and screening tools is to make decisions based on reliable information.  Independence Solar Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 1.  

Conversely, Ecogy argued that the Authority should direct the EDCs to substantiate the cost estimates for implementing the proposed improvements.  Ecogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 4.  Specifically, Ecogy proposed that the EDCs present a detailed line-item budget with explanations of where assumptions were derived from and compare the cost estimates with those of other utilities, subsidiaries, and affiliates in neighboring states and across the U.S.  Id.  Verogy also expressed concern about the EDCs’ estimated improvement costs, while also supporting efforts to update hosting capacity maps on a daily or real-time frequency to improve the efficiency of screening and study processes.  Verogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 7.  Verogy suggested that the benefits of the proposed updates would not be exclusive to distributed generation developers, but would also benefit the EDCs’ grid planning processes and commercial and industrial customers in evaluating whether existing infrastructure can support new or expanded operations.  Id.  Verogy suggested, therefore, that the costs of updating hosting capacity maps and interconnection screening tools be shared rather than borne solely by distributed generation projects.  Id.  

The Authority concludes that implementation of the EDCs’ proposals to update capacity maps more frequently, automate interconnection screens, and implement modeling improvements would enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of interconnection and deployment of distributed generation projects, in furtherance of the first and third Program Objectives.  Accordingly, the Authority provisionally approves the implementation plans for both EDCs filed in accordance with Order No. 19 of the Year 2 Decision.  Eversource Compliance, June 27, 2023; UI Compliance, Attachment 1, June 30, 2023.  Specifically, the Authority approves biweekly updates, as well as the automation and process improvements proposed separately by each EDC.  However, the Authority emphasizes that more frequent updates to hosting capacity maps will become increasingly important in the future as DER applications increase.  As such, the EDCs, in further developing and implementing the proposed upgrades, should aim to do so in a way that facilitates future automation of hosting capacity map updates on a more frequent basis than what is provisionally approved in this Decision.  Additionally, the Authority clarifies that the prudency of the costs associated with the capacity map upgrades will not be approved in this Decision and will be considered in the EDCs’ respective future rate adjustment mechanism (RAM) proceedings (e.g., Docket Nos. 24-01-03 and 24-01-04) when the their costs are filed for recovery.  

In addition, the Authority determines that further substantiation of the EDCs’ proposed implementation costs is warranted.  The Authority therefore directs the EDCs to conduct RFPs to solicit competitive cost proposals from third-party providers to implement the proposed capacity map improvements, and subsequently, compare the resulting bids to the estimated internal costs and determine which method can be implemented more effectively and at a lower cost to ratepayers.  In Written Exceptions, Eversource stated that it was already conducting an RFP to solicit bids for hosting capacity maps in Massachusetts and intended to utilize the same vendor for the Connecticut project rather than issue a separate RFP.  Eversource Exceptions, Nov. 1, 2023, pp. 6-7.  The Authority clarifies that Eversource will not be required to conduct a separate RFP for Connecticut’s hosting capacity map improvements.  However, in filing its RFP results, Eversource must include evidence to demonstrate that it has ensured the least-cost option was selected for the implementation of Connecticut’s hosting capacity map upgrades, including how the Company concluded that the near- and long-term costs associated with these projects would be minimized.  In addition, the Authority clarifies that any recurring costs needed to support biweekly hosting capacity map updates shall not include any costs associated with staff for resolving customer complaints, which are currently included in UI’s recurring cost estimate.  Tech Mt’g Tr., Sept. 12, 2023, 39:4-12. As noted in Section IV.I., such dispute resolution will be conducted by an ombudsperson in future Program years.  

Consequently, the Authority directs the EDCs to file as compliance with the Authority no later than June 1, 2024, the RFP results, including a comparison of timelines and cost estimates for completing the proposed hosting capacity map upgrades internally versus a third party and a narrative explanation as to how each Company has ensured the least-cost implementation, both in the near- and long-term, of the hosting capacity map upgrades provisionally approved in this Decision.  Further, the filings shall include updated, itemized costs of implementing the upgrades both externally and internally, to the fullest extent possible, including costs broken out by upfront and recurring costs.  The EDCs shall file such compliance for Authority review and approval in Docket Nos. 24-08- 03 and 17-12-03RE06.  Finally, by June 1, 2024, the EDCs shall present the timeline and cost estimates of their proposed upgrades to a meeting of the Interconnection Working Group, established in the Decision dated November 25, 2020, in Docket No. 17- 12- 03RE06, PURA Investigation into Distribution System Planning of the Electric Distribution Companies – Interconnection Standards and Practices.  

# I. OMBUDSPERSON  

The Authority previously stated that it would consider the inclusion of an independent ombudsperson, as first proposed in the Audit Report conducted by Sustainable Energy Advantage, LLC, in future Program years and intended to review the costs and benefits of the proposal in greater detail to make an informed decision in the Year 3 NRES Program review.  PURA Corresp., Jul. 27, 2022, Docket No. 22-08-03, Audit Report, p. 20; Year 2 Decision, p. 32.  Accordingly, the Authority requested comments on the inclusion of an independent ombudsperson for dispute resolution in the NRES Program.  Notice, June 15, 2023, p. 7.  Specifically, the Authority requested datadriven analysis, comments on the costs and benefits, information on the use of ombudspersons in other jurisdictions, and any specific areas of focus in the NRES Program that would benefit from the utilization of an ombudsperson.  

Verogy suggested that an ombudsperson could benefit both the EDCs and Program participants by alleviating the burden of administering the NRES RFP process and responding to inquiries.  Verogy Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 11-12.  Verogy noted that it is not uncommon for Program participants to receive delayed responses on timesensitive questions, likely due to the large volume of inquiries around NRES Program enrollment.  Id.  Further, Verogy argued that bid fees alone could potentially support the cost of an ombudsperson, and such fees could be redirected from the EDCs to the ombudsperson since the EDCs would no longer be required to administer the solicitations.  Id.  Independence Solar also strongly supported the inclusion of an ombudsperson for the NRES Program and noted that resolving issues via motion rulings can be a time-consuming process for all parties involved.  Independence Solar Corresp., June 15, 2023, p. 1.  

Similarly, TRITEC expressed support for the addition of an ombudsperson, noting that TRITEC’s motion (Motion No. 11) requesting clarification of location requirements for the Distressed Municipality bid preference is one example of an instance where an ombudsperson would be useful to make minor program changes and avoid unintended outcomes inconsistent with the Program Objectives.  TRITEC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 5; Motion 11 Ruling, June 7, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, p. 3.  In addition, ConnSSA cited an August 2020 report on interconnection commissioned by ConnSSA and prepared by Shute, Mihaly & Weinberger LLP, which in turn cites the Interstate Renewable Energy Council’s (IREC’s) model interconnection procedures based on dispute resolution practices in California, Massachusetts, and Minnesota as the national best practice. ConnSSA Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 7-8.  ConnSSA noted that these model interconnection procedures include a dispute resolution process where facts are presented to a “knowledgeable and neutral party who provides a recommendation for a mutually satisfactory solution expeditiously.”  Id.  

The OCC separately noted that ombudspersons have been successfully used in other jurisdictions in similar capacities but recommended that an independent ombudsperson be introduced on a trial basis, with evaluation of the extent of program operation improvements relative to program costs after one to two years.  OCC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 4.  Conversely, the EDCs noted that while an ombudsperson may expedite the resolution of issues related to NRES procurement, there are also potential disadvantages of including an ombudsperson in the NRES Program. EDC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 13.  More specifically, the EDCs argued that staffing an ombudsperson may be a challenge, and “there is no assurance an ombudsperson would reduce the number of rulings required from the Authority.”  Id., pp. 13-14.  

The Authority concludes that, consistent with broad stakeholder support, an independent ombudsperson, paid in part through NRES Program fees, would further the Program Objectives by providing NRES participants with an avenue to resolve disputes with the EDCs in a timely manner.  For clarity, the sole functions of the ombudsperson shall be to (1) mediate disputes; (2) resolve Program questions that result from a dispute, elevating the issue to the Authority as necessary;23 and (3) review and approve extension requests beyond the three-year in-service time period as discussed in Section IV.M., Project Extensions.  The EDCs shall still have responsibility over the administration of the NRES Program, including but not limited to, fielding and promptly answering Program questions.  Consequently, the Authority will issue a competitive RFP to hire an independent ombudsperson to serve as a dedicated Program resource to resolve Program disputes that do not require a ruling from the Authority.  The ombudsperson may also resolve disputes that do not require a ruling from the Authority in the SCEF Program, because stakeholders have expressed a similar desire for an independent arbitrator to settle disputes between developers and the SCEF Program Administrators.  Decision, Dec. 7, 2022, Docket No. 22-08-04, Annual Shared Clean Energy Facility Program Review – Year 4, pp. 19-20; EDC Corresp., June 16, 2023.  The ombudsperson will also provide support in the RRES Program, which may see increased developer disputes with the EDCs if project applications and deployment levels remain at historic levels.  Decision, Nov. 1, 2023, Docket No. 23-08-02, Annual Residential Renewable Energy Solutions Program Review - Year 3 (RRES Decision), p. 54.  

As the ombudsperson will serve as a resource for three programs (i.e., NRES, SCEF, and RRES), only $50\%$ of the cost of the ombudsperson shall be recovered by the EDCs through NRES application fees.24  Accordingly, the Authority directs the EDCs to file as compliance by June 1, 2024, new NRES application fees to take effect during the Year 3 August solicitation.  If the revenues from the current nonrefundable NRES application fees exceed the cost of administering the NRES Program plus $50\%$ of the cost of the ombudsperson, the EDCs shall state so in their compliance and shall not increase current NRES application fees.  Last, the Authority will file a cost estimate for the ombudsperson in the present docket when the RFP process has concluded, which shall inform the EDCs’ compliance filing and NRES fee recommendation.  

# J. PERFORMANCE ASSURANCE AND APPLICATION FEES  

In the Year 2 Decision, the Authority implemented a $\$25.00$ per kW performance assurance fee to reduce speculative NRES bids.  Year 2 Decision, p. 9.  Additionally, the Authority decided that the EDCs must return performance assurance fees “promptly” if at least one of several conditions was met, including a bid not being selected for procurement.25  Id.  Further, the Authority stated that it would continue to monitor the performance assurance fee, to ensure that Program participation was not negatively impacted.  Id., p. 10.  Accordingly, the Authority requested written comments “on the timing of performance assurance fee refunds, and whether the EDCs should be required to return the performance fees from the first auction, where applicable, prior to the start of the August NRES procurement.”  Notice, July 21, 2023, p. 6.  

Verogy argued that the EDCs should be required to return the performance assurance fee at least one month prior to the start of the following auction.  Verogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 25.  Otherwise, the performance assurance fee will serve as a barrier to Program entry for customers with limited cash, including SAM customers and customers in Distressed Municipalities, by “essentially doubling the Performance Assurance fee for unsuccessful projects wishing to re-submit into a subsequent auction without ever having received an initial Performance Assurance refund.”  Id.  If performance assurance refunds at least one month prior to the start of a NRES auction are not allowed, however, Verogy believed that the performance assurance fee “should be allowed to be ‘recycled’ by the same applicant and applied to a project being resubmitted.”  Id., p. 26.  Further, Ecogy, Lodestar, and ConnSSA supported Verogy’s argument that the performance assurance fee be refunded at least one month prior to the start of the subsequent NRES auction.  Ecogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 5; Lodestar Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 4; ConnSSA Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 8.  

Conversely, the EDCs noted that the performance assurance fee would be refunded if “the bid is not selected under the procurement for which the bid was submitted,” which is not known until the Authority accepts the NRES bids selected by the EDCs.  EDC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 13.  The EDCs further noted that if the Authority rejected any EDC bid selections, the EDCs would have “to select other projects in the queue and would therefore require Performance Assurance for those projects.”  Id. Consequently, the EDCs argued that performance assurance must be maintained for all projects until the Authority approves the EDCs’ bid selections.  Id.  The EDCs also argued that internal processes for performance assurance refunds take time to set up.  Id.  For example, on August 1, Eversource implemented a new method for refunding performance assurance fees, which takes only a “few days after the refund is requested,” while UI is continuing to investigate processes to expedite performance assurance fee refunds.  Id.  

The Authority determines that changes are warranted to the timing of performance assurance refunds to ensure that the performance assurance fee does not unnecessarily hinder Program participation for participants with unsuccessful bids who wish to apply for multiple solicitations.  The Authority therefore directs the EDCs to allow performance assurance refunds for all projects after the selection and notification of winning bidders for the medium, large, and low emission project categories – at the sole request of the bidder.26  Any bids requesting performance assurance refunds before the Authority’s final acceptance of the solicitation results will be considered withdrawn for the purposes of future bid selection (i.e., if the Authority rejects any EDC bid selections or if any chosen bids drop out of the queue).  If a bidder does not request a performance assurance refund after the notification of winning bidders, the EDCs shall initiate performance assurance fee refunds to the bidders of unselected projects upon the Authority’s final approval of the EDC-selected solicitation bids.  Additionally, the Authority strongly encourages the EDCs to minimize the refund window to the fullest extent possible, so that when a developer initiates a refund request, the performance assurance refund occurs before the next solicitation.27  Finally, the EDCs shall inform applicants of the process for obtaining performance assurance fee refunds directly in the email sent to bidders of projects not selected, incorporating information on the above direction that a performance assurance fee refund will result in bid withdrawal from the solicitation in which the bid was first received and, as such, that such bid is ineligible to be selected in that solicitation if another project drops out or is not approved by PURA.  Ultimately, the above changes will lower solicitation entry barriers posed by the performance assurance fee, thereby advancing the first, second, third, and fourth Program Objectives.  

Last, the Authority concludes that additional information is needed to inform potential changes to the nonrefundable $\$300$ NRES application fee required from all bidders to offset the administrative costs of the NRES Program.  See EDC Compliance, March 13, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, Attachment 1b, p. 29.  Notably, the original nonrefundable application fee was calculated based on the assumed administrative costs of reviewing 808 bids across both EDCs, a calculation that was made over two years ago. Year 1 Decision, pp. 14-15.  Consequently, by August 1, 2025, and annually thereafter for the duration of the NRES Program, the Authority directs each EDC to file in the most recent NRES annual review docket a proposed nonrefundable application fee to cover the administrative costs associated with running the NRES Program, based on the most recent application numbers and administrative cost data.  The filing shall include a total estimate of all NRES administrative costs for the prior year, in addition to the total nonrefundable fees collected by each EDC via NRES Program applications.  Ultimately, given robust Program participation at current fee levels, the Authority determines that this additional requirement will better ensure that Program administrative costs are entirely covered through nonrefundable application fees, thereby protecting nonparticipating ratepayers from potential rate increases made through the applicable RAM proceeding to cover NRES administrative costs in excess of nonrefundable fees collected.  

# K. RENEWABLE ENERGY CERTIFICATE BUYBACK  

In written comments, DEEP stated that the current NRES Program does not enable projects to be counted towards Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, creating a barrier to LEED certification for some Connecticut buildings. DEEP Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 6.  Specifically, DEEP noted that building owners seeking LEED certification must “demonstrate that the [RECs] are retained, owned, or retired on behalf of the party who has financial or operational control over the building’s electricity use.”  Id.  However, Conn. Gen. Stat. $\$16–244z$ and the NRES Program Manual require the EDCs to purchase all RECs generated by projects participating in the program.  DEEP proposed a revision to the NRES Program Manual to allow the EDCs to sell the RECs back to the building owner seeking LEED certification at a de minimis price pursuant to a form contract and retire the RECs on behalf of the building owner, conditional on the building achieving LEED certification.  Id., p. 7.  DEEP believed that this would be consistent with Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S16-244z(\mathsf{d})$ because Eversource would still purchase RECs from the project.  Id.  Further, DEEP argued that although the EDCs could earn more by selling the RECs elsewhere in the market, “the value of structuring the state’s renewable energy programs to encourage adoption of green building practices outweighs the cost of any lost revenues in the sale of RECs for this narrow subset of projects.”  Id.  In addition to the written comments, DEEP filed a motion (Motion No. 18) dated July 6, 2023, in Docket No. 22-08-03 requesting a one-time modification to the NRES Program Manual to allow a new DEEP headquarters building seeking LEED Platinum certification and NRES Program participation to buy back RECs from Eversource at a de minimis price.  Motion No. 18, p. 4.  

In response to Motion No. 18, the EDCs argued that DEEP’s proposed transaction structure would be administratively burdensome and would require modifications to the NRES Program Manual, Terms and Conditions, and Tariff Rider.  EDC Response to Motion No. 18, July 13, 2023, p. 2.  In addition, the EDCs stated that Eversource would be unable to retire the RECs in the NRES NEPOOL GIS account on behalf of the customer under the current program structure because there is no associated load.  Id., p. 1.  Further, the EDCs calculated that allowing DEEP to retain ownership of the RECs at no cost would lead to an increased cost to ratepayers of approximately $24\%$ over 20 years.  Id., p. 2.  Finally, the EDCs argued that Rate 980 allows customers to retain ownership of RECs and should be considered as an alternative to both the transaction proposed in Motion No. 18 and permanent changes to the NRES Program.  Id.  

The Authority subsequently requested stakeholder comments on DEEP’s proposed change to retain RECs from the project in question.  Notice, July 25, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, pp. 1-2.  In response, the EDCs recommended that any REC buyback should be set at the prevailing market price of the tariff term for Connecticut Class I RECs.  EDC Comments, Aug. 8, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, pp. 3-4. The EDCs further stated that this approach would match the market price that the EDCs could have realized and credited to ratepayers by selling RECs on the market, thus resulting in the most similar net cost to ratepayers as the EDCs’ current resale process.  Id.  OCC argued that any customer seeking to retain a project’s RECs should compensate the applicable EDC at the same value that the EDC would gain from selling the RECs because revenues from selling RECs are passed to ratepayers and thus offset some program costs.  OCC Comments, Aug. 9, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03.  Similarly, CIEC recommended that “the customer seeking to buy back their project RECs be responsible for any incremental costs incurred by their EDC to support that option.”  CIEC Comments, Aug. 8, 2023, Docket No, 22-08-03, p. 2.  

The Authority subsequently granted Motion No. 18 in part, allowing DEEP to retain and retire the project’s RECs, but ruled that DEEP shall buy back the RECs at the prevailing market price for Connecticut Class I RECs.  Motion No. 18 Ruling 2, Aug. 18, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03.  While recognizing the value of DEEP achieving LEED certification in advancing state energy efficiency and emissions targets, the Authority agreed with stakeholder comments that allowing DEEP to retain the RECs at a de minimis price contradicts the Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S$ 16-244z(d) requirement that REC sale or retirement be in the best interest of ratepayers, as well as the third Program Objective, ensuring least-cost outcomes.  Id.  The Authority further noted that Motion No. 18 presented a substantial request to modify the Program Manual and did not provide adequate opportunity for a broad and thorough stakeholder engagement process as part of an annual review proceeding.  Id.  

Accordingly, the Authority sought broader stakeholder comments on potential options for REC buybacks in the NRES Program, including stakeholder support or opposition, potential costs and benefits, and “proposals for REC buyback values and/or methodologies to determine REC buyback values, including, but not limited to, setting the REC price at a value to cover any administrative costs associated with the implementation of a plan to have the EDCs resell all RECs generated by relevant projects and retire them on behalf of building owners.”  Notice, July 21, 2023, p. 5.  Further, the Authority requested comments regarding how RECs produced by projects seeking LEED certification should be dealt with to account for NEPOOL-GIS and state emissions accounting practices.  Id.  

DEEP reiterated its position that REC buybacks should not exceed a de minimis price as encouraging retirement of RECs on behalf of the building owner is consistent with the NRES Program purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  DEEP Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, pp. 4-5.  Further, DEEP stated that under current system conditions, no output from the behind-the-meter (BTM) generation flows to the pool transmission facility, and therefore, BTM generation serves as a load reducer and reduces RPS requirements.  Id.  Conversely, OCC restated that allowing participants to retain RECs without paying market value for them disrupts the cost-benefit balance of the NRES program, and further noted that participants could be permitted the right to purchase the RECs for the same value the EDC would receive on the market.  OCC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, pp. 7-8.  However, OCC stated it would not oppose giving participants the opportunity to buy RECs from the EDCs at market price before they are offered on the open market.  Id.  The EDCs, in addition to the previously filed comments in Docket No. 22-08-03, suggested that the EDCs “would need to establish processes to determine pricing, bill counterparties, ensure payment is received, and manage REC transactions” for the buyback process, and that this may require additional employees to manage such projects if the number of projects participating in such a structure increases in future years.  EDC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 11.  

ConnSSA noted that there are several reasons non-residential customers might want to retain the RECs generated by their renewable energy project, including LEED certification, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals, or compliance with supply chain or vendor requirements, and that the state’s renewable energy programs should be structured to support these goals.  ConnSSA Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 5. ConnSSA agreed with OCC that project owners should buy back the RECs at the market rate the EDCs would have otherwise received.  Id.  However, ConnSSA argued that a more straightforward option for retaining RECs would be a “full value, or close to full value retail net metering tariff without RECs bundled in the tariff.”  Id.  Verogy argued that implementing a REC buyback option would add significant complexity to the program, and any rules implemented would be subject to fluctuating market conditions and manipulation by market participants.  Verogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 8.  Instead, Verogy suggested that project owners have the option to retain RECs and voluntarily forego REC incentive payments.  Id.  Like ConnSSA, Verogy also suggested a net metering tariff available outside of the NRES program in which customers receive full retail value, or a value between retail value and avoided costs for energy exports, while retaining RECs.  Id., p. 9.  

Conversely, Allco opposed DEEP’s proposal regarding REC buybacks at a de minimis price, and further suggested that the only transactions permitted by Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S16{-}244z(\mathsf{d})$ are for the EDCs to sell into NEPOOL or retire the RECs to satisfy the EDCs’ obligations.  Allco Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, pp. 5-6.  Instead, Allco suggested that “DEEP should seek a statutory amendment that would allow an ‘energy only’ bid by all bidders” during the next legislative session.  Id.  

The Authority further inquired about stakeholders’ positions regarding setting the price for REC buybacks at the market rate compared to the Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) price, including whether efficiencies could be gained from not utilizing a variable market rate and whether the ACP price is a fair proxy for the market price.  Tech Mt’g Tr., Sept. 12, 2023, 64:17-67:11.  Eversource agreed that the ACP price, as a set value for the term of the agreement, would be simpler to administer.  Id.  Eversource further stated that ACP price would be a reasonable proxy for the REC price on the market, noting that the current ACP price is about $\$40$ while the current REC market price is about $\$38$ to $\$39$ .  Id.  DEEP agreed that the ACP price would be administratively simple.  Id.  However, DEEP expressed concern that the ACP might not fairly reflect the fluctuating market price in the long run, noting that while REC prices have been close to the ACP in recent years, they are volatile and have reached very low prices in the past. Id.  

The Authority determines that implementing a REC buyback option for Program participants would advance Program Objectives by aligning the NRES Program with other emissions reductions goals, including LEED certification.  Further, the Authority agrees with stakeholders that a REC buyback option should not be implemented in such a way that increases ratepayer costs, in accordance with the third Program Objective, and adds significant administrative complexity to the Program.  Importantly, a REC buyback option does not alter the EDCs’ obligations under Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S$ 16-244(d) and the Program Manual.  The relevant part of Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S$ 16-244z(d) requires the Authority to direct the EDCs to retire RECs it purchases in connection with the NRES Program.28  In this instance, the EDCs are still purchasing the RECs and, ultimately, retiring them. Indeed, the contemplated transaction described below is a distinct, additional transaction that will take place after the EDCs have already purchased the RECs, and such RECs will be retired.  

Accordingly, the Authority determines that NRES participants wishing to buy back the RECs generated by their onsite renewable project shall do so at the ACP price over the course of the tariff term.  The Authority intends for this option to increase Program flexibility for participants while minimizing ratepayer impacts and administrative billing costs.  The Authority directs the EDCs to make the REC buyback option available to participants by the Year 3 August NRES solicitation.  Additionally, the Authority directs the EDCs to file for Authority review and approval, by June 1, 2024, a draft contract whereby the NRES customer can purchase and retire the RECs associated with the customer’s project from the EDC, in Docket Nos. 23-08-03 and 24-08-03.  Such contract shall be separate and distinct from any existing NRES tariffs or agreements (i.e., such contract should supplement existing documents, as the REC transaction between the EDC and customer will occur after the EDC has already purchased the RECs via the NRES Program).  Further, for projects intending to utilize the REC buyback option, the upfront administrative costs of implementing such a transaction shall be added to the project’s application fee.  Accordingly, by June 1, 2024, the Authority directs the EDCs to file as compliance the estimated administrative costs per project associated with allowing REC buybacks for NRES customers in Docket Nos. 23-08-03 and 24-08-03.  

The Authority further clarifies that the implementation of a separate net metering tariff, as suggested by several stakeholders, falls outside of the scope of the NRES program annual review, and consequently will not be considered at this time.  Notably, such a program is not authorized by statute, as Conn. Gen. Stat. $\$16-244z(\mathsf{c})$ provides an annual capacity cap for the NRES Program.  Further, REC prices can be bid at zero under the existing Program Manual.  As such, the Authority finds that implementing a separate tariff without RECs bundled in the tariff price, in addition to the existing Rates 980 and SG2, is not currently necessary or in the best interest of ratepayers.  Finally, the Authority notes that while REC buybacks at a de minimis price will not be allowed under the current Program Manual, the transaction structure could potentially be changed if, in the future, the RPS structure is altered such that any RECs from projects under the NRES Program are retired and deducted from the statewide annual REC requirement rather than sold on the market.  

# L. AGRIVOLTAICS  

# 1. Definitional Changes  

In the Year 2 proceeding, the EDCs proposed “requiring the submission of a local property tax bill, up to three years of tax returns, and a farmer’s sales tax exemption permit to prove that an agricultural applicant qualifies for the Program.”  Year 2 Decision, p. 23.  Stakeholders objected to the EDCs’ proposed changes to the eligibility requirements for an agricultural customer and supported the original agricultural Program requirements, which were based on Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S$ 1-1(q).  Id.  The Authority did not approve the EDCs’ proposed changes to the definition of an agricultural customer because the Authority found that the proposed changes would “add complexity to [agricultural] projects, to the detriment of Program Objectives.”  Id., p. 24.  Nevertheless, the Authority stated that “the EDCs may suggest a new definition of agriculture during the annual review process next year, which is less administratively burdensome so long as such definition is thoroughly vetted by the solar industry and other stakeholders.”  Id. Further, the Authority determined that a new proposed definition would be “especially compelling … if the definition received input from or the approval of [the Department of Agriculture (DoAG)].”  Id.  

In the current annual review proceeding, the EDCs proposed requiring that all agricultural customers confirm that the prior three years’ tax returns have a Schedule F, submit a valid farmer’s tax exemption permit, and have a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) classification code beginning with an 11.  Motion No. 5, Attachment 1b, p. 3.  Notably, the EDCs modified the definition of an agricultural customer in conjunction with DoAg.  Id.; DoAg Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 3.  The EDCs also argued that the modified definition would advance the fourth Program Objective by enabling Program accessibility for customers.  Motion No. 5, Attachment 1b, p. 3.  

Two developers, TRITEC and Verogy, disagreed with the EDCs’ proposed changes to the definition of an agricultural customer.  TRITEC argued that the proposed changes were “overly restrictive and hostile to carbon-free energy generation” in Connecticut.  TRITEC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 9.  TRITEC further argued that the proposed change would contradict legislative intent by excluding non-commercial farmers from the Program.  Id.  Moreover, TRITEC noted that owners of vacant farmland could restart farming with the revenue used from the Program.  Id.  Additionally, Verogy noted that the issue surrounding the definition of an agricultural customer was adjudicated by the Authority last year and argued that the proposed changes would place “unnecessary burden on NRES Program Participants.”  Verogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, pp. 9-10.  

The Authority accepts, with modification, the EDCs’ proposed changes to the definition of an agricultural customer.  Ultimately, as alluded to in the Year 2 Decision, the Authority finds the EDCs’ proposed changes this year more compelling because it was informed by the expertise of and received approval from DoAg.  Additionally, the Authority finds that the current agricultural definition lacks sufficient specificity to easily confirm eligibility and, as a result, is administratively difficult for the EDCs to enforce.  See EDC Compliance, March 13, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, Attachment 2b, p. 3.  However, the Authority determines that changes are warranted to the EDCs’ proposed agricultural requirements to ensure that the new requirements are not administratively burdensome to stakeholders and to support the first Program Objective, the sustained and orderly development of the state’s Class I renewable energy industry.  Accordingly, the EDCs shall require the following: one year of tax returns with a Schedule F, a farmer’s tax exemption permit, and a NAICS classification code beginning with an 11.  

The Authority clarifies that any of the proposed requirements may be fulfilled with documentation that was valid at any point in the last three years (i.e., a farmer’s tax exemption permit that was valid three years ago would fulfill that requirement) to ensure that the agricultural definition is not unnecessarily narrow, and to provide property owners with fallow farmland the opportunity to obtain new revenue through the Program to restart their farming operations.  Further, the Authority concludes that a grace period is needed before the new agricultural requirements can be implemented, so that projects currently under development that may be eligible for the old agricultural definition but not the new definition are not harmed by the proposed change.  As a result, the new agricultural requirements shall not be implemented by the EDCs until the Year 3 August NRES solicitation.  The EDCs shall update the Program documents for the Year 3 August NRES solicitation by June 1, 2024, and file such documents as compliance with the Authority.  

# 2. Dual Use Agrivoltaic Bid Preference  

Further, in compliance with Order No. 3 of the Year 2 Decision, the EDCs proposed creating a bid preference for dual use agrivoltaic projects, without recommending a specific definition or bid preference amount.  Motion No. 4, pp. 2-3.  The EDCs noted that DoAG was working with DEEP to implement a similar bid preference for the SCEF Program in Docket No. 23-08-04.29  Id., p. 3.  Consequently, the EDCs proposed that the same bid preference amount and eligibility criteria be approved for both the SCEF and NRES Programs to support “the goal of aligning bid preferences across state programs.” Id.  Additionally, a project would be determined to be dual use agrivoltaic if the project site was being used for agricultural activities, “as determined by the EDCs in conjunction with [DoAg].”  Motion No. 5, Attachment 1b, p. 5.  The EDCs stated that a dual use agrivoltaic bid preference “could have positive benefits on Program participation by allowing State farmland to maximize versatility and value.”  Id., pp. 2-3.  

DoAg recommended siting solar on non-farmland to protect important farmland soils.  DoAg Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 4.  Nevertheless, if commercial solar farmland siting cannot be avoided, DoAg recognized that a higher price cap for sites with dual use farming may be needed to maintain a site’s agricultural production.  Id., pp. 4-5.  DoAg stated that it was working with the EDCs and DEEP to develop a framework for an agrivoltaics bid preference and noted several requirements that could be used to determine bid preference eligibility, including panel height and row width, demonstration that the site’s agricultural products will not be affected by sunlight reduction, and access to a site for a project’s duration for the purpose of scientific research.  Id., p. 5.  To enforce a dual use agrivoltaic bid preference for the duration of the project, DoAg proposed that a bond be issued “to cover all costs associated with stewardship including inspections and enforcement,” and including annual certifications that the project site continues to meet the requirements of dual use farming.  Id.  

In response to the EDCs’ bid preference proposal, TRITEC opposed language that suggested that the EDCs have the authority to determine whether a project is dual use agrivoltaic.  TRITEC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 9.  TRITEC also recommended that the Authority “set out specific guidelines for what documents should be submitted with bids to determine whether a project” qualifies for the proposed bid preference.  Id., pp. 9- 10.  Last, Verogy argued that the EDCs’ proposed definition for a dual use agrivoltaic project was not “reliable or easily determinable.”  Verogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 10.  

The Authority declines to approve a bid preference for dual use agrivoltaic projects for the NRES Program due to concerns about the administrative difficulties and costs associated with verifying whether a project site remains dual use over the entire lifespan of the NRES tariff (i.e., 20 years), which could negatively impact the third Program Objective, ensuring least cost outcomes, and the fourth Program Objective, customer accessibility through a simplified Program design.  Ultimately, absent additional cost data and more specific eligibility criteria, the Authority cannot approve a bid preference for dual use agrivoltaic projects.  

# M. PROJECT EXTENSIONS  

The Authority issued a Notice of Request for Written Comments on June 1, 2023, requesting comments on NRES project extension requests, including whether extensions should be allowed, and, if so, under what circumstances.  Specifically, the Authority requested comments on the following eligibility criteria for extensions: (1) the generation facility or project is unique and more complex than ordinary customer-sided distributed generation installation projects, such as having additional technology-specific regulatory or local siting requirements; (2) the project developer has worked diligently and in good faith in developing the project since inception; (3) the project is near completion or likely to begin commercial operation within the requested extended deadline; and (4) a significant portion of the total project investment has already been made and would potentially be stranded if the contract is terminated.  Notice, June 1, 2023, p. 8.  The Authority also noted that the current Program Manual requires that projects achieve an in-service date three years from the Authority’s approval of the NRES Tariff award without exception.  EDC Compliance, Mar. 13, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, Attachment 2a, p. 17.  

Independence Solar argued for additions to the three-year extension period, particularly for instances where extensions are requested for reasons outside the control of the developer, such as the interconnection process.  Independence Solar Corresp., June 15, 2023, p. 2.  Additionally, Allco supported extension requests beyond the threeyear maximum and cited Vermont’s statutory definition as one workable solution.30  Allco Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 3.  Similarly, ConnSSA believed extensions should be allowed “for good faith instances … and for other issues that are entirely out of developers’ control.”  ConnSSA Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 9.  TRITEC also argued in favor of automatic extensions for any good cause to increase project certainty, reduce investment risk premiums, and prevent “a chilling effect on [Connecticut’s] solar development.” TRITEC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 7.  Further, Verogy supported extensions beyond three years and cited several scenarios where a project might require such extensions, including lengthy interconnection and siting timelines, which are required for larger NRES projects.  Verogy Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 14-16.  

Conversely, CIEC took no position on project extension requests.  However, if extension requests are allowed, CIEC believed that the project’s bid and ratepayer support should remain unchanged from the original bid.  CIEC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 4.  Further, the EDCs stated that while three years is generally adequate time to complete a project given their experience with the LREC/ZREC Program, extensions may be warranted in unique cases.  EDC Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 15-16.  More specifically, the EDCs noted they would support extensions if projects have “made diligent efforts to complete development milestones and remain committed and able to complete and operate an eligible project.”  Id., p. 16.  Nevertheless, the EDCs averred that the Authority should not establish rigid criteria for extension requests because extension requests would be better considered on a case-by-case basis, possibly by an independent ombudsperson.  Id.  

Consistent with broad stakeholder support, the Authority determines extension requests beyond three years may be warranted for the NRES Program.  NRES projects shall therefore be eligible for an extension if at least one of the following five criteria are met: (1) the generation facility or project is unique and more complex than ordinary customer-sided distributed generation installation projects, such as having additional technology-specific regulatory or local siting requirements; (2) the project developer has worked diligently and in good faith in developing the project since inception; (3) the project is near completion or likely to begin commercial operation within the requested extended deadline; (4) a significant portion of the total project investment has already been made and would potentially be stranded if the contract is terminated; and/or (5) the interconnection process extended beyond the utilities’ initial estimates and/or significantly (e.g., one month) beyond the average interconnection process timeline.  Such extension requests shall be granted in proportion to the delay experienced and/or the amount of time demonstrated that is needed, up to one year, to complete the project.  All extension requests shall be handled by the ombudsperson, with notification of the ombudsperson’s decision on any extension request to be provided directly to the relevant EDCs’ NRES Program personnel and submitted as a compliance filing as soon as practicable in the NRES annual review docket related to the solicitation year in which the project was selected (e.g., Docket No. 22-08-03 if the project was selected in Year 2 of the Program, i.e., calendar year 2023).  The ombudsman shall also annually file a summary of any extension request denials in the relevant NRES proceeding by August 1.  Further, the Authority recognizes that circumstances may arise beyond the established criteria, which may also warrant extension request approval.  Consequently, any project pursuing an extension request that does not meet at least one of the established criteria shall be subject to a case-by-case review from the independent ombudsperson established pursuant to Section IV.I. of this Decision.  

Allowing extensions beyond three years in these specific circumstances will help ensure projects on track for completion are not unnecessarily deterred for scenarios beyond the developer’s control.  Moreover, the Authority concludes such extensions will further the first, second, and third Program Objectives by fostering the sustained and orderly development of the state’s Class I renewable energy industry, by deploying the full MW allowed by statute, and by ensuring least-cost outcomes.  Thus, the Authority directs the EDCs to incorporate the above direction in the Program Manual to be filed with the Authority in compliance with this Decision.  

# N. MULTIFAMILY AFFORDABLE HOUSING PARTICIPATION  

The Authority approved individually metered multifamily affordable housing project participation in the RRES Program last year during the annual review of the RRES Program.  Decision, Nov. 2, 2022, Docket No. 22-08-02, Annual Residential Renewable Solutions Program Review – Year 2, pp. 11-14.  Additionally, to participate in the RRES Program, multifamily affordable housing projects must equally distribute at least $20\%$ of the financial benefit of the RRES tariff to tenants residing at the project site.31  Id.  The Authority is also aware of at least five multifamily projects that have been selected through the NRES small zero emissions solicitation in Eversource’s and UI’s respective service territories.  See Eversource Compliance to Order No. 5, July 7, 2023, Docket No. 22-08- 03, Confidential Exhibit B2; UI Compliance to Order Nos. 19 and 20, Nov. 8, 2022, Docket No. 21-08-03, Attachment 1.  

The Authority is concerned that multifamily affordable housing projects could mistakenly or intentionally apply for the NRES Program instead of the RRES Program, even though the RRES Program offers greater total financial incentives to projects. Importantly, and in contrast to the NRES Program, the RRES Program ensures tenant inclusivity by requiring that at least $20\%$ of the project’s ratepayer benefits be shared with tenants.  Consequently, the Program documents, including the Program Manual, shall be updated with additional explanation of existing programmatic rules.32  Further, moving forward, and consistent with the Program’s existing eligibility requirements, the EDCs shall take additional steps to ensure that multifamily affordable housing projects that are  

31 Sites qualifying as multifamily affordable housing must fall under one of the three definitions listed below:  

Tier I: Multi-family properties with 5 or more units that participate in the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program (“LIHTC”) or that contain a majority of households earning $80\%$ or less of Area Median Income (“AMI”) as set by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”).  

Tier II: Multi-family properties with 5 or more units where more than $66\%$ of the residents have a household income at or below $60\%$ of State Median Income (“SMI”)   
Naturally Occurring Affordable Housing (“NOAH”). Multi-family properties with 5 or more units located in a HUD Qualified Census Tract (“QCT”)., NOAH are considered Tier II.  

Tier III:  Multi-family properties with 5 or more units that apply for review by the Agencies, are determined to meet the eligibility requirements of an affordable multi-family dwelling by the Agencies, and are approved as an affordable housing facility by PURA.  

See EDC Compliance to Order No. 13, Dec. 15, 2022, Docket No. 22-08-02, Attachment 2, p. 7.  

32 The Authority is aware that the current Program Manual prohibits NRES participation at sites eligible for the RRES Program.  EDC Compliance, Mar. 13, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, Attachment 2a, p. 13. Nevertheless, with the participation of multiple multifamily housing projects in the NRES Program, including some that would likely be classified as affordable multifamily housing, the Authority concludes that further clarification is needed in the Program Manual to specify that multifamily affordable housing sites are not eligible for NRES Program participation.  

eligible for the RRES Program do not participate in the NRES Program.33  EDC Compliance, Mar. 13, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-03, Attachment 2a, p. 13.  If a project bid that is either self-identified or easily identifiable34 as multifamily housing is received during a NRES solicitation, the EDCs shall (1) check whether the property is included on either of the most recent Tier I or Tier II RRES multifamily affordable housing lists; and (2) if the property is not on the Tier I or Tier II list, reach out to the bidder to inform them about the NRES and RRES eligibility requirements.  If the EDCs find that the multifamily housing facility qualifies as affordable housing during either step, they shall disqualify the bid and provide the bidder with information on how to apply through the RRES Program.  This process will ensure bidders developing projects at multifamily housing sites are aware of the Program’s eligibility requirements.  Further, this process will ensure that any bids identified as multifamily affordable housing sites still have a clear path forward to be developed at the proposed project sites, while protecting the tenants from potentially receiving an inequitable share of the benefits of such projects.  Finally, the Authority recognizes that, while only a small number of multifamily housing facilities to date have applied for the NRES Program, the process for verifying multifamily housing eligibility could add time and administrative complexity to the NRES Program.  As such, the EDCs may inform the Authority if the number of multifamily housing projects seeking participation in the NRES Program exceeds 20 applications in any single solicitation, so that the above process may be modified to reduce administrative , as necessary.  

# O. CURABLE ERRORS  

The Authority previously identified several circumstances where an application could be cured to prevent project disqualification, including typographical errors, forgetting to attach a required document, and missing or incomplete data.  Year 2 Decision, pp. 29-31.  Upon receipt of application deficiencies, the Authority determined that applicants should have no more than five business days to correct any identified curable errors.  Id., p. 31.  ConnSSA, however, noted that all applications with curable errors were sent by the EDCs to developers at the same time.  ConnSSA Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 7.  Consequently, ConnSSA proposed that the EDCs send applications with curable errors to developers in a “slow rollout,” or a few dozen at time.  Id.  A slow rollout, ConnSSA believed, would be easier for both the EDCs and the industry to manage.  Id.  Additionally, Verogy argued that a five-business day window to cure application errors was unnecessarily short and “could result in otherwise eligible projects being disqualified simply because a Program participant may be simply unavailable during any given week.”  Verogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 19.  As a result, Verogy proposed expanding the cure window to 10 days.  

As noted above, the Authority already adjudicated the process to address curable errors in the Year 2 Decision and, as such, is disinclined to re-adjudicate the matter (or, indeed, any previously settled matter) without compelling evidence that PURA’s prior determination has resulted in a significant impediment to the achievement of the Program Objectives.  No such evidence was provided in this proceeding.  Accordingly, the Authority declines to adopt changes to the curable errors process, including the five-day application cure window, which incentivizes developers to submit complete applications free from substantial errors, thereby supporting the first Program Objective.  However, the Authority urges the EDCs, to the extent practical, to contact developers regarding curable errors on a rolling basis as soon as the EDCs complete their review of the applications, or, at a minimum, in batches, so that developers with multiple curable applications do not have to correct all deficiencies at once, which may be difficult for some developers to accomplish, in furtherance of the first, second, and fourth Program Objectives.  

# P. SOLAR RECYCLING AND WASTE  

In Docket No. 23-08-02, Annual Residential Renewable Energy Solutions Program Review - Year 3, the Authority conducted discovery on the issue of solar panel waste to determine whether proactive steps were needed before solar panel waste becomes a prevalent issue in Connecticut.  The Authority determined that waste may potentially become a problem in the NRES, SCEF, and ESS Programs, in addition to the RRES Program, once commercial solar and batteries reach their end of life.  Consequently, the Authority requested that CGB work in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including DEEP and the EDCs, to develop recommendations to resolve the issue of solar panel and battery recycling and waste for clean energy projects in Connecticut.  RRES Decision, pp. 51-52.  In developing the recommendations, CGB should consider the success or failure of clean energy recycling approaches used in other jurisdictions, a description of the pros and cons of each approach, and an estimate of each approach’s implementation timeline and cost.  If suggested by CGB as an outcome of these collaborative efforts, the Authority would strongly consider creating a new fee, either applied at the time of project application or on an annual basis per developer, across the state’s clean energy programs to cover the costs associated with solar panel and battery recycling.  Last, the Authority requested that CGB provide an update on the stakeholder process, including any recommendations developed, by August 1, 2024.  Id.  Ultimately, while solar panel waste is not yet a prevalent issue in Connecticut, in support of state environmental goals and the Program Objectives, the Authority determines that a solution is needed before the issue becomes commonplace.  

# Q. EDC PROPOSED PROGRAM REDLINES  

In the Year 2 Decision, the Authority directed the EDCs to file annually by August 1 “recommended programmatic changes, and updated Program Manual (both a redline and clean version) . . . Such recommended changes and associated program documents shall be accompanied by a narrative document explaining how the recommended changes better achieve the Program Objectives.”  Year 2 Decision, p. 42.  The EDCs subsequently filed updated Program documents, including an updated Program Manual, in Motion No. 5 in Docket No. 23-08-03.  Upon reviewing the EDCs’ filing and stakeholder comments, the Authority determines that several changes are warranted to the Program documents.  As a result, the Authority directs the EDCs to make additional modifications to the Program documents that are not already addressed in this Decision or the EDCs’ updated Program documents.  More specifically, in this section, the Authority approves the following changes to the Program documents: revisions to the Program’s Rooftop definition, the allowance of project size decreases if several criteria are met, and the allowance of add-on Netting projects for legacy solar systems.  

# 1. Definitional Changes  

# a. Rooftop Definition  

Section 4 of Public Act No. 22-14, An Act Concerning Clean Energy Tariff Programs (P.A. 22-14), allows NRES rooftop systems to utilize a customer’s entire rooftop, regardless of the site’s load.  In written comments, Verogy noted that the current definition of a NRES rooftop project limits such projects to being installed on a single rooftop at a site owned by the customer, instead of multiple rooftops at a single project site, thereby frustrating the intent of P.A. No. 22-14.  Verogy Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 17.  Consequently, the Authority requested written comments from all stakeholders to see whether the “current definition of a rooftop project in the NRES Program satisfies the intent of P.A. 22-14, and whether any changes to the definition are warranted to further the Program Objectives.”  Notice, July 21, 2023, pp. 6-7.  

Verogy elaborated on its June 15 comments by providing a real-world example of the problem created by the current NRES rooftop definition.  Verogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 26.  More specifically, Verogy stated that it evaluated a potential NRES project site with six self-storage buildings and only one revenue meter with a limited load.  Id. Under the current rooftop definition, Verogy could install an oversized system on only one of the six rooftops located at the project site, thereby hindering the intent of P.A. 22-14. Id.  Further, Verogy noted that solar canopies should be included under the rooftop project definition, to allow for system oversizing on land that lacks beneficial use (i.e., packing lots).  Id., p. 27.  Additionally, Ecogy, Independence Solar, and ConnSSA concurred with Vergoy that the current NRES rooftop definition should be expanded to include multiple rooftops on a single project site.  Ecogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 5; Independence Solar Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 1; ConnSSA Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 8.  Last, the EDCs were open to a modified rooftop definition for the NRES Program and suggested the following revised definition, with changes shown in red text:  

“Rooftop Project” shall mean a solar generation Project with $100\%$ of the Nameplate Capacity of the solar photovoltaic modules used for generating power installed on top of either 1) a single building rooftop, or 2) a set of rooftops served by the same revenue meter, at the Project Site owned by the commercial or industrial Customer (i.e., this does not include customers on Residential Rate codes). A Rooftop Project shall not include a Solar Canopy or Solar Carport.  

EDC Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 14.  

Consistent with broad stakeholder support and the intent of P.A. 22-14, the Authority accepts the EDCs’ proposed redlines to the NRES rooftop definition, allowing multiple rooftops at a project site served by a single revenue meter to be considered as one rooftop project for the purposes of system oversizing.  The Authority concludes that such a change will further the first and second Program Objectives by fostering the sustained and orderly development of the state’s Class I renewable energy industry, and by deploying the full MW capacity allowable under statute, through the utilization of the entire available, existing rooftop space for solar production at a project site.  

# b. Brownfield Definition  

In Docket No. 22-08-03, the EDCs proposed a new brownfield definition for the NRES Program to better align the definition with the one used in the SCEF Program. Year 2 Decision, p. 34.  Stakeholders ultimately objected to the EDC-proposed change to the brownfield definition in that proceeding because it was narrower than the current brownfield definition.  Id.  Consequently, the Authority declined to accept the EDCs’ proposed change last year because the Authority was concerned the change would unnecessarily limit the number of locations eligible for the $20\%$ brownfield bid preference, and because the change was proposed late in the annual review process without an opportunity for robust stakeholder input.  Id., pp. 34-35.  Nevertheless, the Authority stated its commitment to addressing this issue in the current annual review docket so that the brownfield definitions for both the NRES and SCEF Programs would be aligned, thereby putting developers on notice that the definitions were subject to change in future program years.  Id., p. 35.  

The Authority, therefore, requested feedback from stakeholders on proposals to align the NRES brownfield definition with definitions used in other state clean energy programs, including SCEF, in addition to a discussion of potential changes to the current NRES brownfield definition.  Notice, June 1, 2023, p. 6.  In response, Independence Solar argued that the Authority should maintain the current NRES brownfield definition. Independence Solar Corresp., June 15, 2023, p. 1.  Similarly, Verogy stated its support for maintaining the current NRES brownfield definition, since the SCEF definition is based on a non-exhaustive list not aligned with past precedent or state statute.  Verogy Comments, June 15, 2023, pp. 10-11.  The SCEF brownfield definition, Verogy noted, should therefore be aligned with the NRES brownfield definition.  Id.  Lodestar also argued against adoption of the SCEF brownfield definition for the NRES Program because the SCEF definition would create uncertainty as to a project’s brownfield bid preference eligibility and because Lodestar believed that DEEP should not be the arbitrator of what qualifies as a brownfield for the NRES Program.  Lodestar Comments, June 16, 2023, p. 4.  Further, Allco recommended that the Authority “include as a brownfield any parcel that would be entitled to the bonus federal investment tax credit” to better coordinate Federal and state brownfield incentives.  Allco Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 3.  Additionally, ConnSSA argued that the NRES brownfield definition should be aligned with the Federal  

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), “with an emphasis on the statutory definition.”  ConnSSA Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 7.  

Moreover, the EDCs recommended alignment of the SCEF and NRES brownfield definitions.  EDC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 13.  Likewise, OCC argued for consistency across both programs’ definitions to reduce “confusion or potentially conflicting outcomes.”  OCC Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 4.  DEEP also advocated for consistency in the SCEF and NRES brownfield definitions and highlighted the benefits of the SCEF definition specifically.  DEEP Comments, June 15, 2023, p. 5.  The SCEF definition, DEEP contended, is less subjective than the statutory definition used for the NRES Program, which makes it easier for participants to prove brownfield bid preference eligibility.  Id.  Further, the SCEF definition requires proof that the “site is abandoned or underutilized because it is contaminated,” thereby ensuring that the bid preference goes to sites “least likely to be developed in any other ways that would benefit the community.” Id.  

The Authority ultimately determines that alignment of the NRES and SCEF brownfield definitions would best serve the NRES Program Objectives, specifically the first and fourth Program Objectives, since such alignment would reduce developer confusion and ensure the orderly development of the state’s Class I renewable energy industry.  However, the Authority remains concerned that different stakeholders participated in the NRES annual review dockets than those who participated in the public process led by DEEP to develop the SCEF brownfield definition and that the stakeholder comments provided to the Authority in the annual clean energy program review proceedings in the past two years reflect different perspectives and conclusions than those reached by DEEP.  See DEEP Corresp., Oct. 7, 2022, Docket No. 22-08-04. Consequently, the Authority respectfully requests that DEEP recommend a new brownfield definition for the NRES Program, consistent with any recommendations made for the SCEF Program, by August 1, 2024.  In so doing, the Authority respectfully requests that DEEP allow for at least one opportunity for stakeholder comment so that stakeholders who previously only participated in PURA’s annual review processes are able to voice their opinions directly to DEEP.  However, the Authority understands that whether any additional process is conducted is at the sole discretion of DEEP.  Ultimately, moving forward, the Authority will defer to DEEP regarding the assessment of brownfield eligibility in both the NRES and SCEF Programs.  As such, the Authority does not plan to solicit comments on DEEP’s August 1, 2024 filing regarding a consistent brownfield definition for the NRES and SCEF Programs.  Ultimately, stakeholders are on notice that the NRES brownfield definition may change at the conclusion of next year’s annual Program review, subject to DEEP’s recommendations, and that any future comments regarding such definition should be directed to DEEP.  

# c. New Construction Definition  

Currently, a New Construction Project is defined as “a Project where there is currently no Customer Revenue Meter at the site, but there will be electric service in the future (i.e., will be located behind a Revenue Meter).”  Verogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 11.  Verogy argued that if the existing definition was taken literally, a project could be precluded from being considered as new construction if any existing revenue meter is located at the project site, even if the tariff customer does not currently have electric service under an existing revenue meter.  Id.  Consequently, Verogy proposed the following revised New Construction Project definition:  

A Project where there is currently no Customer Revenue Meter at the site serving the Tariff Agreement Customer desiring to enter into an NRES Tariff Agreement, but there will be electric service in the future for the potential Tariff Agreement Customer (i.e., will be located behind a Revenue Meter).  

Id., pp. 11-12.  

The EDCs clarified that they have not interpreted the New Construction definition in the manner suggested by Verogy and do not intend to do so in the future.  Eversource Exceptions, Nov. 1, 2023, p. 11; UI Exceptions, Nov. 1, 2023, pp. 16-17.  The EDCs have interpreted the New Construction definition to “mean a new revenue meter [can] be installed for any reason at the project site and have not prohibited entities from claiming New Construction if there is an existing revenue meter located at the project site,” such as in cases of building expansion.  Id.  The EDCs also believe that Verogy’s proposed amendment to the New Construction definition is more restrictive than the EDCs’ current interpretation of the definition because Verogy’s proposed definition, if taken literally, would mean that if a “Customer Revenue Meter exists at the site in the name of the proposed Customer, such Customer cannot claim another New Construction project at the same project site.”  Id.  Consequently, the EDCs recommended no changes to the Program’s New Construction definition.  Id.  

The Authority declines to adopt Verogy’s proposed amendment to the New Construction definition because the Authority concludes that the EDCs’ current interpretation of the New Construction definition adequately encompasses all relevant construction scenarios, including building expansions.  Nevertheless, the Authority determines that the current New Construction definition does not adequately incorporate the EDCs’ existing interpretation of the definition.  Notably, the EDCs’ existing interpretation contradicts a literal reading of the New Construction definition, as described by Verogy.  Consequently, in support of the fourth Program Objective, Program accessibility through simplified Program designs, the Authority directs the EDCs to revise the New Construction definition to explicitly incorporate the EDCs’ existing interpretation of the definition.  

# 2. Project Size Decreases  

Section 5.1.4.3 of the proposed Program Manual states that:  

Any increase or decrease that results in a Project size for a Project which falls outside of the size limits for the category in which the Project was Bid, or which size was modified pursuant to Section 3.5, subject to the five (5) percent variation noted in Section 3.9.2 shall result in immediate and automatic termination of the Project’s eligibility under the Tariff.  

Motion No. 5, Aug. 1, 2023, Attachment 1b, p. 42.  

Verogy argued that if a project needs to decrease in size after a tariff award, it should be allowed to do so provided the tariff award does not change, since the tariff compensation for smaller project categories is greater than larger project categories. Verogy Comments, Aug. 22, 2023, p. 24.  To prevent avoidable project cancellations, and in support of the first and second Program Objectives, the Authority accepts Verogy’s revision to Section 5.1.4.3 with modification.  The EDCs shall no longer cancel projects that decrease in size and that subsequently fall into a different size category, so long as: (1) the size category in which the project ends up has a price cap that is higher than the original project size category; (2) the project bid price is below the highest selected project price in the size category in which the project ends up for that solicitation and that EDC; and (3) the original agreed-upon tariff price remains the same for the project in question.35 The Authority concludes that this additional revision will protect ratepayers by ensuring that projects which decrease in size do not receive higher compensation than what was originally agreed upon, while supporting the first and second Program Objectives, as noted above.  

# 3. Add-On Netting Systems  

The Authority recently approved a modification to the RRES Program Manual to allow RRES customers with existing PV systems to enroll a second PV system in the RRES Netting tariff.  Motion No. 16 Ruling 2, Docket No. 22-08-02.  Previously, residential customers with solar systems installed under traditional net metering could only enroll a second PV system under the RRES Buy-All tariff.  EDC Compliance to Order No. 13, Dec. 15, 2022, Docket No. 22-08-02, Attachment 2, p. 2.  The approved change took effect immediately for Eversource RRES customers.  Motion No. 16 Ruling 2, Docket No. 22- 08-02, p. 1.  For UI RRES customers, however, system upgrades necessary to enable the approved changes are estimated to take seven months.  Id., p. 2.  

Notably, like the original RRES Program Manual, the Year 2 NRES Program Manual prohibits customers with traditional net metering from enrolling new add-on systems in the NRES Netting tariff.  EDC Compliance, March 13, 2023, Docket No. 22- 08-03, Attachment 2b, p. 19.  At the second Technical Meeting, the EDCs further confirmed that customers with existing projects under traditional net metering can currently only enroll new add-on systems in the NRES Buy-All tariff.  Hr’g Tr., Sept. 12, 2023, 55:11-16.  However, if the original project is already enrolled in the NRES Program, an add-on system could enroll in the NRES Netting tariff.  Tr., 55:17-24.  The EDCs cited Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S$ 16-244z as the reason new systems located at traditional net metering sites cannot enroll in the NRES Program under the Netting Tariff, in contrast to the changes approved for the RRES Program.  Tr., 56:1-9.  

As with the RRES Program, allowing new systems incremental to existing clean energy projects taking service under traditional net metering (i.e., add-on systems) to participate in the Netting tariff furthers the Program Objectives as such customers already interact with, and presumably understand, solar project compensation under a netting regime.  Moreover, even if customers are not overly familiar with the net metering compensation structure, providing compensation through two different structures (i.e., traditional net metering for one system and the Buy-All tariff for the other) adds unnecessary complexities to project deployment and customer understanding to the detriment of the fourth Program Objective and, potentially, the first, second, and fifth Program Objectives.  Thus, without evidence that substantial additional ratepayer costs will be incurred by implementation, the Program Objectives will each be furthered or unimpacted by allowing add-on systems under the NRES Netting tariff.  

The Authority understands that, in some instances, allowing add-on systems to take service under the Netting tariff may require projects with traditional net metering (e.g., taking service under Rider N) to be converted from kWh credits to monetary bill credits, as it does in the RRES Program.36  However, based on a preliminary review of the relevant statutes and Motion No. 16 in Docket No. 22-08-02, the Authority does not see such a conversion as equivalent to taking service under the NRES Netting tariff. Specifically, the NRES Netting tariff requires the purchase of the associated RECs.  Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S$ 16-244z(a)(3).  The required change would not require such purchase, nor would such purchase be advisable as the RECs may already be contracted for through the LREC/ZREC Program. Thus, the relevant question would not seem to be whether such conversion is allowed under Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S$ 16-244z, but whether such change conforms with the requirements under Conn. Gen. Stat. $\$16–243h$ .  The Authority’s initial assessment is that the conversion from kWh credits to monetary bill credits is not prohibited by Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S$ 16-243h as the monetary bill credits provide monthly compensation equivalent to the statutorily required kWh value.  Moreover, the annual cash out provision of Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S$ 16-243h would seem to be moot as add-on systems could only be installed under Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S$ 16-244z if additional annual load was not yet being served by clean energy generation as the NRES Program does not allow projects to be sized greater than a customer’s annual load.  Stated another way, it would seem reasonable to assume that the annual cash out provision of Conn. Gen. Stat. $\$16–243h$ does not apply to any existing traditional net metering systems that could accommodate an add-on system.  Last, Conn. Gen. Stat. $\$16–243h$ requires the Authority to set the compensation rate for traditional net metering systems after December 31, 2024; allowing conversion of these specific systems from kWh credits to monetary credits does not appear to be in violation of this requirement.  

Importantly, however, the above analysis still would not allow for new systems to take service solely under a Netting tariff without participating fully in the NRES Program, as discussed in the April 19, 2023 Declaratory Ruling in Docket No. 22-09-09, Declaratory Ruling Regarding Request for Declaratory Relief For Telos Clean Energy, LLC d/b/a Telyon (22-09-09 Ruling):  

The question before the Authority is whether the phrase “until December 31, 2021” in the statute was intended to sunset traditional net metering under Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S$ 16-243h on that date.  The Authority finds in the affirmative.  In short, the plain text of the statute taken in context with other net metering statutes manifests a clear and unambiguous meaning — the General Assembly intended to sunset traditional net metering on December 31, 2021…  

Importantly, the plain meaning rule requires that the subject language be read within “its relationship to other statutes.” Conn. Gen. Stat. $\$1-2z$ . Here, Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S$ 16-244z is particularly relevant because, through it, the General Assembly created a successor program and set of tariffs at precisely the same time it decided to sunset the traditional net metering program and tariff. See P.A. 19-35, $\S\S$ 1 and 3(b) …Consequently, the most reasonable reading of the net metering statutory framework is that the General Assembly terminated traditional net metering in favor of a new, tariff-based net metering program.  

22-09-09 Ruling, p. 4.  In summary, when taken together, Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S\S$ 16-243h and 16-244z make clear that all new clean energy projects are required to fully participate in the NRES Program, which, among other actions, requires the submission of an application during an NRES solicitation and adherence to all NRES Program rules.  

Ultimately, unlike allowing Netting for oversized systems, the practice of allowing add-on systems to participate under the Netting tariff furthers multiple Program Objectives, as discussed above.  However, the Authority recognizes that the above analysis of Conn. Gen. Stat. $\S\S$ 16-243h and 16-244z regarding add-on systems will require careful consideration from the EDCs to ensure that any changes to the Program Manual and other Program documents ensure the effective and efficient enrollment of add-on systems under the NRES Netting tariff.  Consequently, the Authority directs the EDCs to develop and submit for review and approval a plan to allow any new add-on systems to enroll under the NRES Netting tariff in the Year 3 August NRES solicitation by March 15, 2024.37  Further, the EDCs shall allow, to the extent necessary, existing clean energy projects taking service under traditional net metering to convert from kWh credits to monetary credits for the limited purpose of allowing new, add-on systems starting in the Year 3 August NRES solicitation.38  The EDCs’ compliance shall include a clean and redlined version of the proposed changes to the NRES Program Manual.  The EDCs’ compliance filing shall also indicate the costs of implementation, which should not include the costs associated with the similar changes being made in the RRES Program, and an estimated timeline for implementation.  If the Authority determines that the identified costs are significant enough to change the above analysis regarding the achievement of the Program Objectives, the Authority may suspend the allowance of add-on system participation under the NRES Netting tariff.  

# 4. Bid Preference Summary  

A summary of the bid preferences for the NRES Program, in accordance with the existing Program Manual and changes made in this Decision, is included below.  The Authority clarifies that bid preference stacking will not be allowed in the NRES Program at this time, in accordance with the Year 2 Decision.  Year 2 Decision, p. 19.

Further, all recommendations should include a description of the pros and cons of each approach, and an estimate of each approach’s implementation timeline and cost.  The Authority requests that the update, including any recommendations developed, be filed in Docket Nos. 24- 08-02, 24-08-03, 24-08-04, and 24-08-05.  

# 2.    New Orders  

18. No later than December 15, 2023, the EDCs shall file for Authority review and approval in this proceeding updated NRES Program documents, including the Program Manual and an updated Netting Calculator, incorporating all of the approved modifications authorized in this Decision.  Such filing shall include both a clean and a redlined version of all NRES Program documents.  

19. No later than December 15, 2023, the EDCs shall file as compliance with the Authority in this proceeding a Consumer Protection and Disclosure Form, to ensure that NRES customers are not subject to deceptive marketing practices or solar agreements.  The Consumer Protection and Disclosure Form may be modeled after the existing forms used for the RRES Program.  The form shall be required for all future NRES bids, beginning with the Year 3 August solicitation.  

20. Reference Decision, Feb. 22, 2023, Docket No. 22-08-01, 2022 Clean and Renewable Energy Program Data and Report, pp. 4-5: No later than January 5, 2024, and annually thereafter, the EDCs shall provide an updated Frequently Asked Question document and Fact Sheet for the NRES Program that reflects the program modifications as directed in the most recent Final Decision issued through the NRES Program Annual Review proceeding, Docket No. XX-08-03.  

21. No later than February 1, 2024, UI shall file as compliance a list of reasons, supported by both qualitative and quantitative evidence, outlining why line side interconnections for NRES projects should not be approved in UI service territory in a manner similar to Eversource.  

22. No later than February 1, 2024, the EDCs shall assign a single point of contact for all interconnection matters related to each NRES project, to alleviate developer confusion over the NRES interconnection process.  Additionally, contact information for the single point of contact for each project shall be made available to the relevant NRES project developer upon request.  

23. No later than February 1, 2024, the EDCs shall file in this proceeding for Authority review and approval a plan for better coordination between all departments involved in the NRES interconnection approval process, to alleviate costly misunderstandings between the numerous EDC departments involved in the NRES interconnection review process.  The plan shall clearly outline the steps each EDC will take to ensure all EDC departments are in agreement during the interconnection review process, so that interconnection approvals or communications with developers are not contradicted by another EDC department.  

24. No later than March 15, 2024, the EDCs shall develop and submit for review and approval a plan to allow any new add-on systems to enroll under the NRES Netting tariff in the Year 3 August NRES solicitation following the direction and in line with the analysis provided in Section IV.Q.3.  The EDCs’ compliance shall include a clean and redlined version of the proposed changes to the NRES Program Manual.  The EDCs’ compliance filing shall also indicate the costs of implementation, which should not include the costs associated with the similar changes being made in the RRES Program, and an estimated timeline for implementation.  

25. No later than June 1, 2024, the EDCs shall update the Program documents for the August 2024 solicitation to include the new agricultural requirements outlined in Section IV.L.1, and file such documents as compliance with the Authority.  

26. No later than June 1, 2024, the EDCs shall file for Authority review and approval, a draft contract whereby the NRES customer can purchase and retire the RECs associated with the customer’s project from the EDC, in Docket Nos. 23-08-03 and 24-08-03.  Such contract shall be separate and distinct from any existing NRES tariffs or agreements (i.e., such contract should supplement existing documents, as the REC transaction between the EDC and customer will occur after the EDC has already purchased the RECs via the NRES Program).  Further, for projects intending to utilize the REC buyback option, the upfront administrative costs of implementing such a transaction shall be added to the project’s application fee.  

27. No later than June 1, 2024, the EDCs shall file as compliance the estimated administrative costs per project associated with allowing REC buybacks for NRES customers in Docket Nos. 23-08-03 and 24-08-03.  

28. No later than June 1, 2024, the EDCs shall file as compliance the competitive RFP results for completing the hosting capacity map upgrades outlined in this Decision, including a comparison of timelines and cost estimates for completing the proposed hosting capacity map upgrades internally versus a third party, and a narrative explanation as to how each Company has ensured the least-cost implementation, both in the near- and long-term, of the hosting capacity map upgrades provisionally approved in this Decision.  The RFP shall follow all guidance included in Section IV.H.1.  Further, the compliance shall include updated, itemized costs of implementing the upgrades both externally and internally, including costs broken out by upfront and recurring costs, to the fullest extent possible.  The EDCs shall file such compliance for Authority review and approval in Docket Nos. 24-08-03 and 17-12-03RE06.  Finally, no later than June 1, 2024, the EDCs shall present the updated timeline and cost estimates of their proposed upgrades to a meeting of the Interconnection Working Group.  

29. No later than June 1, 2024, the EDCs shall file as compliance in Docket No. 24- 08-03 new NRES application fees to take effect during the Year 3 August solicitation to cover $50\%$ of the cost of an independent ombudsperson, as outlined in Section IV.I, and the administrative costs associated with running the NRES Program.  If the revenues from the current nonrefundable NRES application fees exceed the cost of administering the NRES Program plus $50\%$ of the cost of the ombudsperson, the EDCs shall state so in their compliance and shall not increase current NRES application fees.  

30. No later than June 1, 2024, the EDCs shall file for the Authority’s review and approval in Docket No. 24-08-03 a potential alternative procurement plan for joint solicitations among the competitive NRES project categories.  The potential alternative joint procurement plan for implementing joint solicitations shall include a methodology for allocation of costs and benefits of selected NRES projects among the EDCs and at least one option for allowing SAM projects to designate beneficial accounts in either EDC service territory.  Further, the potential alternative joint procurement plan shall identify any potential barriers to implementation and propose solutions to the identified barriers.  Additionally, the current $80-20\%$ split for both EDCs shall remain in place for the small zero emission project category.  In developing the procurement plan, the EDCs shall collaborate with the ombudsperson authorized in Section IV.I.  Ultimately, the proposed, alternative plan must be provided in the form of redline edits to the current Program Manual and accompanied by a document inclusive of (1) an explanation of the proposed redline edits and (2) the requirements outlined in Section IV.C.1.  

31. No later than August 1, 2024, the Authority requests that DEEP recommend a new brownfield definition for the NRES Program, consistent with any recommendations made for the SCEF Program, by August 1, 2024.  In so doing, the Authority requests that DEEP allow for at least one opportunity for stakeholder comment so that stakeholders who previously only participated in PURA’s annual review processes are able to voice their opinions to DEEP.  

32. No later than August 1, 2024, and annually thereafter, each EDC shall file as compliance in the most recent annual review docket (i.e., in 2024, Docket No. 24- 08-04) a NRES Interconnection Report.  The Report shall consist of a summary of the state of interconnection for all approved NRES projects to date and shall include, at a minimum, (1) the interconnection status of each NRES project; (2) the EDC interconnection approval due date for each project per approved interconnection guidelines; (3) the number of days from when all required interconnection materials were submitted to the utility for each project to interconnection approval, or to when the data was pulled for the report, if interconnection approval has not been granted; (4) the date for which data was pulled for the report; (5) the project attrition rate; (6) a list of the most common reasons for interconnection delays; and (7) EDC-proposed solutions for each of the most common reasons delaying interconnection.  

33. No later than August 1, 2024, and annually thereafter, the EDCs shall file in the current annual review docket (i.e., in 2024, Docket No. 24-08-04) the average annual customer savings for each kilowatt of solar installed for all Distressed Municipality projects using the information provided by the Consumer Protection and Disclosure Form.  

34. No later than August 1, 2025, and annually thereafter for the duration of the NRES Program, the Authority directs each EDC to file in the most recent NRES annual review docket (i.e., in 2025, Docket No. 25-08-03) an updated proposed nonrefundable application fee to cover the administrative costs associated with running the NRES Program, based on the most recent application numbers and administrative cost data.  The filing shall include a total estimate of all NRES administrative costs for the prior year, in addition to the total nonrefundable fees collected by each EDC via NRES Program applications.  

35. As soon as practicable after approval, the ombudsman shall file as compliance any approved extension requests, including whether each request was granted or denied, in the NRES annual review docket related to the solicitation year in which the project was selected (e.g., Docket No. 22-08-03 if the project was selected in Year 2 of the Program, i.e., calendar year 2023).  The ombudsman shall also annually file a summary of any extension request denials in the relevant NRES proceeding by August 1.
