 ## Summary : 
 S.B. 802 of 2024 authorized the establishment of a statewide Commercial
Property Assessed Capital Expenditure (C-PACE) program that local governments
may voluntarily join. Eligible properties include commercial, industrial,
agricultural, nonprofit, and multifamily residential properties with five or
more dwelling units. The bill establishes the [Economic Development
Partnership of North Carolina](https://edpnc.com/) as the statewide
administrator for the program and assigns a variety of tasks to it:

  * Prepare a C-PACE toolkit, as described in S.B. 802, in consultation with stakeholders and local governments
  * Impose fees to offset the actual and reasonable costs of administering the C-PACE Program, including an application fee not to exceed $750, and a processing fee equal to 1% of the financed amount not to exceed $25,000
  * Establish the process for reviewing and evaluating applications
  * Accept and approve project applications for C-PACE financing

A local government seeking to participate in the C-PACE program must first
adopt a resolution meeting the criteria detailed in S.B. 802. C-PACE liens
must be inferior to all prior and subsequent State, local, and federal taxes
or liens and superior to all other liens on the property from the date on
which the notice of the C-PACE assessment is recorded.

The term of the C-PACE financing may not exceed the weighted average useful
life of qualifying improvements, and the total amount of financing cannot
exceed 35% of the value of the property. The exact financing agreement between
the capital provider and the property owner will be negotiated by the parties,
including all terms and conditions of repayment, interest, penalties, and
prepayment conditions. Prior to entering into an assessment agreement, the
property owner must submit to the statewide administrator a written statement,
executed by each holder of a mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien on the
property securing indebtedness, indicating their consent to the C-PACE
assessment
