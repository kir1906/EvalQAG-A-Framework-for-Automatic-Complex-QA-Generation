 ## Summary : 
 The City of San Antonio's [Under 1
Roof](https://www.sa.gov/Directory/Departments/NHSD/Housing-Support/Repair)
program provides eligible homeowners with funding opportunities to assist in
the replacement of worn and damaged shingles with new, energy-efficient white
shingle roofs and solar underlayment. The program provides a one-time grant
and the City of San Antonio will place a restrictive covenant on the property
requiring homeowners to maintain ownership and occupancy for five years after
project completion.  

Homes larger than 1,700 sq. ft. are subject to approval based on cost
assessment and needs of the home. Metal roofs, gravel roofs, clay tiles and
wood shingles are subject to additional review and may not be eligible. If
insured, homeowner must not have received insurance payout for full roof
replacement claims in the last five years.
