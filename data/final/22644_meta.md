 ## Summary : 
 **_Note: The[Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf#page=993)
created the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/) with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

Indiana issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity for NEVI funding in August
2023; awardees for 39 sites were selected in Winter 2024 in this first round
of funding. Additional details are available in the [Indiana Electric Vehicle
Infrastructure Deployment Plan](https://www.in.gov/indot/files/CLEAN_INDOT-EV-
Deployment-Plan_2023-10-04_Revised.pdf).
