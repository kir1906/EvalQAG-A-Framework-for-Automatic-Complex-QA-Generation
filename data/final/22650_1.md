# Wisconsin Electric Vehicle Infrastructure  

While EVs have existed for years, the increased emphasis on this potentially transformative technology will have exciting and significant impacts to Wisconsin's economy, workforce, and transportation system in the years to come.   
WisDOT's mission is to provide leadership in the development and operation of a safe and efficient transportation system. As EVs continue to alter the status quo of the transportation system, WisDOT will continue to collaborate with government, industry, and the public to create innovative transportation solutions that meet the needs of our state and contribute to the health and well-being of our communities.  

"There is a growing demand for sustainable transportation options in Wisconsin and WisDOT is committed to keeping up with those needs. We are making great progress in our efforts to build out a reliable electric vehicle charging infrastructure in every corner of the state to help drivers get to school, work and appointments. We are thrilled to provide this essential service to commuters, travelers and visitors while supporting local businesses long into the future."  

- Secretary Kristina Boardman

Round 1.5 of the WEVI Program focuses on building out the rest of the gaps in Wisconsin's Alternative Fuel Corridor system in order to achieve fully-built out status. The Evaluation Zones and Priority Locations Interactive Map provides information for potential applicants on the 13 coverage gaps that WisDOT is looking to fill in Round 1.5.  

If the WEVI program does not meet your needs or interests, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has designated $\$2.5$ billion in funding outside of the NEVI Program for EV charging stations. These opportunities include the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program and the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Tax Credit.
