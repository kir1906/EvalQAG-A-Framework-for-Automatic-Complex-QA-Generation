The aggregate net metering capacity of net metering facilities of a municipality or other governmental entity shall not exceed 8 per cent of the distribution company's peak load. The maximum amount of generating capacity eligible for net metering by a municipality or other governmental entity shall be 10 megawatts. For the purpose of calculating the aggregate capacity, the capacity of a solar net metering facility shall be 80 per cent of the facility's direct current rating at standard test conditions and the capacity of a wind net metering facility or an anaerobic digestion net metering facility shall be the nameplate rating. 
 
(g) The department shall adopt rules and regulations necessary to carry out this section, including adoption of a system that provides proposed net metering facilities of a municipality or other governmental entity an assurance of net metering eligibility at the time the facilities meet criteria established by the department. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the department's authority to adopt rules and regulations relating to other proposed net metering facilities. 
 
(h) A municipality or other governmental entity that is a member of a cooperative corporation, organized under section 136, that is comprised solely of municipalities or other governmental entities, may transfer any or all of the net metering generating capacity associated with a facility, or facilities, as specified in subsection (f) to said cooperative corporation by providing written assent to the cooperative corporation and obtaining approval from the department. Such a cooperative corporation may serve as a host customer, as defined in 220 CMR 18.02, for net metering facilities of municipalities or other governmental entities for all such allocated capacity and its own allocation of capacity as an other governmental entity; provided, that the net metering credits for which such cooperative serves as host customer shall only be allocated to such cooperative or its members. Such cooperative shall not be considered an electric company, generation company, aggregator, supplier, energy marketer or energy broker, as those terms are defined in sections 1 and 1F. 
 
(i) A Class I net metering facility shall be exempt from subsections (b1/2) and (k) and from the aggregate net metering capacity of facilities that are not net metering facilities of a municipality or other governmental entity under subsection (f) and may net meter and accrue Class I net metering credits if it is generating renewable energy and the nameplate capacity of the facility is equal to or less than 25 kilowatts. A Class I net metering facility with a capacity greater than 25 kilowatts, Class II net metering facility or Class III net metering facility with an executed interconnection agreement with a distribution company on or after January 1, 2021 shall be exempt from the aggregate net metering capacity of facilities that are not net metering facilities of a municipality or other governmental entity under subsection (f) and may net meter and accrue Class I, Class II, or Class III market net metering credits if it is generating renewable energy and serves on-site load other than parasitic or station load; provided, that any credits accrued in excess of its annual electricity consumption for the period running from April through the following March shall be credited or paid out for such excess credits at the utility's avoided cost rate. 
 
(j) Distribution companies may submit to the department proposals for a monthly minimum reliability contribution to be included on electric bills for distribution utility accounts that receive Class I, Class II, Class III, or market net metering credits pursuant to this section, subject to the review and approval of the department. Any such minimum contributions shall ensure that all distribution company customers contribute to the fixed costs of ensuring the reliability, proper maintenance and safety of the electric distribution system; provided, however, that a distribution company may assess a demand charge if it is based on system peak demand during the hours of a day determined to be peak hours of system demand and if the distribution company regularly informs affected customers of the manner in which demand charges are assessed and of ways in which said customers might manage and reduce demand. Proposals shall be filed with the department in: (i) the distribution company's base distribution rate proceeding; or (ii) a revenue neutral rate design filing that is supported by appropriate cost of service data across all rate classes. The department may approve a monthly minimum reliability contribution that: (i) equitably allocates the fixed costs of the electric distribution system not caused by volumetric consumption; (ii) does not excessively burden ratepayers; (iii) does not unreasonably inhibit the development of Class I, Class II, Class III facilities; and (iv) is dedicated to offsetting reasonably and prudently incurred costs necessary to maintain the reliability, proper maintenance and safety of the electric distribution system. 
 
The department may only approve a proposal for a monthly minimum reliability contribution after the aggregate nameplate capacity of installed solar generating facilities in the commonwealth is equal to or greater than 1,600 megawatts. The department shall conduct a full adjudicatory proceeding when reviewing proposals for a monthly minimum reliability contribution, which shall include at least 1 public hearing and an opportunity for public comment. 
 
The department may exempt or modify any monthly minimum reliability contribution for low-income ratepayers. The department may also exempt, for any period through the year 2020, any class or sub-class of Class I, Class II, or Class III net metering facilities that were in service not later than December 31, 2016 from any minimum reliability contribution. Minimum monthly reliability contributions shall take effect on such date designated by the department. The department may approve changes to the monthly minimum reliability contributions for individual electric distribution companies in any future base distribution rate proceeding, consistent with this section. 
 
(k) A Class I, Class II or Class III solar net metering facility, as defined in section 138 and this section, shall continue to receive Class I, Class II or Class III net metering credits as otherwise provided by this section if such facility is determined to be so eligible prior to the date of notification as determined pursuant to subsection (b1/2), that the aggregate nameplate capacity of solar generating capacity in the commonwealth is equal to or greater than 1,600 megawatts; provided, however, that 25 years from the date upon which the Class I, Class II or Class III solar net metering facility was authorized to interconnect to the distribution system by a distribution company, the facility shall receive market net metering credits. 
 
(l) A Class I, Class II or Class III solar net metering facility shall be eligible to, or shall continue to, receive net metering credits as otherwise provided by this section if such facility is on the same parcel as any number of other such solar net metering facilities and if: (i) the net metering facilities are placed on a government-owned parcel; provided, however, that all facilities on the single parcel do not exceed an aggregate limit of 10 megawatts; (ii) the net metering facilities are placed on a single parcel of land where all buildings on that parcel comprise low or moderate income housing as defined in section 20 of chapter 40B; provided, however, that all facilities on the single parcel do not exceed an aggregate limit of 10 megawatts; (iii) each net metering facility is placed on a separate and distinct rooftop where no 2 systems occupy the same rooftop; provided, however, that all facilities on the single parcel do not exceed an aggregate limit of 2 megawatts; (iv) each net metering facility installed on the same rooftop is interconnected behind a meter of a separate customer; provided, however, that all the facilities on the single parcel do not exceed an aggregate limit of 10 megawatts; or (v) the additional net metering facilities are installed not less than 1 year after any previously installed facility was placed into service; provided, however, that all facilities on the single parcel do not exceed an aggregate limit of 2 megawatts. If all the net metering facilities located on a single parcel are net metering facilities of a municipality, the aggregate limit shall be 10 megawatts per single parcel. For purposes of this subsection, a solar net metering facility installed as a canopy over a parking area shall be considered to be installed on a rooftop. 

Section 139A. (a) For the purposes of this section, the following words shall have the following meanings unless the context clearly requires otherwise:— 
 
''Small hydroelectric power net metering facility'', a facility with a nameplate capacity of 2 megawatts or less, using water to generate electricity that is connected to a distribution company. 
 
''Small hydro tariff'', the default service kilowatt-hour rate of the local distribution company as defined in section 1 that receives electricity from a small hydropower facility or an anaerobic digestion net metering facility. 
 
(b) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the department may require the electric distribution companies to amend the net metering tariff to create a program for small hydroelectric power net metering facilities in the commonwealth. An electric distribution company shall pay a small hydroelectric power net metering facility monthly for electricity it received from the facility based on the kilowatt hours of electricity that the distribution company received from the facility multiplied by the small hydro tariff. A participating small hydroelectric net metering facility shall notify a distribution company that it intends to deliver electricity pursuant to the small hydro tariff program and shall comply with the distribution company's applicable reporting and interconnection requirements; provided, however that no more than 60 megawatts of small hydroelectric power aggregate capacity statewide shall be permitted to participate in the small hydroelectric power tariff program. The department shall determine an appropriate and proportionate method of allocating costs of small hydropower facilities to ensure that the costs of the program are shared collectively among all ratepayers of the distribution companies. 

Section 140. A neighborhood net metering facility shall elect net metering as follows: 
 
(a) If the electricity generated by the neighborhood net metering facility during a billing period exceeds its kilowatt-hour usage during the billing period, the neighborhood net metering facility shall be billed for 0 kilowatt-hour usage and the excess neighborhood net metering credits shall be credited to those customers identified by the neighborhood net metering facility as being served by the same company to which the neighborhood net metering facility is interconnected, residing in the same neighborhood in which the neighborhood net metering facility is located and having an ownership interest in the neighborhood net metering facility. The amount of the excess neighborhood net metering credits to be attributed to each such customer shall be determined by the allocation provided by the neighborhood net metering facility. Credits may be carried forward by such customers from month to month. Written notice of the identity of the customers so designated and the allocation of the credits to be attributed to such customers shall be in such form as the distribution company shall reasonably require. 
 
(b) The department shall adopt rules and regulations necessary to carry out this section, including, but not limited to, further defining the term ''neighborhood'' and limiting the number of customers that may be designated by neighborhood net metering facilities to receive neighborhood net metering credits.
