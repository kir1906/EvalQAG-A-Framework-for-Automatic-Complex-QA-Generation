# Section 2: Summary  

Energy Storage Solutions, herein known as the “Program”, is a voluntary incentive program offered to the residential, commercial, and industrial customers of The Connecticut Light and Power Company d/b/a Eversource Energy (Eversource) or The United Illuminating Company (UI) who are considering on-site energy storage solutions. The purpose of the following sections is to outline the purpose, requirements, steps, and expectations of the key parties involved in the application and incentive process. This document will also serve as a basis for compliance with the decision as listed below. The Program Administrators may submit written request to PURA to modify the Program Manual or other Program guidelines and procedures at an appropriate time.  

On July 28, 2021, the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (Authority) issued a final decision in Docket No. 17-12-03RE03, PURA Investigation into Distribution System Planning of the Electric Distribution Companies – Electric Storage (Decision) establishing a nine-year electric storage program, which shall be available to all customers and customer classes within the service territories of Eversource and UI, collectively, the electric distribution companies (EDCs). 2 The Decision also establishes the EDCs and the Connecticut Green Bank (CGB) as Program Administrators. The Authority’s goal in the proceeding was to develop and implement a program for battery energy storage systems (BESS) connected to the electric distribution system that would provide multiple types of benefits to the grid, including ancillary services, peak shaving, support for the deployment of other distributed energy resources, and customer, local, or community resilience.  

In the Decision, PURA identified seven key objectives for the Program, including:  

1. Provide positive net present value to all ratepayers.  

2. Provide multiple types of benefits to the electric grid (e.g., customer, local, or community resilience, ancillary services, peak shaving, avoiding or deferring distribution system upgrades, or supporting the deployment of other distributed energy resources).   
3. Foster the sustained, orderly development of a state-based electric energy storage industry.   
4. Prioritize delivering increased resilience to low-and-moderate income customers, customers in environmental justice or economically distressed communities 3 , medical hardship customers, residents living in public housing, customers on the grid-edge who consistently experience more and/or longer than average outages during major storms, and critical facilities.   
5. Lower the barriers to entry, financial or otherwise, for electric storage deployment in Connecticut.   
6. Maximize the long-term environmental benefits of electric storage by reducing emissions associated with fossil-based peaking generation.   
7. Maximize the benefits to ratepayers derived from the wholesale capacity market.  

Residential and commercial and industrial customers of Eversource and UI are eligible to participate in the Program, with the Authority’s end goal of deploying 580 megawatts (MW) of electric storage by 2030, allocated between residential and commercial and industrial customer classes as shown below4:

The Program consists of two key elements:  

Passive Dispatch: pre-scheduled by the Operator of Eligible BESS per program rules to 1) dispatch energy during established Passive event periods and 2) be overridden by the EDCs for Active Dispatch events or  BESS Operators for weather-related or emergency situations. Compensated by an upfront incentive administered by CGB. Customers enrolled in Passive Dispatch are automatically also enrolled in Active Dispatch.  

Active Dispatch: managed by the EDCs, which compensates participants for the average kW7 dispatched during events over the summer and winter seasons. Compensated by a performancebased incentive structure administered by the EDCs. Customers may opt-out of Active Dispatch events on a per-event basis only. Opt-out methods are to be determined by the BESS Operator (i.e. via text message, web interface, app interface, etc.).  

Customer participation benefits and requirements will be determined by Customer Class as detailed below. Please refer to Section 6 in this Program Manual for detailed participation requirements for Passive and Active demand response incentive attainment.

Equipment cannot be simultaneously enrolled in Energy Storage Solutions and ConnectedSolutions. Customers may enroll separate equipment in both Programs if desired (i.e. one BESS with legacy enrollment in ConnectedSolutions and, if technically feasible, a second BESS enrolled in ESS). ConnectedSolutions has ended new enrollments as of December 1st, 2023.

# Section 3: Enrollment  

Customers will be able to enroll in Energy Storage Solutions via their Eligible Contractor (Contractor) or Third-Party Owner (TPO) completing a project application (Application) on the Customer’s behalf through an approved Enrollment Platform. The Customer’s Contractor or TPO will be responsible for submitting the Customer’s Application to the appropriate Program Administrator and the Customer and/or Contractor or TPO will be responsible for registering the BESS into the relevant EDC’s Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS). Alternatively, Customers may self-enroll via their BESS OEM, Operator, or Aggregator as described in Sec. 3.2.1 below. The time period allocated to complete each enrollment milestone will differ depending on the type of the Customer (commercial or residential) and the size of the project.  

In the event that an Application is submitted for upfront or performance-based incentives that are outside the scope of use case examples within the Program Manual, or that were not discussed or presented within the regulatory process, then the Program Administrators have discretion to determine the appropriate incentive consistent with the public policy objectives of PURA.  

# 3.1. Customer Enrollment Process—New Active and Passive Dispatch  

The following steps outline the expected process flow for customer enrollment into Energy Storage Solutions, from Application to the verification of system operation and the onset of performance period.  

# 1. Execute Customer Contract or LOI, Terms & Conditions and Data Release  

Residential Customers must sign and execute a Customer Contract, Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), or Lease Agreement with an Eligible Contractor and/or Third Party Owner (TPO), noting the designation of associated parties responsible for administration of the project. The Customer Contract, PPA, or Lease Agreement must comply with the requirements set forth in Sec. 4.3.  

C&I Customers may sign a Letter of Intent (LOI) rather than a complete contract at the Application stage.  

Residential Customers must agree to and sign the Residential Customer Terms & Conditions and Data Release associated with their Eligible Equipment or BESS Operator. Example included in Appendix $\mathsf{B}^{15}$ .  

C&I Customers must agree to and sign the Commercial and Industrial Customer Terms and Conditions and Data Release included in Appendix $\Game^{16}$ .  

# 2. Submit Interconnection Application  

For all Program applications, the Contractor or TPO must submit a completed Interconnection Application to the applicable EDC in order to receive a Reservation of Funds letter. Projects should be interconnected with exporting capabilities where not costprohibitive to the customer. Commercial and industrial customers with base load17 higher than the BESS maximum dispatch capability may also be exempted from exporting requirements.  

# 3. Complete Customer Enrollment Application  

Customers seeking participation in Energy Storage Solutions must be first deemed eligible. The Contractor or TPO must register their respective Customers using an approved  

Enrollment Platform to complete the Application. The Contractor or TPO will follow instructions on the Enrollment Platform to submit a complete Application.  

Communications and notifications for activity throughout the process will be sent via email to the email addresses on file in the Application.  

To be considered complete, each Application will include, but may not be limited to, the following information submitted directly or via attached files in the Enrollment Platform:  

a. Customer, Contractor, and TPO (if applicable) detailed contact and site information   
b. Service address where BESS is to be installed   
c. Designation of incentive recipient (default is system owner) and point of contact responsible for Application accuracy   
d. Signed Customer Contract or LOI for BESS i. For Residential projects, a signed sales agreement, lease, or power purchase agreement between the Customer and Contractor or TPO is required. ii. For C&I projects, a signed Letter of Intent (LOI) between the Customer and Contractor or TPO will be accepted during the initial application stage to receive a ROF.  

e. System description (make, model, and quantity of battery and inverter)  

f. Signed Program Terms & Conditions and Data Release  

# 4. Program Administrators Review Project for Eligibility and Technical Accuracy  

After Application submittal, Program Administrator staff will review the Application for accuracy and completeness. If additional information is needed, Contractor or TPO will be notified via email of any deficiencies. The Applicant may be given a time frame to correct such deficiencies, as indicated in an email communication. If after this extended time the Applicant has not provided the requested information, Program Administrators may elect to move the incentive application to an “inactive” status. Applicants may reapply at any time subject to Program availability.  

# 5.  Program Administrator Approves Project Application and Upfront Incentive  

All C&I Projects with an estimated upfront incentive below $\$500,000$ require a Project Approval Form (PAF) that must be approved by all Green Bank Senior Staff. All projects with an estimated upfront incentive greater than or equal to $\$500,000$ will require approval from the Connecticut Green Bank Board of Directors (BOD). Upon all Application requirements being satisfied, including applicable PAF or BOD approvals, Green Bank staff will electronically send a Reservation of Funds (ROF) letter describing the estimated upfront incentive (where applicable), the milestone approval process and dates, and the expiration date of the fund reservation.  

All residential projects shall have up to 24 months to reach operation upon issuance of Reservation of Funds. Program Administrators may approve extension requests beyond 24 months if the extension criteria below are met.  

For commercial projects, Program Administrators may approve extension requests beyond 24 months (if no System Impact Study) or 36 months (if the first extension request was granted) if the extension criteria below are met.  

# Extension Criteria  

Program Administrators may approve additional extension requests depending on the project’s demonstrated need for an extension. Program Administrators may grant a second extension request if at least one of the following five criteria are met: (1) the generation facility or project is unique and more complex than ordinary customer-sided distributed generation installation projects, such as having additional technology-specific regulatory or local siting requirements; (2) the project developer has worked diligently and in good faith in developing the project since inception; (3) the project is near completion or likely to begin commercial operation within the requested extended deadline; (4) a significant portion of the total project investment has already been made and would potentially be stranded if the contract is terminated; and/or (5) the interconnection process extended beyond the utilities’ initial estimates and/or significantly (e.g., one month) beyond the average interconnection process timeline.  

It should be noted that extension requests will prolong the project completion deadline proportional to the delay experienced and/or the amount of time demonstrated that is needed to complete the project.  

Extension requests should be submitted via email to energystorage@ctgreenbank.com with the subject line “Extension Request: ESS-#####18” and will be reviewed on a per-project basis by Program Administrators.  

# 6. Construction Phase  

The Contractor or TPO may pursue the construction schedule that best suits the project needs, although the Program Administrators anticipate that the majority of projects will not begin construction until the Customer Contract has been executed19. Upon construction completion and within the  allowable timeframe if the extensions are granted, the Contractor or TPO will notify the Program Administrators of the commercial operation date (COD) via the Customer Enrollment Platform and that the system is ready for verification via submission of project completion materials in the Enrollment Platform. Connection to any building’s electrical service or utility meter can only be performed by a licensed Connecticut E-1.  

# 7. Inspection  

Battery inspections are optional and inspections will be conducted only upon customer request. Customers interested in having their batteries inspected must indicate their  

preference by opting in during the incentive application process, and the inspection will take place after the project is built and submitted for completion.  

# 8. Battery Enrollment  

As part of the Construction Phase, the Eligible Contractor or other party responsible for installation of the BESS will enroll the BESS in the relevant DERMS platform. The method by which this is performed will vary depending on the BESS OEM or Operator. Once successfully enrolled, the Program Administrators will be able to confirm that the BESS is operational through the DERMS portal.  

# 9. Approval and Payment of Upfront Incentive  

Upon confirmation that the system is energized and operational, has passed all applicable inspections (if opted-in), has received final approval from the EDC, and is reporting in the appropriate DERMS platform, a Confirmation of Funds letter will be issued by the Program Administrators confirming the final approved Upfront Incentive amount. The Upfront Incentive will be approved for payment as described in Section 6. The project will be considered “Complete” and operational at this point to begin its 10-year enrollment period.  

# 3.2. Customer Enrollment Process – New Active Dispatch Only  

Customers who wish to enroll in Active Dispatch only (and forego the Upfront Incentive) may do so through multiple channels. Enrollment in Active-Only dispatch should be done after the system is installed, operational, has received utility approval to energize, and is connected to the relevant DERMS platform.  

# 3.2.1 BESS Operator, BESS Aggregator, or OEM-Led Enrollment  

Customers who wish to self-enroll in Active Dispatch only via the web or app interfaces provided by their BESS Operator, BESS Aggregator, or OEM (In-App Enrollment) may do so, following the instructions provided in the interface. The Program Administrators reserve the right to grant or revoke the ability for BESS Operators, Aggregators, and OEMs to enroll customers via this channel.  

# 1. Execute Customer Terms & Conditions and Data Release  

Residential Customers must agree to and sign the Residential Customer Terms & Conditions and Data Release associated with their Eligible Equipment or BESS Operator or Aggregator. Example included in Appendix B.  

C&I Customers must agree to and sign the Commercial and Industrial Customer Terms and Conditions and Data Release included in Appendix G.  

This may be done directly within the In-App Enrollment process.  

# 2. Complete Customer Enrollment Application  

Customers will follow a process for In-App Enrollment managed by the BESS Operator, Aggregator, or OEM and approved by the Program Administrators.  

To be considered complete, each Application will include, but may not be limited to, the following information:

Upon verification of eligibility, the Program Administrators will work with the EDCs and the appropriate DERMS provider to transfer the customer’s enrollment into Energy Storage Solutions. The customer will receive a Welcome Letter via email confirming the transfer.  

# 3.4. Enrollment Deadlines and Milestones  

Customers may enroll at any time for a period of ten (10) full years. See Section 6.1 for more information.  

# 3.5. Project Verification  

# 3.5.1. Project Inspections  

To qualify for an upfront incentive, Contractors or TPOs must agree to provide the Program Administrators with a Self-Inspection report (including all required photos) at project completion, along with all other project completion paperwork. The Program Administrators will review SelfInspection report submission and follow up with the Contractor or TPO as needed. Contractors or TPOs will submit Self-Inspection reports via the Energy Storage Solutions Enrollment Platform in accordance with guidelines described in the current Process Guides.  

A copy of the Third-Party Inspection Checklist is posted at the Energy Storage Solutions website for reference when a customer elects to have their project inspected.  

The Program Administrators reserve the right to have a representative of the Program Administrator conduct a field inspection of the completed system to verify information submitted in the selfinspection report and Application materials, as well as inspect the system with respect to: battery system communication status to assure that the battery can dispatch to meet Program requirements as well as meet customer backup power needs, equipment verification, safety considerations, workmanship, and other considerations such as local and state codes, laws and regulations (though adherence to applicable codes are primarily the purview of municipal inspections). Contractors or TPOs must allow this representative to inspect the completed and interconnected BESS, though Customers may decline the Inspection if they choose. Contractor or TPO and Customer will have the right to be present for the Program Administrators’ Field Inspection as safety allows and at the discretion of the inspector. The Program Administrators and inspectors will coordinate inspection following Contractor or TPO’s submission of proof of project completion if Host Customer opted into a Third-Party Inspection.  

Upon the second instance of a re-inspection at one (1) or more sites, the Contractor or TPO may be required to pay the costs of follow-up inspection.  

Discrepancies found between incentive applications and inspection reports will be reviewed by the Program Administrators. The Program Administrators reserve the right to adjust Upfront Incentive calculations based on inspection reports or other submitted documentation and will make a final decision on upfront incentive adjustments due to inspection failures. Upfront Incentive adjustments made as a result of inspection reports may only decrease the total incentive level; never increase. Contractor or TPO is responsible for the original Upfront Incentive calculation and will therefore be held responsible for any reduction in upfront incentive amount as a result of the inspection report or other submitted documentation. Reduction in upfront incentive as a result of Contractor or TPO mistake or negligence shall not be passed on to customers.  

The Program Administrators may decide to inspect a completed system based on the installer history, the Self Inspection Checklist, the customer availability, and if the Host Customer opted into an inspection. The Program Administrators will work to ensure that inspections are performed in a reasonable timeframe and do not impose an excessive burden or inconvenience on customers, or Contractors and TPOs in good standing. Customers may still decline the inspection if they are not available. The Program Administrators may modify its inspection policy to better accommodate Contractors or TPOs. Adjustments to the policy and/or processes will be detailed at the Energy Storage Solutions website.  

# 3.6. Project Completion Policy  

To ensure good stewardship of Energy Storage Solutions incentive funds, the Program Administrators will enforce a Project Completion policy. Approval of new incentive applications may be suspended and/or projects considered cancelled by the Program Administrators for projects that are non-compliant based on any of the eligibility requirements outlined above or any of the following rules:  

1. Project Expiration   
2. Inspection Failures and Delays   
3. Completion Deficiencies  

# 3.6.1. Project Expiration  

Incentive reservations may be cancelled for projects if their incentive approvals expire. Projects will be considered expired when a Contractor or TPO has projects that have passed the timeframe (as specified in Reservation of Funds letter) listed in incentive reservation letters or on the Energy Storage Solutions website, where applicable, whichever is later. Projects are Expired if all completion paperwork has not been submitted. Expired Projects may have their project status changed to “Cancelled”. Contractor or TPO may resubmit for approval at then-current incentive level unless the incentive level has increased and if project has not yet been installed. Incentive payments that were already received for cancelled projects must be returned to the Program Administrators within 30 days of cancellation.  

The Program Administrators reserve the right to modify schedule, deadlines, and timelines associated with Project Expiration and will post notice via the Enrollment Platform in the event of any changes.  

# 3.6.2. Inspection Failures and Delays  

Incentive reservations may be cancelled if projects fail to meet inspection deadlines:  

1. Failed Inspection of $^{90+}$ days – Any projects in “Failed Inspection” status for 90 days or more. Contractor or TPOs may be granted an exemption if they can demonstrate a delay outside Contractor or TPO control.   
2. Delayed Self-Inspection – Consistent failure to submit Self-Inspection documentation.   
3. Fail to report energy data to the Program Administrator’s Performance Data Monitoring platform  

# 3.6.3. Completion Deficiencies  

Projects will be rejected if responsible party fails to submit complete project completion information and paperwork, including but not limited to: inspection documentation, updated system specifications, certificates, change orders, signatures, audit trails and document revisions.  

# 3.7. Unsubscribing from Energy Storage Solutions  

Customers who enroll in Energy Storage Solutions will remain enrolled for 10 years from the date of Commercial Operation or until they provide written notice to the Program Administrators that they want to be removed from the Program. Once a season (summer or winter) starts, the customer must stay enrolled for the entire season to receive the performance incentive. A customer cannot unenroll midway through a season and receive the performance incentive for fewer events than all the other Program participants.  

Exiting from the Program before 10 years of system operation, or non-performance in Passive events during this period, will result in non-compliance with Program requirements and the customer will be required to return a prorated portion of the un-earned upfront incentive as determined by CGB.  

# 3.8. Extending Energy Storage Solutions Enrollment  

After 10 years of system operation, BESS may still have useful life. Customers wishing to continue participation in Active Dispatches (and associated performance incentives) may apply for an extension (subject to Program availability) and will be eligible to receive performance incentives at the rate at the time of re-enrollment.  

# 3.9. Transfer of Enrollment  

The Program Administrators will allow customers to transfer Program enrollment to other customers. If a customer moves out of their residence/facility leaving their BESS behind, the new occupant and BESS owner will be required to notify the EDCs of the change in ownership in order to ensure future performance payments will be processed to the new owner. The new owner will complete a BESS Ownership Transfer Form (See Appendix E) through the Enrollment Platform. Information required will include contact information (name, email, phone), address, and the new utility electric account number. For installations where the seller financed a portion of the BESS and a direct payment recipient was named during the application process, the seller will be responsible for notifying the direct payment recipient of the transfer or decision to unsubscribe from the program.  

If a customer moves out of their residence/facility leaving their BESS behind, and the new occupant does not participate in Energy Storage Solutions, then the original customer who entered into the Program Contract is responsible for returning a prorated portion of the upfront incentive upon property transfer.  

# 3.10. Electronic Signatures  

Contractors and TPOs may use and allow their retail customers to use electronic signatures in lieu of wet signatures for contracts and other documents in the Program and create such contracts and other documents in electronic form.  Electronic signatures must (a) use logically attached or associated with the electronic contract or other document being created and is verifiable, (b) include a date and time stamp of the electronic signature and an electronic audit trail of the electronic signature and the electronic contract or other document that is created, and (c) be sure the electronic contract or other document is created and retained in a secure electronic environment that preserves the integrity of the electronic contract and all the information contained therein and can be made available to the Program Administrators upon its request.  

Examples of electronic signature technology systems that are acceptable to the Program Administrators include DocuSign, HelloSign and Adobe Sign. Only commercially available thirdparty platforms are accepted. The Program Administrators will not accept electronic signatures that have been digitally altered, copied, or placed using computer software that does not provide a verifiable electronic audit trail.

11. Consistent failure to follow Program procedures.  

Contractor, TPO, or Aggregator may be given reasonable opportunity to correct problems identified by the Program Administrators, however, the Program Administrators reserve the right to immediately place on probation, suspend or terminate the Contractor, TPO, or Aggregator from the Program for any violation or alleged violation of Program rules at the Program Administrators’ sole discretion. Suspended Contractors, TPOs, or Aggregators may reapply to Energy Storage Solutions after their suspension period has ended. Suspended Contractors, TPOs, or Aggregators will submit a new Application, explain how prior violations were remedied if applicable, and include a plan for preventing future issues.  

# 4.3.7. Disciplinary Action and Appeal  

Upon the Program Administrators becoming aware of a violation, act, or omission, the Program Administrators may take one or more of the following actions:  

1. Contact principal(s) of Contractor, TPO, or Aggregator with written description of alleged Program violation(s) and request a written response to the allegations.   
2. Immediately suspend Contractor, TPO, or Aggregator  from Energy Storage Solutions and request a written response to the allegations. Suspension may remain in effect as an investigation is conducted.   
3. Forward all documentation relevant to Program violation allegations to the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) and/or Connecticut Attorney General’s office and/or PURA’s Office of Education, Outreach & Enforcement (EOE) and/or other relevant local, state or national agencies, officials, offices or organizations.  

The Program Administrators will review Contractor, TPO, or Aggregator response and request additional information as needed.  

The Program Administrators will respond in writing with their findings and with any disciplinary action. Such disciplinary action may include, but not be limited to:  

1. Probation (including but not limited to a limitation of incentive approvals)   
2. Suspension from Energy Storage Solutions  

# 3. Termination from Energy Storage Solutions indefinitely  

If Contractor, TPO, or Aggregator disagrees with the decision made by the Program Administrators, the Contractor, TPO, or Aggregator may appeal the decision within thirty (30) days of issuance to a review committee consisting of the officers of the CGB and representatives of Eversource and UI. The Contractor, TPO, or Aggregator shall have the right to present their appeal within forty-five (45) days from requesting such appeal. The decision of this review committee shall be the final determination on the matter.  

The Program Administrators may modify or expedite this process as the situation necessitates or as agreed to by the Contractor, TPO, or Aggregator and the Program Administrators. All involved parties are expected to work expeditiously in finding resolution, however, timelines shall not be guaranteed due to the unique nature of each situation.  

# 4.3.8. Important Implementation Notices for Project Completion Policy  

Contractors and TPOs with approval suspension will still be able to submit projects to the Program enrollment platform. However, projects submitted during an approval suspension period will be considered for approval at the incentive level in effect at the time the suspension is lifted (i.e., Contractors and TPOs under suspension will not be able to “reserve” prior incentive levels).  

These rules are applicable throughout the entire duration of the Program, and the Program Administrators may implement suspensions at any point in time based on non-compliance with these rules.  

Contractors and TPOs are ultimately responsible for project management including tracking the status of their projects with respect to this policy.  

The Program Administrators reserve the right to adjust these rules and will provide notice of changes. The Program Administrators reserve the right to make the final determination on a Contractor or TPO’s standing with respect to these rules, including decisions as to whether Contractor or TPO has achieved compliance and whether suspension may be lifted. The Program Administrators are not obligated to provide exceptions to this policy. The Program Administrators will consider a Contractor or TPO’s inability to comply with this Project Completion Policy a violation of Program rules.  

# 4.3.9.  List of Eligible Contractors, TPOs, and BESS Aggregators  

The Program Administrators will maintain a list of Eligible Contractors and TPOs. This list will be available on the Program website. Eligible BESS Aggregators will be listed alongside Eligible Equipment.  

# Section 5: Operational Control  

In the event of an emergency within the customer’s facility, the customer should call the appropriate emergency services. As quickly as is feasible, the customer should notify their respective EDCs’ customer care centers to report the emergency25.  

Eligible BESS in Energy Storage Solutions must be connected to and controlled by the relevant residential or C&I DERMS. The DERMS will send dispatch signals for both the Passive and Active programs. Dispatch events will include Passive and Active events as described in subsequent sections. The EDCs will require each system to include the following the minimum control and monitoring aspects, at minimum:  

1. Telemetry. Telemetry requirements will include a minimum granular location, charge, discharge, state of charge, and schedule of events. This telemetry should meet the Program requirements of at least15-minute interval data at a minimum of 1-month latency. In addition, the DERMS platform should receive this telemetry from every discrete BESS and not at a fleet level. Additional details are provided below in Section 5.1.   
2. Dispatching. The EDC will initiate the dispatch of the battery energy storage system through their DERMS platform, accounting for Program dispatch and any ISO-NE override instructions, and the EDC can schedule the dispatch in advance or in real-time.26 Event packages may include start/stop, charge/discharge, and level of charge/discharge. The BESS Operator or Aggregator will be responsible for “last-mile” operational instructions to the Customer System.   
3. Override. If required to maintain the safety and reliability of the grid, EDCs may also override or cancel dispatch events scheduled by the ISO-NE for battery energy storage systems participating in their programs and/or operations.  

The communication to the BESS may be a direct connection to the DERMS platform. However, other layered communications constructs are acceptable if the system meets the above minimum operational control requirements. This flexibility would allow a BESS Operator or Aggregator to control the “last-mile” communication to the BESS via a third-party system, if that system provided upwards telemetry, dispatching, and override capabilities to the respective DERMS. Notification will be provided to the customer’s BESS Operator or Aggregator via an approved API or OpenADR Protocol.  

BESS operation allows support of the grid with high-speed operations driven by the technology of the system components. While synced to the grid, the lithium-ion BESS has proven to respond with full load capability from remote telemetry in the 1-2 second time range. From an offline state, the BESS can sync to the grid and provide full power in less than 30 seconds in most circumstances. The steps required to go from offline to an online state has a relatively simple control sequence and using the Power Conditionings System (PCS) or inverter/transformer to sync to the electrical characteristics of the grid. Figure 1 illustrates a high-level depiction of the hardware required for both the EDC and ISO-NE to manage control of the BESS through the DERMS platform.  

![](images/d1d7ae0aacf3bc55098fe1afa5863ff271b9b74648931eaedb2b5d3c7c0d352a.jpg)  
Figure 1 BESS Network and Supervisory Controls and Data Acquisition Diagram  

# 5.1. Operations  

Networking and communication of the BESS with EDC supervisory controls will be critical to successful operation over the term of an agreement. Over time, integration with data acquisition (SCADA) systems will improve the performance and value of storage systems, BESS will be expected to incorporate SCADA communications as applicable.  

# 5.1.1. General Operating Standards  

The BESS Operator must provide the telemetry (i.e., data from the BESS) capable of communicating the minimum data elements as described below:  

Critical operating parameters that the Operator should monitor throughout the BESS include but are not limited to: inverter AC and DC voltage, current, kW, kVA, kVAR, power factor; battery rack voltage and current, battery module min/max voltage, auxiliary system critical parameters, fire detection/suppression monitoring points, state of charge, and temperature monitoring points of the battery racks.  

BESS Operator or Aggregator’s telemetry must ensure data can be provided to the DERMS at intervals not to exceed 15 minutes with a maximum latency of one month.  

Utility grade meters that were selected according to ANSI standards will need to be maintained throughout the lifetime. Inspection and testing of all meters will conform to Good Utility Practice, but not less often than every five (5) Contract Years at Customer, owner, or BESS Operator’s expense. Upon reasonable written request to the Customer, the EDC will request, at its own expense, inspection or testing of any such meters more frequently.  

# 5.1.2. Dispatching Passive and Active Services  

The BESS installed through the Program must be capable of meeting the following dispatch requirements, as required by appropriate Customer Class.  

# Passive Dispatch27  

• Notification: For BESS systems receiving upfront incentives, the DERMS will provide advance notification to the BESS Operator who will implement discharge information to the Customer’s BESS and comply with the following schedule:  

o Event Window and Frequency: Passive Dispatch will occur Monday through Friday in the months of June, July, and August, except for holidays.  Passive Dispatch hours will be between 5 PM EST and 8 PM EST.  

Discharge: Operator will ensure the battery discharges its available energy capacity at a constant rate in each hour during the 3-hour dispatch window, while maintaining a minimum reserve of $20\%$ of rated battery capacity.  

Participation Term: The Customer will participate in Passive Dispatch activities for the term of this agreement.  

# Active Dispatch  

• Notification: When ISO New England forecasts electric grid capacity constraints, the EDCs will provide notification to the BESS Operator via the DERMS at least 24 hours in advance of the start of the Active Dispatch event  

o Event Windows and Frequency: The EDCs may initiate between 30-60 requests for Active Dispatch from June through September and up to 5 requests from November through March.  The Active Dispatch event will be a maximum of 3 hours between the hours of 12 PM to 9 PM.  

• Discharge: BESS Operators will be provided with the requested discharge level for the event.  Actual performance will be verified based on data captured by the Customer’s Operator and reported back to the DERMS.  

Active Dispatch Performance: To receive performance incentives, customers must participate in Active Dispatch events.  If a customer does not participate in an event, they will receive 0 kW performance for that event. The Customer’s performance incentive is based on the average kW discharge from all events called during each dispatch season (i.e., summer or winter).  

# Override Conditions  

During the term of this Operating Agreement, the EDCs may require an override (i.e., cancel or change the timing of an event) of a scheduled dispatch event based on the following circumstances:  

• Overriding Passive Dispatch with Active Dispatch Events: If an Active Dispatch event is scheduled by the EDC during a day with Passive Dispatch already scheduled, the DERMS will send notification to the BESS Operator with start time, stop time, and duration of an Active event at least 24 hours in advance.  The planned Passive Dispatch for the scheduled day will be cancelled at that time. The customer will also receive email notification that the Passive Dispatch was cancelled at least 24 hours in advance of the planned Active Dispatch.   
• Other Override Conditions: EDCs may also override scheduled dispatch events (Passive or Active) for all Customer Classes for the following reasons:  

o Grid Safety and Reliability. Critical system events that impact system voltage levels, system stability and safety, or distribution system events that are considered emergencies by the EDCs may require override of a customer’s BESS.  While such conditions are rare, the EDCs will attempt to provide advance notification whenever possible, dependent on the nature of the event. Notification would be provided to the Operator via established communication protocol. Customers will also receive an email notification that the scheduled event is being cancelled.  

Forecasted Severe Weather Conditions. Known severe weather events that are anticipated to trigger the EDC’s Emergency Restoration Plan (ERP) level 1-5 activities may also generate conditions which require an override of scheduled events to ensure the customer’s backup capacity is available in case an outage is experienced by the customer. In such an event, EDCs will initiate cancellation notification to BESS Operators of all planned dispatch events (Passive and Active) 48 hours in advance whenever possible.  Notification will also be provided to customers whose scheduled events are being cancelled due to severe weather conditions. The cancellation will continue until restoration of incurred outages has been completed or the weather event has ended.  

# 5.2. Battery System Maintenance, Internet Connection, and Durability Responsibility  

Contractors and TPOs are responsible for maintaining the Customer’s BESS so that it can respond to dispatch events. Performance data is expected to come from the BESS, not a separate meter, as dictated by the ANSI standard mentioned in Section 4.2.1 Technical Requirements. The incentive amount could be affected if: (1) a BESS is not properly maintained, (2) the internet connection to the BESS is not maintained, or (3) any other aspect that would cause the BESS to discharge less or be unable to properly report performance. Electric storage capacities degrade over time, causing them to be able to discharge less power and/or energy. This will also affect the incentive amount. Therefore, prior to enrolling in Energy Storage Solutions, customers and their Contractor or TPO should consider the possibility of smaller than anticipated incentives due to lifecycle management decisions combined with expected performance decreases over the life of the BESS.  

# Section 6: Program Dispatch and Incentive Structure  

CGB will administer the Passive Dispatch declining-block upfront incentive and the EDCs will administer the Active Dispatch ongoing performance incentive. To be eligible for upfront incentives, projects must meet the requirements defined in Section 4 on customer and technology eligibility. Additionally, the BESS must be set to the Passive Dispatch default settings, or another acceptable use case determined by CGB and approved by the Authority, such as Active-Only Dispatch. Systems installed prior to January 1, 2022 are not eligible for the Upfront Incentive but may apply to participate in the Active Dispatch portion of the Program and earn the Performance Incentive provided their application is approved pursuant to Section 3.3.  

# Program Requirements  

The EDCs have developed the following Program requirements:  

• There must be an appropriate interconnection agreement that meets the relevant EDC’s standard interconnection requirements. Ability to meet both the Passive and Active Dispatch needs of the Program, as applicable, including completing software integration with dispatch platforms utilized in the Program, and the ability for technology to receive remote software upgrades. Approved electric storage technologies (See Appendix A) will require completing the New Technology Application (Appendix C) to obtain eligibility from the EDCs to engage in the integration process with the DERMS vendors. Costs associated with the integration effort will be borne by the BESS Operator or OEM.  

The Program will allow for BESS to be both standalone and coupled with other energy resources (e.g., solar), if such configurations are also in compliance with EDC interconnection agreements. Both alternating current (AC)-coupled and direct current (DC)-coupled battery systems are eligible for Energy Storage Solutions.  

# 6.1 Passive Dispatch and Upfront Incentives  

CGB, in consultation with the EDCs, is responsible for developing the guidelines governing Passive Dispatch.28 Customers that receive an upfront incentive (Residential Customers, Commercial – Fully Enrolled Customers, and Priority Customers, collectively “Passive Dispatch Participants”) must participate in the Passive Dispatch portion of the Program. 29  This requires setting the BESS to automatically store and dispatch energy through the BESS to reduce demand during summer peak periods (see Table 2). Typically, Passive Dispatch participants will not need to take any action for their BESS to respond to a Passive discharge event, as the BESS shall be pre-programmed to participate in Passive events according to the Program schedule. The residential BESS participating in Energy Storage Solutions will be required to have capability to export to the grid in order to maximize benefits to the grid.30 The conditions that allow for exemption will be detailed in separate Program materials as the factors affecting those conditions evolve.  

As part of the Application process, the Program Administrators will require all Passive Dispatch Participants to sign the Data Release and Terms & Conditions Agreement (see Appendix B) asserting compliance with the Passive Dispatch guidelines. Customers may deviate from Passive Dispatch parameters (without penalty) only under the following circumstances:  

· During emergency events as determined by the relevant EDC.   
• During Active Dispatch events as determined by the relevant EDC. During severe weather events as determined by the relevant EDC or by the BESS Operator, Aggregator, or OEM where there is a high likelihood of a grid outage  

Approved BESS Operators, Aggregators, or OEMs participating in passive dispatch must report all passive dispatch event hours during which their batteries were unable to perform due to an OEMtriggered severe storm event occurring within an uncanceled passive dispatch period. Such reports shall be submitted to the Program Administrators after the end of the Program’s passive dispatch season by October 15 of each year. As supporting evidence, Approved BESS Operators, Aggregators or OEMs must provide clear rationale and relevant data (e.g., National Weather Service alerts for the specific dates when the battery did not perform) to justify the cancellation of the passive dispatch hour.  

During Passive Dispatch events, Passive Dispatch Participants are required to discharge down to $20\%$ of the BESS rated capacity. The Passive Dispatch window is 3 hours in duration.  

For example: a fully-charged BESS with 15 kWh rated energy capacity will have a maximum of 12 kWh available for Passive Dispatch and 3 kWh for reserve. During Passive Dispatch, the BESS will discharge at an average rate of 4 kWh per hour for the 3-hour duration. This is illustrated in the chart below:  

![](images/9c24f9039ec3a5ae5cad493a8863bfa485dcb76085b96b113962ddf2432e0c0a.jpg)  
Figure 2: 15 kWh Battery Passive Dispatch  

# 6.1.1. Customer Classifications  

Residential Customers (including Priority customers) are eligible for upfront incentives, administered by CGB, as defined in Table 4. The residential upfront incentive structure follows a declining block structure with decreasing $\$1k W h$ incentive offerings as Program participation meets stepped capacity milestones.  

Multifamily Affordable Housing (MFAH) Customers that meet all qualifications are eligible for the Low-Income Residential incentive rate (See MFAH definition in Sec. 1 Glossary), which may also access the Grid-Edge adder, if applicable (See Table 6). The owner of a BESS at a MFAH housing site must ensure that the project’s resiliency benefits are equitably shared with tenants. To enforce tenant resiliency sharing, applications for MFAH projects must demonstrate that tenants will receive a fair and equitable portion of the energy stored by the BESS during a power outage31. Given the diversity of multifamily housing types across the state, the specific level of resiliency sharing will be determined at the discretion of the Program Administrators. Exceptions to resiliency benefit sharing may be granted in rare cases by the Program Administrators if compelling, datadriven evidence shows that a MFAH project would become financially unviable due to a direct tenant resiliency sharing requirement.

Commercial Customers (including Priority customers) are eligible for upfront incentives, administered by CGB as defined in Table 5. The designation between small, medium, and large is based on the customer’s annual peak demand. Customers installing an oversized battery system with a power rating greater than their annual peak demand will receive a prorated upfront incentive according to the Tiers described in Table 5. An incentive calculator is available at www.energystoragect.com/contractor-resources.  

Assigning the applicable Small, Medium, and Large Upfront Incentive will be determined based on a customer’s “annual peak demand”, defined as the highest peak demand billed for the twelve (12) months prior to application, as determined by the customer’s utility for billing purposes. In the event this calculation is not possible (e.g. no interval data available), Program Administrators may use the billing demand in a customer’s utility bill.

# 6.1.2. Passive Dispatch Season Performance and Claw Back  

Passive Dispatch Participants will be required to participate in Passive Dispatch events for ten (10) full years beginning on the date their system is connected to its respective DERMS. Customers who enroll midway through a Passive Dispatch season will not be penalized for partial participation. Rather, they will participate in the remainder of the season for Year 1, and in the beginning of the season for Year 11, totaling 10 full seasons of participation. Exiting from Energy Storage Solutions before the end of this period, or non-performance in Passive events during this period, will result in non-compliance with Program requirements and the system owner will be required to return a prorated portion of the un-earned incentive.  

The claw back evaluation process will commence at the end of each summer season. The evaluation will determine whether a participating BESS responded to greater than $90\%$ of the Passive Dispatch hours at the enrolled level.32  

The following formula will be used to determine each Customer’s Passive Dispatch Season Performance:  

# Passive Dispatch Season Performance

$C=$ All Passive dispatch hours canceled by the Program Administrators that were not replaced by an Active dispatch event   
$D=$ All Passive dispatch event hours called, and all Active dispatch event hours called to replace a Passive dispatch event in which a battery could not perform because it was responding to an OEM-Triggered Severe Storm event, provided the Dispatch hour was not also canceled by the Program Administrators   
$E=$ Total potential Passive dispatch hours forthe season  

Passive Dispatch Season Performance values less than $90\%$ will trigger a claw back.  When the claw back is triggered, the system owner will be responsible for a Violation $\mathsf{F e e}^{35}$ as follows:  

$$
\left(1-\left(\frac{P a s s i v e D i s p a t c h S e a s o n P e r f o r m a n c e}{0.9}\right)\right)*(U p f r o n t I n c e n t i v e*0.1)
$$  

In the event that the system owner does not pay Violation Fees as described above, performance incentive payouts will be swept by CGB until the cost of the Violation Fee is recovered. If no performance incentive payouts are available to be swept, the system owner will be billed by CGB.  

If the system owner is able to demonstrate a valid reason for non-compliance (e.g. equipment or software failure beyond the system owner’s control), they may appeal the Violation Fees to CGB directly. The Program Administrators are prohibited from unilaterally waiving any upfront incentive clawback fees. All clawback fee waivers will now require review and approval from the Authority. To facilitate this process, the Program Administrators must submit all recommended clawback fee waivers to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority for approval annually by November 1.  

Detailed examples of Passive Dispatch Season Performance and Violation Fees are provided at www.energystorageCT.com/contractor-resources.  

Passive Dispatch Participants will also be automatically enrolled in Active Dispatch.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Upfront Incentive Adder</td><td>Customer Category</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5">+25%:Non-Residential</td><td>SmallBusiness</td></tr><tr><td>CriticalFacilities</td></tr><tr><td>Customers Replacing Fossil Fuel Generators</td></tr><tr><td>Grid Edge</td></tr><tr><td>Grid Edge</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# 6.1.3.1 Customers on the Grid Edge  

Customers on the Grid Edge are defined as (1) the top ten percent of circuits with the highest number of outages per customer during major storms since July 1, 2012, and (2) the top ten percent of circuits with the longest outages due to major storms since July 1, 2012. A map of circuits that meet grid edge criteria can be found in the Program’s website.  

# 6.1.3.2 Critical Facilities  

As of January 1, 2024 Critical Facilities shall be defined by the revised definition according to Gen. Stat. $\S$ 16-243y(a)(2)37. EDCs will confirm applicant’s qualification as a critical facility as part of the application process.  

# 6.1.3.3      Commercial and Industrial Customers Replacing Fossil Fuel Generators  

This category applies to C&I customers who are replacing an existing fossil fuel generators with an energy storage system of comparable size. Customers must demonstrate their plan to decommission the fossil fuel generator(s) with a Decommissioning Plan. A template Decommissioning Plan is included in Appendix H. Decommissioning Plans are subject to review and approval by Program Administrators in order to qualify for the Upfront Incentive adder. Customers must fully decommission the existing fossil fuel generator and may not sell or otherwise redeploy the fossil fuel generator. The Program Administrators reserve the right to audit and inspect the customer’s site to ensure the generator has been decommissioned.  

# 6.1.3.4 Small Business Customers  

Small business customers are commercial and industrial customers with less than 200 kW annual peak demand.  

# 6.1.4. Calculation of Upfront Incentive  

The calculation of the upfront incentive is primarily based on the nameplate energy capacity (kWh) of the BESS, with some limiting factors. The upfront residential incentive is calculated based on the minimum of the following three formulas:  

• Residential Formula 1: BESS rated energy capacity $(\mathrm{kWh})^{\star}[\$250/\mathrm{kWh}]^{\mathrm{38}}$ • Residential Formula 2: $50\%$ of BESS total installed cost Residential Formula 3: Maximum per-residential unit incentive of $\$16,000$  

The upfront C&I incentive is calculated based on the minimum of the following two formulas:  

• C&I Formula 1: BESS rated energy capacity (kWh) \* [Rate applicable to demand tier]40. • C&I Formula 2: $50\%$ of BESS total installed cost  

C&I systems are limited in power $({\sf k W})$ eligible to receive an upfront incentive to $150\%$ of the customer’s annual peak demand or 2 MW, whichever is greater. The following illustrative examples demonstrate how incentive calculations work. For additional examples and a calculator tool, along with the latest incentive rates and schedule, please visit the Energy Storage Solutions website.  

Example 1 - In the case of one 5 kW, 13.5 kWh battery with an installed cost of $\$20,000$ , for a standard Residential Customer:  

13.5 kWh \* $\$250/\mathrm{kWh}$ , or $\$3,375$ • $50\%$ of $\$20,000$ , or $\$10,000$ Maximum incentive of $\$16,000$  

The customer would receive an upfront incentive of $\$3,375$ .  

Example 2 – In the case of two batteries that add up to 15.2 kW, 36 kWh with an installed cost of $\$30,000$ , for a grid-edge Residential Customer:  

36 kWh $\star\$250/k W h$ , or $\$9,000$ adder $\mathbf{\Phi}=\$13,500$   
$50\%$ of $\$30,000$ , or $\$15,000$   
Maximum incentive of $\$16,000$  

The customer would receive an upfront incentive of $\$12,500$ .  

Example 3 – In the case of two batteries that add up to 10 kW, 27 kWh with an installed cost of $\$30,000$ , for a low-income Residential Customer:  

27 kWh $\star\$600/k W h$ , or $\$16,200$ $50\%$ of $\$30,000$ , or $\$15,000$ Maximum incentive of $\$16,000$  

The customer would receive an upfront incentive of $\$15,000$ .  

Example 4 – In the case of one 250 kW, 675 kWh battery for a medium-sized Commercial customer with an annual peak demand of $240~\mathsf{k W}$ and an installed cost of $\$378,000$ (Tranche 3 Step 1)  

$675k W h\times\$159.25/k W h$ , or $\$107$ ,494 $50\%$ of $\$378,000$ , or $\$189,000$  

The customer would receive an upfront incentive of $\$107,494$ .  

Example 5 – In the case of one 3 MW, 10 MWh battery for a large-sized Commercial grid-edge customer with an annual peak demand of 2 MW and an installed cost of $\$2,500,000$ (Tranche 3 Step 1)  

? $10{,}000\mathsf{k W h}\star\Phi91/\mathsf{k W h}$ , or $\$910,000$ grid-edge adder $=\$1$ ,137,500 $50\%$ of $\$2,500,000$ , or $\$1$ ,250,000  

The customer would receive an upfront incentive of $\$1$ ,137,500  

Example 6 – In the case of one 1.4 MW, 5 MWh battery for a small-sized Commercial small business customer with an annual peak demand of $180k W$ and an installed cost of $\$1$ ,950,000 (Tranche 3 Step 1)  

• System is $>150\%$ of customer’s peak demand, but $<2$ MW. Incentive cap not exceeded. • Tiered incentive calculation $41+25\%$ small business adder $=\$741$ ,406 • $50\%$ of $\$1,950,000$ , or $\$975,000$  

The customer would receive an upfront incentive of $\$741$ ,406  

Example 7 – In the case of one 3 MW, 15 MWh battery for a large-sized Commercial customer with an annual peak demand of $750\mathsf{k W}$ and an installed cost of $\$3,500,000$ (Tranche 3 Step 1)  

• System is not capable of dispatching $80\%$ of its capacity in a 3-hour passive dispatch window • System is $:>150\%$ of customer’s peak demand and $>2$ MW, exceeding incentive cap • $150\%$ of peak demand $=1.125$ MW. Capped system size is 2 MW  

The project must be redesigned and resubmitted.  

# 6.1.5. Hybrid Upfront Incentive  

Hybrid projects are defined as those where a single BESS will be interconnected to a single utility account where the building is used for both multifamily affordable housing (MFAH) and other nonresidential activities. The method used to calculate Hybrid project Upfront Incentives is as follows:  

1. PAs will review all available consumption and demand data to determine a proportion of the consumption and/or demand to be applied to each use case (ex: $40\%$ MFAH, $60\%$ C&I).   
2. The C&I incentive portion will be calculated based on the proportion of the demand and/or consumption attributable to the commercial operations (ex: if $60\%$ C&I, then the kW / kWh  

ratings of the BESS and the customer’s annual peak demand will be multiplied by $60\%$ and entered into the then-current C&I incentive calculator).  

3. The Residential portion will be calculated based on the remaining proportion of the BESS at the then-current incentive level for MFAH (ex: in the above case, $40\%$ of the BESS kW and kWh entered into the low-income residential incentive calculator). The Residential portion cannot exceed $\$16,000$ per residential unit.  

4. The C&I and Residential incentive portions will be totaled for a final approved Upfront Incentive amount but cannot exceed $50\%$ of the total project cost.  

# 6.2 Active Dispatch and Performance Incentives  

Active Dispatch Participants will be enrolled and eligible to participate in Active events for ten (10) full years beginning on the date their system is connected to its respective DERMS. Customers can enroll at any time. A customer who enrolls part way through a season may participate in the remainder of the season for Year 1, and in the beginning of the season for Year 11, totaling 10 full seasons of participation. Exiting from Energy Storage Solutions Active Dispatch before the end of this period or declining events will not yield any violation. When an Active Dispatch event is called, the Passive Dispatch event for that day is cancelled. In the situation that an Active Dispatch event is called by the EDCs during the Passive Dispatch hours, the Active Dispatch shall take precedence over the Passive Dispatch event.  

Table 7: Summer and Winter Active Dispatch Parameters

The incentive rate tied to performance during Active Dispatch events for each option is shown in Table 8.  

Table 8: Active Dispatch Performance Incentive for Cycle One (2022 – 2024)

Participating customers are eligible to receive performance incentives for the same BESS for up to 10 years. These 10 years of eligible performance incentives are split into an opening period (years 1 – 5) and a closing period (years 6 – 10). Customers may also be granted a construction hold commencing on the Reservation of Funds (ROF) date (if extensions are granted per Sec. 3.1.4). The construction hold will temporarily lock in the performance incentive rates at that cycle while the  

BESS is built. The extension hold requires certain milestones are met as described in Section 3: Enrollment. Systems built under the granted timeframe (if granted an extension per Sec. 3.1.4) may be immediately eligible to start their opening period. Systems that require longer than the granted timeframe of construction or those that do not meet the required milestones within the hold must reapply to Energy Storage Solutions and will be reviewed under the cycle rates current to that time.  

If a system’s opening period commenced mid-season, that system will receive $0\mathsf{k W}$ as performance for any events missed but will be allowed to earn performance on any remaining events of that season.

# 6.3 Active Dispatch Incentive Rates and Average Performance  

Performance is measured as the average discharge capacity from the BESS across all Active events during the given season. If the BESS is dispatched with less than 24 hours notice, the event will not be counted in the calculation of the seasonal performance incentive however, BESS that participate in such events will be compensated for their performance at the applicable rates. If a customer opts out of an event or has some communication or other issue that prevents them from discharging during an event, they will be given a 0 kW performance for that event. These will affect the customer’s average performance and incentive.  

The performance incentive rates refer to the average dispatch amount across all events of the dispatch season. Eligible BESS Aggregators, Operators, or OEMs must provide twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week service with 15-minute intervals (or more granular data) for the entire demand response season in order to receive fees or for their customers to receive performance incentives. Lapses in service that result in missing data during an event will result in performance being measured at 0 kW-AC for the duration of the missing data. Performance per event is equal to the average discharge rate of the BESS in kW-AC over the length of the event as described below.  

Customers cannot increase their performance for an event by curtailing solar photovoltaic production to increase the BESS discharge rate. For example, if the inverter size limits the total production of the solar photovoltaic system and BESS, then the Customer cannot limit the solar photovoltaic system during a dispatch event so that the battery can discharge more. As a result, the Program Administrators will require that the BESS provides discharge performance value disaggregated from coincident solar production. Solar inverters and controllers must operate in maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode at all times and this parameter must be reporting to the DERMS platform through the Supplier SCADA system.  

Active Dispatch does not require the customer to hold any reserve capacity. Events will dispatch assuming all capacity is available, to the OEM minimum required reserve capacity. Therefore, customers may dispatch their full available capacity during Active Events to maximize performance incentives. This would yield an average dispatch of 1/3 of the usable energy capacity per hour during a 3-hour event for a fully charged battery.  

Using the previous example of a 15 kWh system, a customer with a fully charged system would be able to participate at up to 5 kWh per hour over a 3-hour Active Dispatch event, for an average of 5 kW for that event, provided there is no OEM minimum required reserve capacity set for the system.  

Continuing with this example, a typical summer season may have 40 Active Dispatch events called. This customer did not participate in 5 events. This could be due to many reasons such as the BESS not being installed until mid-season, customer opt-outs, or the Operator was unable to provide data. In all cases of non-participation, the customer is given 0 kW across those event hours. However, for the remaining event hours the customer participated at an average hourly output of $5\mathsf{k W}$ . The average of 5 3-hour events at $0\mathsf{k W}$ and 35 3-hour events at $5\mathsf{k W}$ is an average summer seasonal performance of $4.375~\mathsf{k W}$ . The summer performance incentive will be calculated as $\$200/k W$ $4.375~\mathsf{k W}=\$875$ .  

The average season performance for winter events will be a separate additive incentive calculation using the same process, based on the winter performance rate. If the customer in the example participates, as expected, at $5\mathsf{k W}$ for all winter event the incentive would be calculated as: $\$25/\mathsf{k W}$ $\textsf{X}5\textsf{k W}=\$125$ . Over the course of both seasons this customer was able to earn $\$875+$ $\$1,000$ in Active Dispatch performance incentives for the year.  

The calculation of incentive benefit specified here is subject to change by the Program Administrators (with PURA’s approval) and will be indicated on the Program website, customer enrollment forms and other Program materials.  

# 6.4 Incentive Payment Process  

CGB will administer all upfront incentive payments following the approval of the Application, an inspection (if opted-in) or self-inspection of the system’s installation at the discretion of the Program Administrators, and the provision of proof of enrollment in both Active and Passive Dispatch portions of Energy Storage Solutions. The relevant EDC will administer the incentive payments for summer and winter performance, as calculated in the “Incentive Rates and Average Performance” section and will be paid by the EDC approximately 6-8 weeks following the Summer and Winter seasons. Once enrolled in Energy Storage Solutions, the EDC will add the customer’s BESS to their DERMS system.  

# 6.4.1 Upfront Incentive Payments  

Upfront incentives are provided as upfront discounts or reflected in the customer’s purchase or lease agreement with their Contractor or TPO. CGB will disburse upfront incentive reimbursements to eligible Contractors, TPOs, or participating BESS owners as indicated on the  

Application. If payments to entities besides the Customer account holder (i.e., TPO) are requested the Customer and other entity must both sign and acknowledge this on the Application.  

After incentive approval and once the system is installed and energized, Contractors and TPOs shall submit proof of project completion and interconnection through the online enrollment platform. Once verified by CGB that installation was performed in accordance with the original or amended incentive application, all completion documentation has been submitted and approved, Passive Dispatch enrollment has been verified, and all applicable Program requirements have been met, the project will be eligible to have the upfront incentive reimbursed to the Contractor or TPO. CGB will process incentive reimbursement payments to Contractors and TPOs in monthly batches.  

If a battery system is not installed properly or in accordance with the proposed system specifications submitted to the Program Administrators, CGB reserves the right to withhold or recalculate upfront incentive payments based on actual installed equipment and site conditions. Additionally, the Program Administrators may stop approving incentive applications and/or withhold payments for Contractors and TPOs that consistently have problems properly installing BESS and/or complying with the requirements of Energy Storage Solutions.  

Additional information regarding the upfront incentive payment will be made available by the Program Administrators in a separate document on the Energy Storage Solutions website.  

# 6.4.2 Performance Incentive Data and Payments  

Performance incentives will be calculated in accordance with Section 6.3. and paid by the EDCs following the Summer and Winter seasons.  

To enhance data transparency and support Program enrollment, the Program Administrators must provide all available Active and Passive Dispatch performance data to ESS customers upon request, within 90 days after the end of a dispatch season after a data request is made.  

# 6.4.3 Direct Payments  

Battery storage owners will have access to direct payment options, which will support PURA’s key Program objectives, including facilitating deployment of battery storage in LMI and vulnerable communities, while at the same time reducing risk to homeowners and capital providers and lowering system financing costs.  

Customers can designate a direct payment payee at the time of enrollment, and EDCs will assign upfront and/or performance incentive payments in part of in full to a TPO or financial institution, as specified by the Customer.  

# 6.5 Days for Demand Response Events (Active and Passive)  

Active discharge events are called on weekends, weekdays, or holidays – for both summer and winter.  

Passive discharge events are limited to non-holiday weekdays during the Summer season (June, July and August) only. Holidays excluded from Passive Dispatch events include:  

Table 10: Holidays for Passive Dispatch Events   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Dispatch Season</td><td>Holiday</td><td>Typical Date</td></tr><tr><td>Summer</td><td>Independence Day</td><td>July 4</td></tr><tr><td>Summer</td><td>Juneteenth</td><td>June19</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# 6.6 No Demand Response Events Before Large Storms  

Customers often purchase energy storage systems in part for backup power during power outages. Under non-storm operating scenarios, no more than 80 percent of available energy capacity will be used during Passive events, leaving 20 percent available for backup power. The EDCs will cancel events (Active or Passive) for the two (2) days preceding any predicted Emergency Restoration Plan level (level 1-5) outage events, leaving the customer to use the BESS as the customer deems appropriate.  

# 6.7 Performance Testing  

The Program Administrators may conduct performance tests of the BESS during installation or during periodic inspections (if opted-in). However, the Program Administrators may periodically elect to run communication tests to ensure all notification processes are functioning. A BESS Commissioning & Acceptance Testing program that will ensure that system perform as designed and that the system meets the Technical Requirements and performs as expected. Commissioning documentation typically includes but is not limited to:  

Electrical Design verification ? Certificates of Code Compliance Power/Energy Capability testing Modes of Operation testing in Local/Remote Control Functional acceptance testing of fire detection and suppression Network Integration and SCADA point verification First Responder orientation record  

BESS OEMs, Operators, and Aggregators may work with CGB, the EDCs, and the Program’s DERMS providers, if necessary, to call up to two Passive Dispatch test events per year. Participation in these test events shall be optional and not affect the Upfront Incentive Claw Back provisions detailed in Section 6.1.2.  

# Section 7: Storage Configuration Considerations  

7.6 Storage Configurations & Interconnection  

# 7.6.1 Renewable Energy Plus Storage  

Customers with interconnected renewable energy systems, such as solar photovoltaics and wind turbines, may participate in Energy Storage Solutions. The investment tax credit (ITC), also known as the federal solar tax credit, may provide added incentives for energy storage systems charged by renewable energy systems. The battery system’s performance will be limited by the terms and conditions established in the approved interconnection agreement.  

# 7.6.2 Storage Only Systems  

Customers who do not have a renewable energy system but do have an energy storage system that charges from the grid may participate in Energy Storage Solutions. If the customer will be discharging electricity to the grid, they must go through the normal interconnection process with their relevant EDC. The battery system’s performance will be limited by the terms and conditions established in the approved interconnection agreement.

# COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL (C&I) CUSTOMER DECOMMISSIONING PLAN  

Version 1/1/2025  

A Decommissioning Plan is required for all C&I customers who are seeking priority status and the Upfront incentive adder for replacing an existing fossil fuel generator with an energy storage. To qualify, the existing fossil fuel generator and proposed battery energy storage system must be of comparable size, and customers must demonstrate their plan to decommission the fossil fuel generator(s).  

The Decommissioning Plan must be submitted at the time of Upfront Incentive Application in order to receive a Reservation of Funds that includes a Priority Customer adder for replacing a fossil fuel generator.  

Decommissioning Plans are subject to review and approval by Program Administrators. Customers must fully decommission the existing fossil fuel generator and may not sell or otherwise redeploy the fossil fuel generator. The Program Administrators reserve the right to audit and inspect the customer’s site to ensure the generator has been decommissioned.
