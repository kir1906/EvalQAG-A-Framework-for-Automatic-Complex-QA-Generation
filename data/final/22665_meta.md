 ## Summary : 
 **_Note:[The Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf#page=993)
created the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/) with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

The South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) is the lead agency for
South Carolina's NEVI plan. It submitted South Carolina's initial [NEVI
Plan](https://www.scdot.org/business/pdf/FINAL_SC%20NEVI%20Plan_08012022.pdf)
to the federal Joint Office of Energy and Transportation on August 1, 2022,
and its [2023
Update](https://www.scdot.org/business/pdf/FINAL_SC%20NEVI%20Plan_08012023.pdf)
was submitted on August 1, 2023.

SCDOT's preliminary analysis anticipates that the state will need 16 charging
stations to achieve NEVI compliance. SCDOT will initially prioritize
development in the rural sections of the state's interstate network. SCDOT had
a kickoff webinar in April 2024. As of June 2024, SCDOT is still developing
their procurement process, but anticipates the process beginning in late 2024.
