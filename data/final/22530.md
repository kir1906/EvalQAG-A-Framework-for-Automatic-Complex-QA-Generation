On January 4, 2016, the federal government filed a complaint against Volkswagen alleging violations of the Clean Air Act. The complaint alleged that approximately 580,000 model year 2009 to 2016 diesel vehicles manufactured by Volkswagen Group of America Inc., Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Audi AG, Porsche AG and Porsche Cars North America contained “defeat devices” in the form of computer software designed to cheat on federal emissions tests. This enabled the vehicles to emit levels of oxides of nitrogen $({\mathsf{N O x}})$ as high as 40 times the federal standard without detection by the vehicle’s On Board Diagnostic system, a system that numerous states, including New Hampshire, rely upon to detect and require repairs on vehicles exceeding federal emission standards.  

On October 2, 2017, the Department of Justice and Volkswagen signed a $\$15$ billion settlement, a portion of which – $\$2.9$ billion – is being held in an Environmental Mitigation Trust to be shared among Beneficiary U.S. states and tribes, based on the number of violating vehicles registered in each. New Hampshire was allocated a Trust share of $\$30,914,841$ . The purpose of the Mitigation Trust is to fund environmental mitigation projects to reduce emissions of $\mathsf{N O x}$ where the subject vehicles were, are or will be operated.  

In 2017, Governor Sununu directed the former Office of Strategic Initiatives (OSl to be New Hampshire's Lead Agency in relation to the Environmental Mitigation Trust funds. OSI worked closely with New Hampshire Department Environmental Services (NHDES) to develop New Hampshire’s Beneficiary Mitigation Plan that lays out how New Hampshire plans to spend the portion of the Trust allocated to the State. NHDES was subsequently appointed as Lead Agency by the Governor in August 2021.
