EV from a local or off-island dealership a $5,000 rebate. Applicants may also
receive a $500 rebate for eligible e-bikes purchased from qualified vendors.

One EV rebate and one e-bike rebate are allowed per household, as well as two
EV rebate applications per business entity (including non-profits).

EVs and e-bikes purchased starting April 1, 2023, are eligible and rebates are
given on a first-come, first-served basis.
