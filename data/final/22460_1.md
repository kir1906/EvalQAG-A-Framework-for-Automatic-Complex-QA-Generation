PART Puc 901  PURPOSE  

Puc 901.01  Purpose.  The purpose of Puc 900, pursuant to the mandate of RSA 362-A:9, is to establish reasonable interconnection requirements for safety, reliability, and power quality for net energy metering as the public interest requires, and consistent with the legislative declaration of purpose set forth in RSA 362-A:1, in which the legislature found:  

(a)  “It to be in the public interest to provide for small scale and diversified sources of supplemental electrical power to lessen the state's dependence upon other sources which may, from time to time, be uncertain;” (b)  “It to be in the public interest to encourage and support diversified electrical production that uses indigenous and renewable fuels and has beneficial impacts on the environment and public health;” and (c)  “That net energy metering for eligible customer-generators may be one way to provide a reasonable opportunity for small customers to choose interconnected self-generation, encourage private investment in renewable energy resources, stimulate in-state commercialization of innovative and beneficial new technology, enhance the future diversification of the state's energy resource mix, and reduce interconnection and administrative costs.”  

Puc 901.02  Applicability.  

(a)  Puc 904 through Puc 908 shall be applicable only to small net-metering customers.   
(b)  Puc 903.02(l) through (p) shall only apply to net surplus electricity exported to the distribution system that accumulates during the 12 monthly billing cycles preceding the March 2012 billing cycle and in subsequent billing cycles.   
(c)  Where expressly noted, the provisions of $\mathrm{Puc900}$ shall apply only to customer-generators subject to the standard net metering tariff or only to customer-generators subject to the alternative net metering tariff.   
(d)  Interconnection of large net-metering customer-generators shall be governed by each utility’s interconnection practices as set forth in its tariff filed with the commission.   
(e)  With the exception of Puc 903.02(u) and Puc 905.07, and unless otherwise noted, Puc 900 shall be applicable to rural electric cooperatives for which a certificate of deregulation is on file with the commission with respect to customer-generator subject to the standard net metering tariff up to the applicable cap set forth in Puc 903.02(b).

(1)  On or before May 15 of each year, the commission shall publish on its website its calculation of the rates for avoided costs of energy and capacity for the previous year ending March 31, to be used by utilities to calculate the economic value of surplus net-metered generation for the previous year, which may be paid or credited to customer-generators subject to the standard net metering tariff, starting in the June billing cycle, along with supporting calculations, an explanation of assumptions and data sources, and estimated portions of annual surplus generated during the hour or hours used to calculate avoided capacity costs pursuant to (6) and (7) below, capacity factors, if actual hourly surplus generation data is not used for such calculation pursuant to (5) below;  

(2)  The rates for avoided energy costs shall be based on the short-term avoided energy costs for the New Hampshire load zone in the wholesale electricity market administered by ISO New England, Inc., consisting of the hourly real time locational marginal price (LMP) of electricity plus generation-related ancillary service charges, all adjusted for the average line loss in New Hampshire between the wholesale metering point and the retail metering point;  

(3)  The rate for the avoided generation related capacity costs shall be based on the applicable ISO New England, Inc. Forward Capacity Market (FCM) price for the power year most closely matching the 12 months ending in the March billing cycle.  The avoided FCM price shall be adjusted to account for any peak energy rent payments made from the energy market that reduce direct capacity costs charged to load and for average line loss in New Hampshire between the wholesale metering point and the retail metering point.  Such adjusted price shall be used to determine the rate for avoided capacity costs in dollars per kilowatt to be used by utilities to calculate the value of generation capacity associated with surplus generation on a customer-bycustomer basis. If there is more than one hour in each power year on which ISO New England, Inc. allocates FCM costs to load, the commission shall structure the rate proportionally to ISO New England, Inc.’s allocation of such costs;  

(4)  In determining the customer-specific value of avoided capacity costs, each utility shall multiply the quantity (in kilowatts) of each customer-generator’s surplus generation exported to the distribution system at the hour or hours of capacity peak with respect to which FCM costs are allocated to load, whether actual, pursuant to (5) below, or estimated, pursuant to (6) or (7) below, as applicable, by the rate or rates determined by the commission pursuant to (1) and (3) above;  

(5)  If hourly meter data is available for a customer-generator’s net meter and the utility has the technical capability to utilize that data for avoided cost calculations, the utility, at its election by written notice to the commission on or before June 1 of each year, shall calculate the value of avoided capacity costs or avoided energy costs, or both, for each such customer-generator using actual hourly surplus generation data. The value of avoided energy costs shall be individually calculated by weighting the actual avoided energy costs for each hour of the 12 months ending the immediately preceding March 31, as determined by the commission pursuant to (1) and (2) above, by the actual hourly surplus electricity exported to the distribution system in each hour for the same period to determine a customer-specific average rate for the energy value of net surplus generation;  

(6)  For all types of net-metered systems other than solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, and for which actual hourly data is not utilized pursuant to (5) above:  

a.  The rate for avoided energy costs shall be calculated by using a simple average of hourly cost data from ISO New England, Inc. for the 12 months ending the immediately preceding March 31, assuming that surplus generation is, on average, equally distributed over all hours of the year; and   
b.  The portion of surplus generation estimated to be produced during the hour or hours of capacity peak on which FCM costs are allocated to load shall be equal to the number of such hours divided by 8,760;  

(7)  For net-metered PV systems for which actual hourly data is not utilized pursuant to (5) above, the rate for avoided energy costs shall be calculated as a weighted average annual rate by weighting the actual avoided costs for each hour of the 12 months ending the immediately preceding March 31 by the hourly generation output profile for PV systems in New Hampshire determined as follows:  

a.  If verifiable hourly generation output data is available and on file at the commission by April 5 for the applicable year from at least 25 kilowatts of PV system capacity operating within New Hampshire, then the output profile for PV systems shall be the hourly average of all such data; or  

b.  If such data is not available, the hourly generation output profile shall be the modeled hourly PV performance data output produced by the U.S. Department of Energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, PVWatts software, version 6.1.2, (available at https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/ ) with the default settings for Concord, New Hampshire; and  

c.  The portion of surplus generation estimated to be produced during the hour or hours of capacity peak on which FCM costs are allocated to load shall be in the same proportion as the output profile utilized pursuant to (7) a. or b. above.  

(p)  To correct an error in its determination of avoided costs, the commission shall, on its own motion, the motion of a utility, or the motion of a third party, revise its determination of rates for avoided costs and capacity factors as necessary. Any amounts paid or credited at the originally published rates and capacity factors shall be subject to reconciliation by the revised rates and factors.  

(q)  Annually, by written notice to the commission on or before June 1 of each year, each electric distribution utility may elect, by filing notice with the commission, to purchase or value surplus generation from customer-generators subject to the standard net metering tariff for the preceding year ending in the March billing cycle at a rate that is equal to the energy supply component of the applicable default service rate, instead of the avoided cost rates determined by the commission pursuant to paragraph (n) above, provided that payment is issued to such customer-generators at least as often as whenever the value of such credit, in excess of amounts owned by the customer-generator, is greater than $\$50$ .  

(r)  Upon termination of net energy metering, there shall be no payment or credit to a customer-generato subject to the standard net metering tariff for any remaining excess generation.  

(s)  For customer-generators subject to the alternative net metering tariff, upon termination of net energy metering the utility shall pay to such customer-generators an amount equal to the accumulated balance of any monetary bill credits.  

(t)  The commission shall waive any provision of $\mathrm{Puc900}$ or RSA 362-A, by order after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, if it determines that waiver of the applicable statute or rule section is a targeted net energy metering arrangement that is part of a utility strategy to minimize distribution costs, pursuant to RSA 362-A:9.  

(u)  The commission shall consider any request for a waiver, whether filed pursuant to (s) above or otherwise, pursuant to Puc 201.05.  

(v)  A distribution utility may perform an annual calculation to determine the net effect of net metering on its default service and distribution revenues and expenses in the prior calendar year.  Pursuant to Puc 203, the commission shall determine by order, after notice and hearing, the utility-specific method of performing the calculation and applying the results, as well as a reconciliation mechanism to collect or credit any such net effects with appropriate carrying charges and credits applied.  

(w)  Pursuant to Puc 203, upon petition by a utility or on its own motion, the commission shall, by order, after notice and hearing, establish on a utility-specific basis a methodology by which customer-generators shall be provided service under time-based net energy metering tariffs, provided that it determines the resulting rates are just and reasonable and in accordance with RSA 362-A:9, VIII.  

$\mathbf{\rho}(\mathbf{x})$ Renewable energy certificates associated with the customer-generator’s facility shall remain the property of the customer-generator until such certificates are sold or transferred.  

(y)  The following grandfathering provisions shall apply to customer-generators subject to either the standard net metering tariff or the alternative net metering tariff:  

(1)  Subsequent sales or other transfers of ownership of a net-metered facility or the property upon which the facility is located shall not affect the terms and conditions under which the customergenerator is rendered net metering service.  New owners may continue to take service under the same terms and conditions in effect at the time of such sale or transfer  and grandfathered pursuant to RSA 362-A:9, XV, RSA 362-A:9, XVI, and commission order 26,029.  Following that date, the new owners shall transition to tariffs that are in effect at the time, provided that the facility is not moved to a different location by the purchaser, transferee, or otherwise;  

(2)  Residential small customer-generators may expand the capacity of their facilities without limitation, provided that the expansion does not result in total facility capacity in excess of 100 kilowatts, and remain subject to the same applicable net metering tariff;  

(3)  A non-residential small customer-generator may expand the capacity of its facility by an amount up to the greater of either 20 kilowatts or 50 percent of the system capacity allocated into the standard net metering tariff program prior to September 1, 2017, or 50 percent of the original capacity of a facility installed under the alternative net metering tariff, as applicable, provided that in neither case shall such expansion have the effect of increasing the facility’s capacity to an amount in excess of 100 kilowatts;  

(4)  A non-residential large customer-generator may expand the capacity of its facility by an amount up to the greater of either:  

a. 50 kilowatts, or  

b. a capacity amount such that the expanded facility is sized to produce 110 percent of the customer-generator’s annual kilowatt-hour on-site usage, as clearly demonstrated through the customer-generator’s documentation of any consecutive 12 months within the previous 2 years;  

(5)  No such expansion under (3) or (4) shall have the effect of increasing the facility’s capacity to a level in excess of one megawatt. Expansion of a net-metered facility by or for a non-residential customer-generator smaller than the applicable limitation shall allow the customer-generator to continue to be grandfathered under the applicable net metering tariff, while any such expansion in excess of the applicable limitation hall result in the entire net-metered facility losing its net metering grandfathered status under the applicable net metering tariff; and  

(6) Any facility expansion or other modification shall be reported to the distribution utility within 30 days of expansion or modification, or earlier if so required under the utility’s distributed generation interconnection procedures.
