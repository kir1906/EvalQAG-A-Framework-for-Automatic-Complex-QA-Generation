 ## Summary : 
 **This rule applies to new buildings seeking construction permits on or after
January 1, 2025.**  

In 2023, Delaware [HB 11](https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail/130288) was
enacted, adding a provision for "Solar-Ready Zones" to the commercial building
code. These rules apply to new commercial buildings with a foundation
footprint of 50,000 square feet or more.  

Solar-Ready Zones are sections of the building's roof or overhang reserved for
future installation(s) of solar photovoltaic or solar thermal energy systems.  

Solar-Ready Zones shall be located on the roof of buildings up to 5 stories
above grade with low-slope roofs or slanted roofs facing 110 to 270 degrees
from true north. Zones must also comply with Solar Ready Zone - Commercial
rules from the International Energy Conservation Code
([IECC](https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IECC2021P1)) and comply with
requirements from ASHRAE Standard 90.1.  

**Exemptions:**

  * Buildings with existing permanent on-site renewable energy systems, 
  * Buildings with Solar-Ready Zones which are shaded for 70% of annual daylight hours, 
  * Locations with attestation from a solar energy design professional that the solar radiation is not suitable for a Solar-Ready Zone, 
  * Cases where a design professional certifies that extensive rooftop equipment, green roof areas, skylights, or other obstacles would prevent Solar-Ready Zone placement.

**Requirements:**

Construction documents must indicate:

  * The Solar-Ready Zone
  * Conduit from the Zone to the electrical service panel or hot water system
    * The main electrical panel must have at least one 2-pole breaker for future solar installations labeled as "For Future Solar Electric"  

  * Structural design loads of the roof
  * The total Solar-Ready Zone area must not exceed 40% of the roof area
  * The Solar-Ready Zone shall be a single area or small sub-zone areas
  * Each Zone shall be at least 5 feet on its shortest dimension
  * Solar-Ready Zones shall be free from obstructions including pipes, vents, and HVAC equipment
  * A certificate must be displayed conspicuously near the electrical panel or water heating system, indicating the solar-ready zone.
