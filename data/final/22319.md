One key differentiator between EVs and Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles is the fuel. EV fleets rely on charging infrastructure, much of which is beginning to be deployed across the nation. This physical network of EV chargers that “fuels” EVs by transferring electricity from the grid into vehicles is a key element of successful fleet electrification.

# Electric vehicle charging overview  

Electricity is the “fuel” for an electric vehicle (EV) similar to how gas is the “fuel” for a gas vehicle. To charge an electric vehicle, the vehicle needs to be plugged into an electrical outlet or a charging device. EV chargers are also referred to as Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). The electricity flows from the grid through the charging device and into the vehicle. Given that electricity is the “fuel” for these vehicles, it’s important to familiarize yourself with terms such as kWh, kW, amps and volts. Similar to mpg on a car, EVs don’t all go the same distance on a given amount of electricity, and the distance can depend on the weather, driving habits and other factors. A vehicle’s battery size is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh) and it’s the amount of electricity a battery can hold. To charge an EV battery, the EVSE have a rate of electricity they output in kilowatts (kW). If you run a 7 kW charger for 1 hour it will deliver 7 kWh of electricity to a vehicle’s battery.  

# Some of the factors that contribute to a fleet operating profile include:  

Return to base: Fleets may find it easier to charge their EVs at their own facilities instead of relying on public charging infrastructure.  

Fixed routes with relatively short daily mileage: EVs currently are better suited for routes that operate within a well-defined range, with enough downtime to allow for the battery to charge.  

High utilization scenarios: Applications with high vehicle utilization (high annual mileage) help maximize fuel costs savings to achieve a favorable total cost of ownership.  

We can help your business address the increasing demand for charging accessibility. As your trusted energy advisor, let us help you prepare your facility’s electric service to support electric vehicle charging both at the depot and on route.

Workplace Charging. Employers install Level 2 charging at their workplace for employees to charge their personal vehicles during the day while they are in the office, so they are ready for the commute home.  

![](images/19c26152fdc3deb996075360d7ecc37fe5c78e7675e86e8578a2388e72221763.jpg)  

Fleet Charging. Companies are also installing fleet chargers. These chargers will often be found onsite at a facility but are meant for company vehicles, rather than employees’ personal vehicles. Fleet charging can be publicly available or private to the fleet, depending on the need of the company.

# Charging at your business  

When considering EV charging for your business, it’s important to consider three potential users of your EV chargers:  

![](images/00f94d43399c05d8c10636cecca36d6af9382873dd3cb5351226bf4a81efc45c.jpg)  

# The benefits are many:  

•	 Businesses are providing EV charging to bring in new or additional customers.   
•	 Workplace charging is an appealing employee motivator that can help attract and retain a cutting-edge workforce.   
•	 Businesses that electrify their fleet can better support sustainability goals and take advantage of a lower total cost of ownership for electric vehicles.  

The cost of electricity depends on your fleet operating profile, managing when the EVs charge, at what power level and for how long. The energy grid is ready for fleet electrification today, but the infrastructure needed to provide electricity to a given location is highly site-specific. This is why it is so important to engage with us early to plan the most effective strategy for your vehicle electrification. We are here to help review your goals and plans to help evaluate and implement what you need.

# Transition to electricity  

If your goal is to transition from conventionally fueled vehicles (gasoline and diesel) to battery EVs there are several important elements to understand. You may already be familiar with some of these issues from your existing operations but new factors that are specific to EVs can include:  

•	 Choosing the right infrastructure for your fleet   
•	 Utility infrastructure for your fleet — system upgrades   
•	 Understanding your EVSE options   
•	 Purchasing electricity for your fleet   
•	 Managing your EV charging costs  

Reviewing these factors for EVs can help you evaluate your vehicle needs, charging equipment options and site selection criteria.  

Choosing the right infrastructure for your fleet  

How much energy will each vehicle need over the course of your daily operations? How long does it take to deliver that energy to charge your vehicle?  

Starting with these initial questions will help you select EVSE that can support your fleet with charging in timely manner. Reviewing your fleet needs and charging options can also help charge your vehicles in a cost-effective manner and forecast the costs of your EV charging.  

Vehicle manufacturers can help estimate the EV energy consumption for your operational needs. We are accustomed to fuel economy in gasoline and diesel, where a miles per gallon figure is better when the number is higher. Electric Vehicle fuel economy is better when the kWh per mile is lower. Gas is like bowling, and EV charging is like golf — lower scores are better! Having vehicles that draw less power for each mile traveled translates into greater savings for you.  

1.	Calculate how much energy will be needed per charge for each EV you purchase. This will be the EV’s energy consumption rate multiplied by the miles traveled between charging events.  

2.	The total charging energy require­ ment for the fleet is simply the sum of the energy requirements for each vehicle during that charging window.

# Determine your business charging needs  

Identifying the operational needs of your business such as fleet usage or customer/employee charging options is one of the first things we need to do. Finding the right charging infrastructure is dependent on how much energy your fleet will need over the course of an average day, how long the fleet vehicles are available to be charged on-site and how many may be charging at the same time.  

Faster charging is typically more expensive because it requires a higher power demand on the grid. Depending on operational needs, vehicles that are only available to charge for short time periods will require faster charging speeds to deliver the same amount of energy as those vehicles that can be charged over longer periods of time.  

# There are opportunities to manage and control charging in the most cost-effective manner. Some options include:  

•	 Maximize available charging time. For example, charging at a lower power over a longer duration generally will reduce electric costs.   
•	 More than one vehicle per charging station.   
•	 Consider routes and use cases. For example, staggering the depot return times of fleet vehicles so that charging windows begin at different times.   
•	 Manage charging station power. Most EVSE vendors offer networking and cloud-based services (fees may apply). Having networked chargers allow the business to visualize and analyze charging data and activity. Such a system can be programmed so that the maximum power demand of an individual station does not exceed a certain threshold.  

Supplement grid energy with on-site generation or energy storage.  

![](images/6611c722396b69c73285cd2aed9c9397399c845509864d44ef0e8cc05d18d698.jpg)  

There’s no one-size-fits-all formula for a business to determine which or how many charging stations its fleet will need. Vehicle type, vehicle routes, idle time and battery size are crucial factors in choosing the charging speed of your stations. However, we can help you optimize your charging needs while keeping your total cost of ownership in check.  

# Choose the right infrastructure

For conventionally fueled fleets, the unit price of diesel is independent of how the vehicles operate. A company that operates diesel-fueled trucks may be able to buy diesel at $\$3.00$ per gallon, regardless of whether the fleet has two trucks or 20 trucks and regardless of when they refuel. Fleet electrification is a new paradigm: the fuel costs (the costs of electricity) and the upfront infrastructure costs are highly dependent on the fleet operating profile, specifically when the EVs charge, at what power level and for how long.  

EV and charging equipment selection: EVs and charging equipment (i.e., EVSEs) need to be selected to meet the fleet’s operating requirements.  

Fleet operating profile: Each EV in the fleet will have its own operating profile (miles driven per day, hours of operation, hours available to charge). The aggregate of each of the individual EV operating profiles at a given location is the overall fleet operating profile.  

Load profile: The EV and EVSE choices and the fleet operating profile (how the EVs will charge) will together determine the load profile at the facility.  

Cost of electricity: Fleets can apply their load profile to the electric rate options to estimate the costs of electricity.  

Cost of electric infrastructure upgrades: Fleets can work with Exelon’s utilities to evaluate the electric service needed and any applicable electric infrastructure upgrades.  

# With the estimated EV fleet energy consumption from your manufacturer, you can start to develop your basic load profile.  

Energy needed per charge: Calculate how much energy will be needed per charge for each vehicle to be purchased.  

Total charging energy requirement: Identify your total charging energy requirement by adding up the charging needed per vehicle for your charging window.  

Average power required to charge: Determine the charging hours for your EV fleet vehicles. These may be at your facility or charging while en route during the day. As an example, delivery vehicles may only be available in the fleet yard from 8:00 PM to $6{:}00\mathsf{A M},$ a ten-hour charging window.  

![](images/b8a09418070335150c6159a3f8eb9ac938800e453215951da39fb08eb652d1f7.jpg)  

# Charging window examples  

EVs that are only available for a short period of time will require faster charging speeds to deliver the same amount of energy as those EVs that can be charged over a longer period of time. The figure below illustrates the difference in power demand when EVs are charged:  

Four-hour window — 175 kW peak power  

Ten-hour window — 75 kW peak power  

Load profiles can become more complex when EVs require different charging periods over different rates. The figure below illustrates three EVs that arrive at different times, but all deploy at the same time in the morning. Fleets may have multiple charging windows per day, depending on how they are used.  

EV 1: Ten-hour window — 10 kW peak power EV 2: Six-hour window — 20 kW peak power EV 3: Four-hour window — 25 kW peak power

# On-going infrastructure maintenance and support  

Performing maintenance on your EVSE is generally considered simpler than maintaining gas and diesel refueling equipment. Initially, maintaining your EVSE will involve unfamiliar components and procedures, which may require training, knowledge and skills. You can significantly reduce EVSE maintenance by incorporating the following considerations into design site planning. Ask prospective EVSE vendors about:  

Housekeeping pads: Installing these under EVSE posts can limit exposure to heavy rain, snow and dust.   
Screen protection: Using protected screens that are oriented   
away from direct sun exposure minimizes overheating, avoiding malfunctions.   
Collision protection: Installing bollards and clear signage can protect the EVSE from accidental vehicle collision, particularly in poor-visibility conditions.   
Cord length/management: Using shorter cords and controls to   
securely store cords when not in use limits your EVSE cord exposure to moving vehicles and people.  

Once your EVSE is up and running, best practices call for a regular maintenance schedule to help maximize your EVSE’s useful life. You can enlist the help of your EVSE vendor to understand and implement these practices:  

•	 Turn off the power to your EVSE equipment before conducting maintenance.   
•	 Routinely inspect cords, plugs and cord storage devices for wear and tear or misuse.   
•	 Clean plugs, including pins, with a light detergent and a nonabrasive washcloth to eliminate buildup of grit or grime, which can compromise your EVSE’s efficiency.   
•	 For DC fast chargers, inspect air conditioning or other cooling filters for clogs or buildup.   
•	 Inspect the area surrounding the EVSE for changes that could compromise the equipment’s integrity, such as cracked pavement, flooding, access barriers or compromised building structures (for wall-mounted EVSE).   
•	 Review data reports for unusual results or other signs of error in the network or cloud-based communications platform.   
•	 Compare EVSE data with your utility bills to confirm that the equipment is functioning as intended.

# Path to Clean  

# The path to meeting our operational emissions goal  

Our plan starts with a tangible 2030 milestone that aligns to net-zero operations by mid-century. Operations-driven emissions are those that can be directly impacted by our daily employee operations, processes and procedures. These emissions sources include buildings’ energy use, our fleet vehicles, and Sulfur hexafluoride $(\mathsf{S F}_{6})$ insulating gas used in our breakers and our gas delivery infrastructure. We target these sources where we can effect change as our focus areas for action. Near-term actions to get us to our 2030 milestones are highlighted below. We are also laying a foundation during this decade for advanced technology and solutions in each area through collaboration, pilots and partnerships.
