 ## Summary : 
 **_Note: The[Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf#page=993)
created the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/) with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

Kentucky has conducted three rounds of funding under two Requests for
Proposals, one in Summer 2023 and another in Spring 2024. So far a total of
$27.2 million in funding has been allocated. Details on future funding rounds
are not currently available. More details on Kentucky's NEVI process can be
found in [Kentucky's Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment
Plan](https://kyevcharging.com/application/files/4916/9660/7455/2023KY_EV_StatewideNEVIPlan.pdf).
