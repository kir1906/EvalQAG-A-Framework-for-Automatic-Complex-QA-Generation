# How Does Beat the Peak Work?  

The program is simple! During times when the cost to purchase and produce power for members is high, we issue Beat the Peak alerts. During these alert periods, we ask members to conserve energy. We recommend you turn off unnecessary lights, delay the use of major appliances like dishwashers and dryers and turn your thermostat up a few degrees in the summer and down a few degrees in the winter. Over the years, the program has saved members more than $\$40$ million. Because DEC is a not-for-profit utility, those savings are passed on to you in the form of affordable rates. This program is becoming even more important as energy costs rise. After Oct. 1, 2023, if you have one of the Co-op's plug-in peak indicators, please throw it away or recycle it at a DSWA electronic recycling center. The technology used to send signals to the indicators is antiquated and costly to maintain.  

All Time Total Savings \$42,001,462

Members who install or who have already installed a thermostat connected to Wi-Fi are eligible for the program. Members will agree to allow DEC to adjust their thermostats a few degrees during summer Beat the Peak alerts. By allowing your Co-op to automatically adjust your thermostat a few degrees, you’ll be helping to lower the cost of power for all members.

# 3. Beat the Peak with Your Electric Vehicle!  

Co-op Members who have purchased or who are considering the purchase of an electric vehicle (EV) can play a new and important role in our Beat the Peak program. Delaware Electric Cooperative will offer a one-time $\$25$ billing credit and an additional $\$5$ monthly billing credit during the summer months for EV owners who do not use their EV chargers during Beat the Peak alerts. To receive the credit, you must sign up for the Optiwatt charging program.

# 4. Beat the Peak Electric Rate  

DEC's Beat the Peak rate gives members another way to save money by using electricity during off-peak hours. Members who sign up for the Beat the Peak rate will pay more for the power they consume from 3:00-6:00 p.m. (on-peak hours) and less for the power they consume from 6:00 p.m.-11:00 p.m. or 5:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m. (off-peak hours). Members will pay a significantly lower price for power consumed from 11:00 p.m.-5:00 a.m. (super offpeak hours). By using energy during times when it is cheapest for the Co-op to purchase or produce power, members will be rewarded with lower electric bills. If you can delay the use of major appliances until later in the evening or very early in the morning, this rate could reduce your monthly electric bill. For example, if a member is able to shift 10 percent of their energy use from on-peak hours to super off peak hours, they could lower their monthly bill by 8 percent.  This rate could also help members with electric vehicles save money, since the chargers consume a lot of electricity. This rate is designed for members
