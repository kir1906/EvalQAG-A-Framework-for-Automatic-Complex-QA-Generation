# ACCELERATING CLEAN TRANSPORTATION (ACT) SCHOOL BUS: FLEET DEPLOYMENT  

# The Challenge: Reduce Barriers to Electrifying School Buses  

Despite the long-term savings and health benefits of going electric, school districts face barriers to electrifying their school bus fleets. Challenges that school districts encounter include  

Higher up-front costs for buses and associated charging infrastructure, compared to diesel buses   
Implementing necessary depot upgrades   
Training drivers and mechanics during the transition to electric buses   
Coordinating with third-party transportation providers for districts that choose to lease their buses  

# About ACT School Bus Fleet Deployment  

The ACT School Bus Fleet Deployment program offers school bus fleets flexible funding for depot upgrades and purchases of electric school buses and associated charging infrastructure. Participating fleets also have the opportun English to work with MassCEC's consultant team to address the gaps in technical  

knowledge impeding school bus fleets from electrifying, in areas such as coordination with stakeholders, equipment selection, procurement, and project implementation.
