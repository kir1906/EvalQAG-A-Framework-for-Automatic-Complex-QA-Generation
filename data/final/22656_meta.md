 ## Summary : 
 **_Note:[The Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf#page=993)
created the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/) with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

Montana's [deployment
plan](https://deq.mt.gov/files/Energy/Transportation/MontanaElectricVehicleInfrastructureDeploymentPlan2022.pdf)
was developed by the state's Department of Transportation (MDT) and the
Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). The goals of the deployment plan
include developing EV charging corridors along key travel routes, considering
by 2030 30,000 state residents and 100,000 visitors will be projected to drive
EVs through the state. Other goals include establishing a connection of EV
networks for rural communities to use, amongst other planning visions. An
[updated state
plan](https://deq.mt.gov/files/Energy/Transportation/2023_MT_NEVI_Plan_update_FINAL.pdf)
was released in July 2023. The updates included a summary of public engagement
activities, changing market conditions, challenges, and implementation
strategies to ensure compliance with 23 CFR 680.
