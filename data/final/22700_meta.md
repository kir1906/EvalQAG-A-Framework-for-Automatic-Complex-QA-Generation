 ## Summary : 
 Yellowstone Valley Electric Cooperative (YVEC) offers rebates to members for
the installation of a solar panel array for the purpose of watering their
stock. To be eligible for the rebate, members must be in good standing with
YVEC, receiving electric service from YVEC, and the system must be installed
in an area that would normally be served by YVEC if a line extension were to
be installed for electric service to the well. For installations costing up to
$2,000, a rebate of 50% of the installed cost will be given. For installations
costing more than $2,000, a rebate of $1,000 will be given. YVEC authorizes
one rebate per system or up to three rebates per member. The customer is
solely responsible for the installation and maintenance of the solar stock
watering system.
