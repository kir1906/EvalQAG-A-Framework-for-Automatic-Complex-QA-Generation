 ## Summary : 
 The Sponsors of Mass Save promote the construction of new energy-efficient
homes in Massachusetts through financial incentives for residential new
construction that exceeds the Massachusetts building energy code and builds
high-performance, energy-efficient homes.  

**Eligibility**

Residential new construction homes, three stories or less, are eligible if
located within a Sponsorâ€™s service territory in Massachusetts. Homes with
master-metered gas or electric may be eligible for Mass Save [High-Rise
