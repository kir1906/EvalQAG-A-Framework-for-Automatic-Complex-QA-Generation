# Program Overview  

Fossil-fueled transportation is Vermont's largest contributor of carbon emissions and significantly impacts the state's economy and environment. The State of Vermont is actively working to electrify the transportation sector to reduce emissions and costs and meet carbon reduction targets defined in Vermont's Comprehensive Energy Plan and Global Warming Solutions Act.  

The Electrify Your Fleet incentive program was authorized by the 2023 Transportation Bill (Act 62, Section 21) to accelerate the retirement of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and help Vermont municipalities and business entities enjoy the benefits of cleaner transportation options. Combined with other potential federal, state, and electric utility incentives, eligible fleet owners have an opportunity to save thousands of dollars on clean transportation alternatives.  

# Eligibility
