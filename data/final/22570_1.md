sources such as the federal Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program.  

MassCEC offers two program opportunities: Advisory Services and Fleet Deployment.  

Advisory Services is currently open and accepting applications on a rolling basis.  

Round 3 of the ACT School Bus Fleet Deployment Program will be released in the early spring of 2024. This RFP will complement the 2023 EPA Clean school Bus Rebate round.  

Please continue to monitor both the ACT School Bus and EPA Clean School Bus webpages for timeline updates on future rounds of programming.  

# Which program is right for my school district?  

# Advisory Services  

Up to 25 school bus fleets will receive free electrification planning services under the ACT School Bus Advisory Services Program.  This program does not provide funding to buy electric school buses.  Rather, it provides technical services to public school districts and/or third-party school bus fleet operators, including  

Preparing for future funding opportunities Identifying internal approval procedures Feasibility designs   
Financial modeling   
Vehicle and charging station procurement plans   
Educational materials  

# Fleet Deployment  

The ACT School Bus Fleet Deployment Program offers to each selected school bus fleet up to $\$2.5$ million in flexible funding for electric school buses, associated infrastructure, construction, and staff time.  Selected school districts can also receive free technical advice from MassCEC's hired consultant team. Services offered by the technical consultant for school districts include  

Assistance with the electric school bus procurement process   
Electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) charging infrastructure selection, procurement, and installation   
Recommendations for depot upgrades   
Data collection on electric school bus performance   
Plans for future electrification

# Program Recognition

# Program Backgrounds  

# ACT School Bus  

MassCEC developed the ACT School Bus program to complement EPA's Clean School Bus funding or other federal funding opportunities. With the completion of its third round of funding, ACT School Bus Fleet Deployment serves as a continuation of the ACTNow school bus projects, and extends ACT4All’s equity focus by prioritizing high-needs and low-income school districts.  

Launched in November 2019, the first round of ACT programming, Accelerating Clean Transportation Now (“ACTNow”), resulted in the deployment of $\$1.4$ million in funding and leveraged over $\$2$ million in external cost share funding across nine clean transportation projects, three of which were school bus electrification grants and six of which reduced air pollution in environmental justice communities. The second round of ACT programming, Accelerating Clean Transportation for All $\left(^{\prime\prime}\mathsf{A C T}4\mathsf{A}||^{\prime\prime}\right)$ , focused on addressing transportation needs and burdens in disadvantaged communities. MassCEC awarded $\$5$ million in funding through this equityfocused program across ten clean transportation projects. Selected projects, announced in February 2022, spanned a range of topic areas including e-bike pilots and EV consumer education and are being deployed in various environmental justice neighborhoods and Gateway Cities across the Commonwealth.  

# EPA School Bus  

Following passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021, U.S.  

Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program will provide $\$5$ billion over five years (FY22-26) for clean school bus programming. Under the program, half of the funding is dedicated to zero-emission school buses and half is for clean school buses (including zero-emission, propane, and natural gas buses). Eligible recipients for this first round of funding included state or local governments that provide bus service, contractors who sell or arrange financing for the sale of clean school buses, nonprofit school transportation associations, and tribes, tribal organizations, and tribally controlled schools. EPA prioritized applications from organizations that serve high-need school districts and low-income areas, rural school districts, and tribal school districts.
