 ## Summary : 
 Maryland enacted legislation in 2013 ([H.B.
226](https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb0226/?ys=2013rs))
establishing a carve-out for offshore wind energy within its Renewable Energy
Portfolio Standard
([RPS](https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/1085/renewable-
energy-portfolio-standard)). The legislation directed the Maryland Public
Service Commission to determine the actual target, but provided that the
requirement cannot exceed 2.5% of retail electricity sales in 2017 through
2020. The limit increases to 10% of retail electricity sales in 2025.

Beginning in 2026, Maryland Statutes establish a specific megawatt (MW) target
for offshore wind energy development, requiring 400 MW in 2026 and 2027,
increasing to 800 MW in 2028, and 1,200 MW in 2030 and thereafter.

[Maryland Public Utilities Code ยง
7-704.1](https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Laws/StatuteText?article=gpu&section=7-704.1&enactments=False&archived=False)
separately established a _goal_ of reaching 8,500 MW of offshore wind energy
capacity by 2031.
