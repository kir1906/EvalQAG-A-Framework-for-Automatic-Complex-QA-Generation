PILOT applications are reviewed and approved by the Center City Revenue Finance Corporation Board.  

Before applying for a PILOT, the applicant must either own the subject property, or have an option to purchase the property.  

A complete PILOT application must demonstrate financial need using detailed pro formas comparing the development’s financial performance with and without a PILOT.  

Within 12 months of PILOT approval, the PILOT recipient must close the PILOT. Closing a PILOT includes:  

Transferring the property title to the CCRFC Entering into a PILOT lease with the CCRFC Paying the PILOT closing fee  

Once a PILOT is closed, the PILOT lessee has 24 months to complete construction before the awarded PILOT years begin.  

The PILOT recipient must comply with the DMC’s Equal Business Opportunity (EBO) Policy during the construction process to retain the awarded PILOT.

# ACTIVE PILOT PERIOD  

![](images/4e95002dcd3aae74abd4b23982901449244fb3d4b0e7c97761703324be8b6706.jpg)  

While the PILOT is active, the PILOT lessee is responsible for maintaining the property in good condition, making timely annual PILOT payments to the city and county, and providing the DMC with any compliance documentation for affordable housing and other program requirements.  

A PILOT lessee may transfer or sell their interest in a PILOT property, subject to CCRFC approval and the payment of a transfer fee.  

At the end of the term specified in the PILOT lease, the property title is returned to the PILOT lessee, and the owner begins paying full property taxes.  

# DOWNTOWN MEMPHIS PILOT PROGRAM  

# ADMINISTERED BY THE CENTER CITY REVENUE FINANCE CORPORATION (CCRFC)  

The Downtown Memphis PILOT (Payment-In-Lieu-Of-Taxes) Program is a financial incentive designed to encourage commercial real estate development in and around the Downtown Memphis area by partially freezing property taxes at the predevelopment level for a limited period of time.  

PILOTs are not entitlements. In order to qualify for a PILOT, an applicant must clearly demonstrate that their project requires a PILOT in order to be financially viable, and meets all the other eligibility requirements.   
• The CCRFC Board reserves the right to reject any application, or place conditions on its approval.   
• Following approval, the project must comply with all the terms of the approved PILOT, including the DMC’s Equal Business Opportunity (EBO) policy (p. 3).  

# PROGRAM OVERVIEW  

# HOW THE PILOT WORKS  

A PILOT slows the rise in property taxes that would normally occur following a significant investment to a property, but does not decrease taxes from their present amount, or fully freeze them.  

In order to receive the tax benefits of a PILOT, the property owner transfers the title to the CCRFC before the start of construction, which grants the property tax-exempt status.   
• The CCRFC then executes a PILOT lease with the former owner, which specifies annual PILOT payments that must be made to the city and county.   
• Annual PILOT payments are equivalent to the property’s pre-development property taxes, plus taxes on 25 percent of the property’s increase in value since the close of the PILOT –  payments during the PILOT period are always higher than the property’s pre-development property taxes. At the end of the term specified in the PILOT lease, the title is transferred back to the PILOT lessee, and the property owner begins paying conventional property taxes based on the property’s full valuation.  

# ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS  

In order to be eligible for a PILOT, applicants must meet the following requirements:  

• The project must be located within the program’s boundaries, which include the Central Business Improvement District (CBID), the adjacent area bounded by the Parkways, and the Fairgrounds (Attatchment II: Boundary Map).   
• Hard construction costs must make up more than 60 percent of the total project cost.   
• The project must pass a “but for” test that determines that the project would not be financially feasible without a PILOT.   
• Applicant must own the property or have an option or other right to purchase the property.   
• Residential projects with 50 units or more must be able to comply with the requirements of the DMC’s Affordable Housing Program (p. 4). Any development project that is already under construction, excluding stabilization, site preparation, or utility work, is ineligible for the program.  

# PILOT LENGTH  

Eligible projects qualify for a standard PILOT length of 10 years. Longer PILOTs are possible under the following conditions:  

• 15-Year PILOTs are available for projects that meet three bonus criteria from the list below. o Alternatively, multifamily projects with over 50 units can qualify for a 15-Year PILOT by providing affordable housing within the development under the terms of the DMC’s Affordable Housing Program.   
• 20-Year PILOTs can be awarded to projects that meet the requirements for a 15-year PILOT and include over $\$100$ million in total project costs.  

# PILOT Bonus Criteria  

Project includes the redevelopment  of a property certified as blighted by DMC staff.   
Project includes the adaptive reuse of an existing building.   
Project will Infill a vacant lot or surface parking lot in the Downtown Core (must be condition prior to   
acquisition).   
Project includes the renovation of a contributing structure in a National Register Historic District or an   
individually listed property on the National Register of Historic Places.   
Project will achieve LEED or Net Zero Certification.   
One of the following geographic priorities can be counted: o Project is located in a Memphis 3.0 Accelerate Anchor. o Project is located in a designated retail node or the Downtown Core. o Project is located in a census tract with poverty rate over $20\%$  

# PILOT PAYMENTS  

During the term of the PILOT, payments in lieu of taxes to the City of Memphis and Shelby County will be based on the property’s assessment at the time of closing, plus 25 percent of the property’s increase in assessment since closing.  

An example of a typical PILOT payment calculation is given below:  

![](images/6ef785387e5897afc20aa1dcb43b348976f13f708bda393f2bfb103f3480fe2d.jpg)  

<html><body><table><tr><td>AssessmentIncrease</td><td>$9,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>25%ofAssessmentIncrease (Increment)</td><td>$2,250,000</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-Development Assessment + +Increment</td><td>$3,250,000</td></tr></table></body></html>  

PILOT Payment Calculation: $\$3,250,000$ Current Year’s Millage Rate  

Projects that are awarded a PILOT must comply with the requirements of the DMC’s Equal Business Opportunity (EBO) Program:  

The applicant must make a best-faith effort to reach out to Minority and Women-owned business Enterprises (MWBEs) for the contracting opportunities associated with the project, with the goal of reaching 25 percent MWBE participation in the project’s eligible costs. Eligible costs include all hard costs, as well as soft costs associated with professional services like architecture and engineering.   
The outreach process must be documented by the applicant to provide evidence of compliance.   
• DMC staff will work with the applicant to identify necessary steps for the project’s EBO compliance, to provide resources and support throughout the compliance period.  

• Failure to comply with the EBO policy will result in a termination of the project’s PILOT award.  

# AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM  

Multifamily projects with over 50 units of housing must comply with the requirements of the PILOT Affordable Housing Program. Projects have the choice to comply with this requirement  in two different ways:  

• A project can provide affordable housing within the development during the term of the PILOT.  

o At least 20 percent of the building’s residential units must be rented to households making 80 percent or less of the Memphis MSA’s Area Median Income (AMI).   
o These affordable units must reflect the building’s mixture of unit sizes and types, and not merely consist of the smallest units in the building.   
o Rents for these units must be capped at $30\%$ of monthly income for households making 80 percent or less of the Memphis MSA’s AMI.   
o The DMC will provide PILOT applicants with current income and rent limit information to assist with the compliance process.  

• A project can choose to pay a fee which will be used to fund other affordable housing projects in Downtown Memphis. o The fee will be equal to 2 percent of the project’s total costs, excluding the PILOT fee. o Projects that choose to pay the affordable housing fee rather than providing affordable housing in the development are limited to a PILOT term of 10 years.  

# PROGRAM FEES  

# Closing Fee  

If a PILOT is granted, a closing fee equal to 1 percent of total project costs will be due upon closing. The closing fee will be capped at a maximum of $\$1$ million. Project costs shall be determined on the basis of the total budgeted cost for a project including all soft and hard costs, but excluding CCRFC fees. The proposed budget included in a PILOT application will be considered the applicant’s certification of the project’s likely cost. An updated budget may be requested at the time of a PILOT’s closing to calculate the final fee.   
• Closing Deadline Extension Fee If a PILOT does not close within one year from approval, the applicant may request to extend the closing deadline for one year, subject to an additional $\$2,500$ closing deadline extension fee.   
Transfer Fee The transfer of a lessee’s interest in a PILOT property requires the approval of the CCRFC, and the payment of a PILOT transfer fee equal to 1 percent of the project’s value.  

# 1. ELIGIBILITY SCREENING  

Potential applicants should contact the Downtown Memphis Commission (DMC) to evaluate their eligibility for the Program. DMC staff will ensure that all eligibility criteria are met prior to submitting an application.  

# 2. PRE-SUBMITTAL CONFERENCE  

A meeting with an assigned staff member must be held prior to submission of the application. The purpose of the meeting is to acquaint all parties with the scope of the project and any related issues.

# 4. DMC STAFF REVIEW AND RECOMMENDATION  

Based on the application, staff will prepare a report that will include a summary of its evaluation and its recommendation. This report, along with the application, will be sent to the CCRFC Board prior to its monthly meeting, and will also be made available on the DMC website.  

# 5. CCRFC BOARD MEETING, REVIEW AND APPROVAL  

The CCRFC Board generally meets on the second Tuesday of every month at 9:00 am. Meetings are typically held at the DMC offices at 114 North Main Street. At this meeting, the application and staff report will be made available for public viewing and comments.  

Staff will present each application and its recommendation at the meeting. The applicant, or an authorized representative, must be present. The Board may ask the applicant to make brief remarks regarding the project, at which time the Board may further ask questions of staff and the applicants before making its decision.  

The Board will approve, deny, or postpone a resolution of the application at this meeting. The Board reserves the right to deny or reject any application, or to reduce or increase any PILOT Term request. The Board  

also has the right to approve any application, based on certain conditions being met. Applicants will be notified in writing of the Board’s resolution.  

# 6. DESIGN REVIEW BOARD APPROVAL  

All applicants pursuing PILOTs must have their projects reviewed by the DMC Design Review Board (DRB).   
For details regarding the DRB review, please refer to the separate DRB Application.  

# POST-APPROVAL STEPS  

# CLOSING  

The deadlines and related policies for approved applicants are as follows:  

A PILOT may be vetoed, in writing, by the Mayor of the City of Memphis with respect to City of Memphis taxes, and the Mayor of Shelby County with respect to Shelby County taxes, within 14 days of written or electronic notice to the respective Mayor the Board meeting where such PILOT is approved.   
• After approval by the Board, the applicant will have up to one year to close a PILOT lease.   
• If the lease has not been closed within one year, an applicant may request a closing deadline extension of one year, subject to the $\$2,500$ extension fee. Projects are limited to one extension, and the extension fee shall not be credited against the closing fee   
• If a PILOT does not close prior to the termination of the extension period, the project must be resubmitted, reviewed, and approved by the CCRFC.   
• All PILOT leases will be closed in the name of the applicant or party designated in the application as the owner of the project. Prior approval of CCRFC Board of Directors will be required for substitution of another party as lessee under any PILOT lease upon closing thereof. Upon closing, title transfer will occur and the PILOT lease will be registered with the City of Memphis and Shelby County.   
• The PILOT lease will provide for a construction period of up to 24 months before the PILOT benefits begin and the awarded PILOT years start running down.   
• If the applicant abandons the project and leaves it not cared for and unoccupied for more than 60 days, or as stipulated in the lease, the PILOT may be terminated.  

The following must be provided on closing:  

$\bigcirc$ Phase I Environmental Assessment   
$\bigcirc$ Liability insurance on the property with $\$3,000,000$ in coverage. If the project is valued at less than $\$1,000,000$ , then only $\$1,000,000$ in coverage is required.   
o The PILOT closing fee (p. 4)  

# PROJECT COMPLETION  

Upon completion of any project subject to a PILOT lease, the project shall be reviewed to determine if the project was completed as set forth in the application with respect to such plans and specifications approved by the CCRFC and the DRB. If the project as completed would have received a PILOT lease of fewer years than it was initially granted, the term of the PILOT lease may be reduced appropriately.  

# COMPLIANCE & REPORTING  

During the term of the PILOT, PILOT lessees are required to provide the following information to DMC staff annually:  

• Current occupancy rates and rent levels for all leasable commercial and multifamily space in the development, or equivalent occupancy and revenue data for hotel rooms.   
If the development is providing affordable housing under the terms of the DMC’s Affordable Housing Program, the PILOT lessee must provide documentation that demonstrates the requirements of the policy are being met, including income certifications for the tenants of the development’s affordable units, and the current rent for each affordable unit.   
• DMC staff will request all required information annually, and provide all necessary forms for submitting the information.  

Failure to pay any payments in lieu of taxes for property under a PILOT lease can result in termination of the lease. Written notification of any delinquent payments will be sent to the lessee and its lenders by certified mail. The lessee must pay the delinquent payments in lieu of taxes within 30 days of receipt of the notice (or such later date as is provided for the lessee’s lender to cure). If the lessee or its lenders fail to pay the delinquent payments in lieu of taxes in the time period provided in the notice, CCRFC can terminate the lease or take any other action to enforce the lien for delinquent payments in lieu of taxes.  

# SELLING OR TRANSFERRING A PILOT PROPERTY  

Any sale, transfer, or assignment of the lesse’s interest in a PILOT lease must be approved by the CCRFC.  

• Transfers are subject to a transfer fee of 1 percent of the project value. In the event that a lender forecloses on a lessee’s interest in a PILOT lease, this action will not be considered an assignment of the PILOT lease, and will not be subject to Board approval or the transfer fee requirement, as long as the lender holds the interest in the PILOT lease for resale, and not for investment purposes (defined as holding the property for more than 18 months). If all the current lessee’s interest in the property is being transferred,  project value shall be determined on the basis of the total value given (including, without limitation, cash and assumption of debt). If only a portion of the lessee’s interest in the property is being transferred, project value shall be determined on the basis of the project’s appraisal.
