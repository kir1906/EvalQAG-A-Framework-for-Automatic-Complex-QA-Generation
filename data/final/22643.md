Individuals can submit additional questions or requests for clarification to DOT.DriveElectric@illinois.gov  

# General  

# What is the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program?  

● The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program is a grant program that supports electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure in the United States. The program is funded by the Department of Energy and provides funding for local governments, public and private entities, and Tribal communities to install electric vehicle charging stations.  

# Which authorities govern the NEVI Program?  

The NEVI Formula Program is authorized under Paragraph (2) within the Highway Infrastructure Program heading in Title VIII of division J of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, enacted as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).  

# What is the Illinois Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan?  

● The Illinois Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan, developed by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), is the state’s approach to deploying public charging infrastructure that provides convenient, accessible, reliable, and equitable electric vehicle charging throughout the state. The current plan builds upon the 2022 plan approved by the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation on September 29, 2023. To learn more about IDOT’s EV infrastructure plan and additional programs for Drive Electric Illinois, you can view these resources at the Illinois Drive Electric website.  

# What is the goal of Illinois’s NEVI Program?  

● Through Phase 1 of the Illinois NEVI Program, IDOT aims to develop a fully built out network of public EV charging stations along Alternative Fuel Corridors (AFCs), designated by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Once funding has been allocated to achieve a full build out of Illinois’ AFCs, subsequent phases of the Illinois NEVI Program will focus on installing EV charging stations on US Routes and Scenic Byways as well as filling remaining EV charging gaps throughout the state. The Illinois NEVI Program will be a key component to fulfilling the state’s goal of having 1 million registered EVs in the state by 2030.  

# What are Alternative Fuel Corridors (AFCs)?  

● AFCs are designated corridors around the national highway system equipped with infrastructure to facilitate a comprehensive network of electric vehicle charging, hydrogen, propane, and natural gas fueling infrastructure. The first phase of the NEVI plan is a full build out of EV charging stations along AFCs to provide a consistent charging experience that meets the same set of baseline standards nationwide.   
● You can find a map and list of Illinois AFCs in both the updated IDOT EV Infrastructure Deployment Plan 2023 and in the IDOT NEVI NOTICE OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITY (NOFO) located on the Illinois Drive Electric website. An interactive map is available on the IDOT website at Electric Vehicle Designated Corridors (arcgis.com)  

# What are the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Standards and Requirements?  

● The NEVI Standards and Requirements are found in a final rule as published in the Federal Register issued by the USDOT and FHWA on February 28, 2023. The standards and requirements establish EVSE regulations, setting minimum standards and requirements for projects funded under the NEVI formula program. See National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Standards and Requirements for more details.  

# What is Round 2 of the IL NEVI Program? New: 11/15/2024  

● Round 2 involves utilizing IL NEVI funds to complete the build out of public EV charging infrastructure, at minimum, every 50 miles along designated EV corridors in Illinois, per federal guidance. Following Round 1, approximately 20 more locations within the state have been identified as sites that will be needed to achieve a full buildout of Illinois’s AFCs.   
● Future phases of the IL NEVI Program will follow the full buildout of Illinois’s AFCs and are detailed in the updated IDOT EV Infrastructure Deployment Plan 2023. The end date of NEVI funding, as of this document’s publication, will be Sept. 30, 2028.  

# What is the deadline of the Round 2 application? New: 12/05/2024  

● IDOT has extended the Round 2 application deadline to January 31st, 2025 at 11:59pm CT. This is an extension from the original deadline of December $17^{\mathrm{th}}$ , 2024.  

# Will there be subsequent phases of grant applications available through the Illinois NEVI Program?  

● Yes, while the focus of Phase 1, including Round 1 and 2, will be to complete a “full build-out” of Illinois’ AFCs, future phases of Illinois NEVI funding will expand the EV charging network in the state beyond AFCs. The IDOT EV Infrastructure Deployment Plan 2023 provides more detail into IDOT’s preliminary priorities for future rounds of Illinois NEVI funding.  

# Where can I find a map and list of the Illinois EV charging station eligible locations for Round 2?  

You can find a map and list of the 20 designated eligible locations in the Illinois NEVI Round 2 NOFO located on the Illinois Drive Electric website. An interactive map is available on the IDOT website at Electric Vehicle Designated Corridors (arcgis.com).  

# Which exits are eligible at location #20 under the Round 2 NOFO? New:  

# 01/02/2025  

Eligible exits for Location ID #20 are 12, 15, and 25. An early version of the Round 2 NOFO published on the Drive Electric website contained a typo in Table 3 Section 4.3 listing the eligible exit as “5”, rather than “15” for this location. The Round 2 NOFO was updated with the corrected exit number shortly after initial publication. IDOT is adding this FAQ in case any prospective applicants downloaded the earlier version of the NOFO with the incorrect exit number. In addition, please continue to refer to the designated EV charging map for eligible sites and exits here.  

# What is Justice40 and how does it apply to the NEVI Formula Program?  

● To address racial equity and the climate crisis, the Justice40 Initiative sets the goal of delivering 40 percent of overall federal investment benefits in climate and clean energy, including sustainable transportation, to disadvantaged communities. Illinois is committed to realizing equity benefits as part of the NEVI program through technical analysis and targeted stakeholder engagement. Additionally, applications that incorporate equity principles, are located within or near Justice40 communities as defined in the Climate and Economic Justice Screening tool, or conduct community and stakeholder outreach will receive additional points as outlined in the evaluation criteria of the Illinois NEVI Round 2 NOFO located on the Drive Electric website.  

# Do Buy America requirements apply to the NEVI Formula Program? New: 11/15/2024  

Yes. The applicant and all members of the project team shall comply with FHWA’s Buy America Requirements in 23 U.S.C. 313 and 23 CFR 635.410, and in the Build America, Buy America Act (BABA) (Pub. L. No. 117-58, div. G §§ 70901–70927). ● The Build America, Buy America Act (BABA) ensures that EV chargers acquired through the NEVI Formula Program will be assembled in the United States and comply with BABA requirements for manufactured products. Applicants should describe in detail their ability to comply with BABA in their application.  

● In February 2023, FHWA published a Federal Register Notice that establishes a temporary waiver of Buy America requirements for EV charging stations. This waiver is broken into two phases. The first phase includes equipment manufactured before July 1, 2024, and installed before October 1, 2024. The second phase includes equipment manufactured and/or installed after these dates until a future date to be determined by FHWA.  

Key dates and restrictions from FHWA are summarized in the following table:

# How do I register through the GATA Grantee Portal?  

Applicants must register and pre-qualify through the GATA Grantee Portal here, unless they are a Local Public Agency. ● While Local Public Agencies are exempt from GATA registration and pre-qualifications requirements, they are still required to have a valid UEI number and complete both the Local Public Agency Risk Assessment and the Programmatic Risk Assessment. The Local Public Agency Risk Assessment only needs to be completed once annually. Applicants are encouraged to begin the GATA registration process as early as possible, as the turnaround time can be up to 14 days.  

# Is the owner/operator of the charging site required to own the property or land the site will be on? New: 11/15/2024  

● No, an applicant is not required to own the property or land the site will be on. However, in the application, the applicant must provide the appropriate site ownership documentation if they are the site owner. If the applicant and site host are different entities, the applicant must provide a signed Form 6 Letter from Site Host and site ownership documentation.  

# Is there a limit to the number of eligible locations for which an applicant can apply?  

No, applicants may apply for multiple eligible locations (as defined by location IDs in the   
IDOT NEVI NOFO), but may not submit more than one application per eligible location/location ID.   
IDOT intends to award up to 20 eligible locations at sites that promote an effective, robust buildout of EV charging infrastructure. IDOT reserves the right to award sites in a   
manner that promotes an effective buildout of EV charging infrastructure, results in the   
greatest number of viable sites being awarded and maximizes the funding distribution to eligible applicants.  

# Can an applicant apply for multiple sites within an eligible location/location ID?  

● No, applicants may not apply for more than one site in each eligible location/location ID.   
● Additionally, please note that one application must correspond to only one proposed site.  

# Within each of the 20 eligible locations, will only one project be awarded funding? Or is it possible that more than one site will be awarded funding within an eligible location?  

● To ensure that IDOT meets its goal in Round 2 to award the number of sites required to achieve a full build-out of the state’s designated AFCs, IDOT intends to award one site per eligible location.  However, IDOT reserves the right to make more or fewer awards upon receiving the full pool of applicants and assessing the submissions in relation to the program’s goals and objectives.  

# How is IDOT determining who is awarded NEVI funds?  

● IDOT is reviewing applications based on a merit-based review process and evaluation criteria for site proposals. Evaluation criteria can be found in Section 6.2 of the posted Illinois NEVI Round 2 NOFO.  

# Who is responsible for procuring the sites? Shall the contractors have to lease or purchase the sites?  

● IDOT will accept applications from both site owners and lessees. If you are not the site owner, you must provide a Letter from the Site Host in your application that demonstrates an agreement for the contractor to install the chargers and use the site for a full five years.

The Programmatic Risk Assessment is only required to be completed once per applicant.  

The IDOT Subrecipient Risk Assessment is only required for Local Public Agencies and needs to be completed once, annually.  

# How should applicants complete GATA Form 1: Uniform Budget Template?  

# New: 11/15/2024  

• An accurate Uniform Budget Template (UBT) is required for an applicant to receive an award through the Illinois NEVI Program. To minimize revisions in the post conditional award phase, Applicants are encouraged to follow the instructions below and complete the UBT to the best of their abilities.  

1. Applicants must complete all required fields in the UBT Form. Section A of the form should be populated based on the funds that will be requested from the State of Illinois. Section B of the form should be populated based on the match funds that will be provided by the applicant.   
2. Applicants are required to populate Page 5 FFATA Data Collection Form with the information of the entity that will be receiving the grant funds from the State of Illinois. Additionally, in the Project Detail Description field on Page 5, Applicants should include the Location ID and full address of the project.   
3. Before submitting, applicants should ensure that the dollar amount totals for each item are consistent throughout the form.   
4. When submitting the UBT, applicants should ensure that the UBT remains in the editable format, as this will facilitate a smoother revision process if one is required post conditional award.  

Regarding the statement in section 3.4 of the NOFO, “The price for charging shall be clearly displayed and be calculated at a reasonable market rate,” can IDOT define what they mean by “reasonable market  

rate”? New: 11/15/2024  

• IDOT will not publish a calculation on which to determine what constitutes a "reasonable market rate." Applicants should understand what would be considered an unreasonable rate for charging and should only charge what would be considered a reasonable market rate. IDOT would expect that rates would be competitive in the marketplace and IDOT reserves the right to intervene if the rates are determined to be unreasonable. Applicants will be required to forecast a reasonable rate of return $(\%)$ on investment for their project cost proposals, as well as explain how financial revenue from the proposed site will be used.  

# What information is required in the pricing structure question on Form 2 (Technical Application)? New: 11/15/2024  

Applicants will be asked to describe the anticipated pricing structure for the EV charging station. Ways to capture this information can include providing the expected pricing model, rate structure, and/or any additional fees that may be applied. The price to charge for drivers should be fair and reasonable and designed to be competitive with other fuels. Additionally, the price to charge should be easy to understand for drivers.  

The guidance states that applicants must provide resumes of key personnel, including the Project Manager, Utilities Coordinator, Construction Manager, EVSE Installer/Electrical Contractor, Operations and Maintenance Manager, EVITP Certified Electrician(s), other subcontractors, and consultants. Is IDOT looking for a resume of an individual for each of those categories? Or would an overview of the history and experience be sufficient?  

Applicants must provide resumes for each of the key personnel listed above. The resumes should include information such as education history, certifications related to the project, and professional history. Resumes must be no longer than one-page.  

# If the utility provided a cost range in cell D57 of Form 5 (Utility Form), what value should an applicant enter in cell C11 of Form 3 (Detailed Cost Estimate)?  

If the utility provides a cost range in cell D57 of Form 5, the applicant should enter the midpoint value in cell C11 of Form 3. o For example, if the utility provides an estimated cost range of $\$70,000$ in the Utility Form, the applicant should enter $\$80,000$ in the applicable cell of the Cost Estimate. If the applicant does not enter the midpoint value (e.g., if they enter the low end of the range provided by the utility), IDOT will contact the applicant via email to revise this cell to the midpoint value of the range.  

Can IDOT provide specific guidance on the “appropriate certifications” that are being requested in Attachment C: EVSE Equipment Certification?  

EVSE equipment certification must demonstrate compliance with 23 CFR 680. Specifically, all chargers must be certified by an Occupational Safety and Health Administration Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory. DCFC should be certified to the appropriate Underwriters Laboratories (UL) standards for EV charging system equipment.  

Can you clarify if the letter from the site host must include “binding” language, and if there is flexibility to obtain site host permission to install chargers without binding language at the time of application submission?  

• Yes, the intent of the Letter from Site Host is to evidence a binding, non-exclusive commitment of the Site Host to allow the Applicant to develop the Site Host's property. Applicants must use the Letter from Site Host Form provided in the application materials on the Illinois Drive Electric website. Applicants must complete the “TO BE COMPLETED BY APPLICANT” section, provide the letter to the Site Host to complete the “TO BE COMPLETED BY SITE HOST” section and then submit the form as part of the application submission.  

# How do I know which is the correct Utility that will be servicing my project site? New: 11/15/2024  

• IDOT has developed a new tab in Form 5 (Utility form) that serves as a source for applicants to determine the utility and utility point of contact for their project site based on the location ID. If you are having trouble identifying your site’s appropriate utility, please contact DOT.DriveElectric@Illinois.gov.

• Per 23 CFR 680, the workforce installing, maintaining, and operating chargers must have appropriate licenses, certifications, and training. Electricians who install, operate, or maintain the EVSE must meet one of the following requirements:  

1. Certification from the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program (EVITP).   
2. Graduation or a continuing education certificate from a registered apprenticeship program for electricians that includes charger-specific training and is developed as part of a national guideline standard approved by the Department of Labor in consultation with the Department of Transportation.   
3. Certification from the Illinois Commerce Commission EV Charging Station Installer Program.  

# Site Planning & Technical Questions  

# Is the 1 mile for the exit requirement strict? If a site is located at 1.1 miles, would they be excluded from the process?  

• Yes, a site location must be located one-mile from the end of a designated exit (as the car drives). Site locations will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis and any site not within one driving mile from an eligible exit will fail.   
• You can access a map of the designated AFCs for IDOT NEVI Round 2 here. Note: IDOT may accept applications for sites located up to five miles driving distance from an eligible exit. However, an award will depend on the site receiving a discretionary exception from FHWA.  

# How can I confirm if my site is eligible?  

• IDOT cannot make a determination regarding eligibility until we receive a completed application submission. However, the information outlined in Section 4 of the NOFO, along with the provided map, should aid in assessing site eligibility. Please refer to Table 3 of the NOFO, which lists the eligible exits along the designated interstate for Round 2 of the program. To be eligible for consideration under this NOFO, your site must be situated within a one-mile driving distance from the off-ramp of an eligible exit. It's important to measure this distance based on the actual driving route rather than the shortest straight-line distance between two points. We suggest that you use Google Maps to measure the driving distance from the intersection point of the offramp and the street to the location of the charging station.  

# Can a charging station be constructed in phases with fewer than the minimum number of ports installed initially, and the remainder installed at a later time?  

No; 23 CFR 680.106 (b) requires a minimum of four ports at each station, and these four ports must be operational and available for public use at the time of project close-out.  

# Can a charging station be “split” between multiple sites?  

• No. Per 23 CFR 680.106 (b) each charging station must have at least four networkconnected charging ports and be capable of simultaneous charging of at least four EVs.  

# Will sites be required to include NACS adapters along with CCS?  

• No, sites will not be required to incorporate NACS adapters in their plans. Applicants are welcome to include plans for NACS adapters in addition to the minimum NEVI requirements in their application but should be aware that the cost for adapters to accommodate non-CCS charging will be limited to a reimbursement of $\$200$ per port for the adapter hardware.  

# Will applicants receive additional points for incorporating NACS adapters during the evaluation process?  

• No, applicants will not receive additional points for including NACS or any other adaptors to support non-CCS charging. However, applicants should note that cost for adaptors to accommodate non-CCS charging are eligible but will be limited to a reimbursement of $\$200$ per port.  

# If a location already has a charger/charging port, can this be included in the 4-port minimum requirement?  

Yes, as long as the existing charger/charging port is a Direct Current Fast Charger and meets the technical NEVI requirements in 23 CFR 680 (charging port is capable of simultaneously charging at 150kW or greater with a CCS Type 1 connecter, etc.).  

# Do applicants need to own the EV chargers, or can they lease them?  

Applicants are allowed to choose a lease option for charging equipment rather than purchase it. Lease fees are only eligible costs if they are paid in advance through a contract.  

# Will permits need to be obtained by the site contractor?  

Yes, permitting will be the responsibility of the site contractor in accordance with the locality of where the work is being performed. Applicants are encouraged to begin the permitting process as soon as possible to allow ample time for your site to meet full compliance.  

# What are the requirements for site data sharing? Who is responsible for data collection and reporting?  

• Grantees will be responsible for cybersecurity as it relates to owning, operating, maintaining, and dating sharing for the EVSE. Within an application submission, applicants must provide a robust cybersecurity plan detailing, at minimum, protection measures for data storage, management, transfers, and specifics related to NIST 8473 Framework and NIST SP 800-18 Guide.   
• As per the NEVI Final Rule, grantees are required to submit an Annual Data Submittal, Quarterly Data Submittal and One-time Data submittal. The Joint Office of Energy and  

Transportation is developing a data platform, the Electric Vehicle Charging Analytics and Reporting Tool (EV-ChART) that will be used for all data submittals required by the NEVI Final Rule. Grantees will be required to submit data to IDOT in the standardized specified by the Joint Office. For more information about the contents of the three required reports refer to 23 CFR 680.112.  

# What is the $97\%$ uptime requirement for sites?  

• Per 680.116, a charging port is considered “up” when its hardware and software are both online and available for use, or in use, and the charging port successfully dispense electricity in accordance with requirements for minimum power level. Charging station port uptime, T_outage, and T_excluded must be calculated on a monthly basis for the previous twelve months in accordance with the equation in 680.116(b).  

# How will the $97\%$ uptime requirement be enforced for sites?  

Uptime will be enforced through the small percentage of the requested reimbursement withheld to encourage sites to meet the performance goals outlined in 23 CFR 680. If a site does not meet the uptime requirement, a formula will be used to determine how much of the withholding will be forfeited. If a site is not in compliance, it will be notified and given the opportunity to return to compliance by restoring function to the ports that are not in service.  

# Can sites include solar, energy storage, or can they only be powered by utility power? New: 11/15/2024  

• Yes, for the Round 2 application, applicants will be asked to provide a comprehensive and detailed analysis regarding the decision to include, or not to include distributed energy resources (DERs) as part of the proposed project site. DERs are included in the eligible costs, but applicants must adhere to the requirements in the Federal NEVI final rule surrounding the use of solar and storage for a NEVI site.  

# Is 24/7 access to site amenities required? New: 11/15/2024  

• While 24/7 amenities are not required to be included in site plans, applicants should be aware that the inclusion of amenities within site plans are a part of the evaluation criteria for the NOFO.   
• For Round 2, applicants will be asked to provide a brief description for each of the site amenities detailing how charging site users will have access to them and their level of availability.  

# Are EV charging stations that support only medium and heavy-duty vehicle charging allowed under this NOFO?  

• No, as specified in the NEVI Final rule, EV charging stations located along and designed to serve users of designated AFCs must be available for use and sited at locations physically accessible to the public 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, year-round.  

Hence, EV charging stations that support medium and heavy-duty vehicle charging are eligible, so long as they are open to the public for light-duty vehicle charging as well.  

# Who will be responsible for providing security for the EV charging station, once built?  

• The grantee will be responsible for operating and maintaining the site during the fiveyear grant period and beyond. As outlined in the 23 CFR 680.106, grantees must implement physical and cybersecurity strategies to ensure charging station operations protect consumer data and protect against the risk of harm to, or disruption of, charging infrastructure and the grid. Refer to 23 CFR 680 for additional details on physical and cybersecurity strategies required by the NEVI Formula Program.  

# Are all chargers at a site required to be ADA compliant or is having a percentage of the chargers fully ADA complaint and signed acceptable?  

Elements of EV charging stations must comply with ADA, ABA, and Section 504 requirements and be accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including those using wheelchairs or other assistive equipment. The existing ADA and ABA standards address many aspects of accessibility for buildings and sites applicable to EV charging stations but do not specifically address EV charging stations. To address this gap, in July 2022, the U.S. Access Board issued Design Recommendations for Accessible Electric Vehicle Charging Stations. FHWA recommends that charging stations be designed and constructed according to the Access Board's Recommendations to demonstrate compliance.  

• The U.S Access Board recommendations specify two aspects of accessibility that need to be considered when designing EV charging stations, as outlined below. Applicants should refer to the U.S Access Board recommendations document for more detail on these two aspects.  

1. Accessible Mobility Features: Accessible mobility features primarily concern the size of the vehicle charging space, providing access aisles, how and where the chargers are installed, and the physical operability of the charger.  

2. Accessible Communication features: All EV chargers should have accessible communication features and operable parts. This enables EV chargers to be used by people who are deaf or hard of hearing, little people, and other people with disabilities who do not need accessible mobility features (like access aisles) to use an EV charger.  

Each EV charger in the EV charging station must include accessible communication features and there must be at least one ADA-compliant parking space that incorporates accessible mobility features and is equipped with access to EV charging infrastructure. Applicants should note that converting accessible parking spaces to EV charging spaces is not recommended, especially when use will be restricted to electrical vehicle charging only. The ADA and ABA standards prohibit an alteration that decreases accessibility below the requirements for new construction $(\S202.3.1)$ . If an existing accessible parking space is converted to an EV charging space, the minimum number of accessible parking spaces required by table 208.2 (found in U.S Access Board recommendations  

document) must be recalculated based on the total number of parking spaces provided, and accessible parking spaces may need to be added elsewhere.
