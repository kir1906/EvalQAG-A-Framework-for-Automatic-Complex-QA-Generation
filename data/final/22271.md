# Charging Your EV  

Before you purchase an EV, learn about the three types of chargers and how long it might take for you to charge your vehicle.  

# Level 1  

# Level 2  

# Level 3  

120-volt (V) plug and can be plugged in to a standard wall outlet. Most plug-in EVs come with this type of charging equipment.   
2-5 miles of range for each hour of charging.   
Most often used at home.   
Typically used to charge their vehicles at home overnight.   
Electric vehicles can be charged with a 240V plug, typically used in homes.   
10-60 miles of range for each hour of charging.   
These units can fully charge an electric car battery in as little as 2 hours, making them a good choice for both homeowners and businesses.   
Overall home charging satisfaction is highest among EV owners who install a Level 2 permanently mounted charging station.  

Direct-current (DC) fast-charging equipment typically found along corridors with heavy traffic and other public locations. DC rapid chargers use a 480V connection to provide 60-100 miles of range for each 20-minute charge. $\cdot$ These chargers require highly specialized equipment to install and maintain and typically are only used in commercial and industrial applications.  

# Purchase a charger at the TEP Marketplace and receive an instant rebate  

Note: Before purchasing an EV charger for your home, you may need to consult an electrical contractor to determine if your home's electrical system needs any modifications. The type of charging system you should install will depend on the type of vehicle you choose. Installation of higher-voltage systems may require permitting and upgrades to your home's electrical facilities.  

# Charging On the Go  

Charging your EV when you're away from home is easy
