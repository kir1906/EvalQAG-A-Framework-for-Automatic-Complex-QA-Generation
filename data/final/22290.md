# 1.0 SMUD Commercial EV Program overview  

To align with statewide goals to reduce carbon emissions, the SMUD Commercial Electric Vehicle (EV) Program supports the growth of commercial vehicle electrification and the increased need for electric vehicle service charging equipment (EVSE) by offering direct incentives, as well as tailored consulting or installation services, for both fleet vehicles and installed on-site EVSE. SMUD is looking to lead other municipal utilities in working with customers, contractors, and industry, along with state and local governments, to expand EV adoption and support EV market transformation.  

# 2.0  CALeVIP 1.0  

The CALeVIP 1.0 Sacramento County Incentive Project closed to new applications on October 24, 2021. For updates on CALeVIP applications submitted before October 24, 2021, please email CommercialEV@smud.org or Center for Sustainable Energy at sacramentocalevip@energycenter.org. Customers participating in the CALeVIP program cannot receive both program incentives on the same unit. However, after maximum limits are reached with CALeVIP, additional qualifying handles in a project may go through the SMUD Commercial EV Program.  

# 3.0  SMUD Commercial EV Program  

The SMUD Commercial EV Program offers incentives for new Electric Vehicle chargers (EVSE) installed within its service territory. Incentives for business electric vehicles were discontinued on December 31, 2023.  

Projects must be fed from a new or existing SMUD commercial account and meet all criteria listed in this manual.

# Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS)  

 In support of greenhouse gas emission reduction, the State of California adopted the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) in 2009. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) developed regulations to implement the LCFS; these regulations provide for the generation of LCFS credits for electricity used as a transportation fuel. SMUD may receive LCFS credits pursuant to the LCFS Regulations and spends LCFS revenue (not SMUD ratepayer funds) on qualifying transportation electrification categories to benefit current or future EV drivers in California.   
 As outlined in the program terms and conditions, any project receiving incentives under the SMUD Commercial EV Program (or CALeVIP) will be automatically enrolled in SMUD’s LCFS credit sharing and will receive biannual checks for their LCFS credits per the LCFS credit sharing program requirements and thresholds listed in Section 7.0. Exceptions noted below: o Publicly facing DCFC units $\ge50\upkappa\mathsf{W}$ are not eligible to participate in LCFS credit sharing o Level 2 projects with 10 or fewer handles are not eligible to participate in LCFS credit sharing o EVSE installed at multi-family sites and connected to a commercial service (e.g. common area parking lots) are not eligible to participate in LCFS sharing  

# 3.2 Additional program requirements Product eligibility:  

All qualifying vehicles must be Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV). Plug-in Hybrids (PHEV) are not eligible for commercial incentives.  

All EVSE must have J1772, CCS1 (Combo), CHAdeMO, or Tesla (NACS) connectors/handles/ports   
SMUD Commercial EV Program incentivized projects can participate or stack incentives from other funding programs and grant opportunities (excluding CALeVIP 1.0 Sacramento County Incentive Project) o Participants must disclose if project is receiving funding from additional sources (grants, incentives, etc) and their corresponding monetary values   
All projects must receive a building permit and the project must be finalized by Authority Having Jurisdiction. Self-inspecting agencies are allowed.  Please contact program staff for requirements.  

# Site requirements:  

 All EVSE units must be located at and powered by a SMUD commercial account. In new construction or renovations, projects meeting (but not exceeding) code minimum requirements are not eligible for incentives. Only projects that go beyond code can receive incentives based on the scope of work by which the code minimums are exceeded.  

# Project costs:  

 The project costs are those costs specifically associated with implementing the EVs and EV chargers receiving incentives. Allowable project costs include engineering, construction, equipment, materials, removal, recycling, overhead, tax, permits, shipping and labor. Project costs can be documented by purchase order, contract, invoice or similar.   
 SMUD requires the applicant to submit project costs during the Commercial EV application process. Incentives cannot exceed $100\%$ of project costs. o Upon project completion, SMUD will request proof of project costs to determine if the reserved incentive amount needs to be adjusted. Participants must disclose additional funding sources and amounts; SMUD’s incentive may be adjusted accordingly  

# Electrical and metering requirements:  

SMUD Electrical Service Requirements (ESRs) must be followed, including both   
Commercial Electric Vehicle Program Engineering Specification T017 and Commercial and   
Industrial Engineering Specification T004.   
All EVSE energy consumption on site must be recorded through a SMUD EV data meter or   
qualifying new service revenue meter with a separate account (revenue meter must feed   
EVSE only), unless specifically exempt from metering requirements per below: o Project consists of no more than 10 Level 2 handles and no other chargers (ex. DCFC units) are on site.  The project does not wish to ever expand in the future to more than the 10 Level 2 handles at the site. If a project ever expands beyond a max of 10 total handles or installs a DCFC, then the customer will be required to retroactively install an EV data meter.  

Projects most likely to proactively install an EV data meter up front include any project that the applicant believes will grow beyond 10 total handles, or the applicant desires to monetize their LCFS credits though SMUD’s LCFS credit sharing such as: workplace, fleet, and/or publicly facing EVSE installs at high trafficked locations such as shopping or dining locations.  

o Projects most likely to not install an EV data meter include smaller sites with 10 handles or less which are primarily designed for limited use or unable to expand due to parking constraints. Project applicant and host customer understand that projects without an EV data meter cannot join SMUD LCFS credit sharing. Applicants can elect to install an EV data meter even if their project meets the above criteria for exemption.

The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) plays a key role in the process communities undergo to plan for and encourage the development of housing that meets the needs of everyone in California's communities.   
Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency utilizes a variety of tools to promote and support the development of affordable rental housing in the City and County of Sacramento.  

# Parties in the SMUD Commercial EV Program/process  

The SMUD Commercial EV Program is available to SMUD commercial customers who receive electricity from SMUD.  

The Host Customer must be the utility customer of record at the location where the Electric Vehicle Service Equipment (EVSE) is located. The Host Customer may also act as the Applicant. In circumstances where the Host Customer is not currently an active SMUD customer, the New Service request work order number and SMUD designer contact information must be submitted along with the application. The Equipment Owner is the owner of the equipment at the time the incentive is paid. In the case of a third party-owned Equipment (a leased EVSE unit, for example), the third party (or lessor) is the Equipment Owner. The Applicant is the primary contact for the application process and may also be the Host Customer, the Installer, and/or Equipment Owner. The Incentive Payee will be the recipient of the incentive and may also be the Applicant, Equipment Owner, Installer, or Host Customer.  

LCFS Distribution Payee will be the recipient of the shared LCFS credit value when the Project qualifies for LCFS credit sharing and may also be the Applicant, Equipment Owner, Installer, or Host Customer.  

Installers will be the entity that installs the EVSE units for a Project, and must possess a Contractors State License Board A, B, or C-10 contractor’s license. In all cases, Equipment must be installed in conformance with the manufacturers’ specifications and all applicable electrical and building codes and standards.  

# SMUD vehicle and EVSE contractors list  

SMUD’s Commercial Contractor Network can provide a list of qualified and licensed contractors available to design and install EV charging equipment.  

In addition, outside agencies such as CALeVIP Connects publish lists of EVSE companies that many of our customers find helpful. SMUD provides a link to the CALeVIP Connects list for information and example only.  

# Project or fleet size  

Incentives are limited by program parameters per Section 3.1. These limits are applied per site and per year. Larger projects may be considered on a case-by-case basis and any additional funds over the program limits would only be issued to projects at program year-end if funds are still available.  

# Equipment warranty  

To be eligible for program incentives, all EVSE equipment must have a minimum 3-year warranty provided in combination by the manufacturer and/or installer to protect the purchaser against defective workmanship, vehicle or component breakdown.  

# SMUD EV data meters  

Unless exempted above in Section 3.2, all EVSE on site must be installed and recorded separately through a SMUD EV data meter or qualifying new service revenue meter with a separate account (revenue meter must feed EVSE only). The installer must provide the SMUD EV data meter socket; the EV data meter will be provided by SMUD at no cost.  

Customers are highly encouraged to contact SMUD prior to installation to coordinate meter location and equipment specifications. Information regarding Commercial EV data meters and SMUD’s Electrical Service Requirements (ESRs) can be obtained at the following web sites:  

Commercial & Industrial T004   
Commercial Electric Vehicles T017  

# Permanency  

EVSE equipment is intended to be in place for the duration of its useful life. Only permanently installed and hardwired EVSE are eligible for incentives. This means that the vehicle or EVSE project must demonstrate adequate assurances of both physical and contractual permanence prior to receiving an incentive. Physical permanence is to be demonstrated in accordance with industry practice for permanently installed equipment. All equipment must be secured to a permanent surface. Any indication of portability, including, but not limited to, temporary structures, quick disconnects, unsecured equipment, trailer mounted EVSE or platform, will deem the equipment ineligible.  

# Inspections and certifications  

SMUD reserves the right to perform inspections for each project. The first, if required, will be after the Commercial EV application and required documents are received by SMUD. This initial inspection may audit the accuracy of the application, physical location, and interconnection suitability of the project. The second inspection may be performed after the project is installed and receipt of the  

remaining Commercial EV application documents have been received by SMUD. This inspection may document the final vehicle and EVSE specifications, equipment characteristics and/or compliance with SMUD ESR T004 and T017.  

SMUD will not perform a formal NEC compliance inspection; however, wiring inconsistencies or concerns with electrical connections may be addressed. If a project fails an inspection by either SMUD or the local authority having jurisdiction, the applicant will have 30 calendar days from date of inspection failure to bring the project into compliance, or the project will be dropped from the incentive program. If funds are still available, the project may reapply for an incentive once the deficiencies are addressed.  

# Incentive payments  

Incentive payments can be made to any of the following:  

Host customer  Equipment manufacturer Installation contractor Applicant  

In no instance will SMUD split an incentive payment among the parties. The parties are free to have their own arrangements, but SMUD will only issue one payment.  

# Codes and standards  

The installation must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations and industry standards, including without limitation, city and county building codes, American Society for Testing and Materials-International (ASTM), Uniform Mechanical Code (UMC), National Electric Code (NEC), Uniform Building Code (UBC), California Building Code (CBC) and manufacturer installations specifications, as appropriate. EVSE installations must meet the highest industry standards in terms of safety, workmanship, reliability and performance.  

SMUD requires proof of all required city/county/state building permits for all EVSE installations. Installation shall be considered complete when the relevant city/county/state building permit has been signed off by the relevant authority and submitted to SMUD.  

In no event is SMUD responsible for damages caused by the installation contractor. Any damage caused by the contractor or workers to the customer’s property or premises shall be repaired at the contractor’s expense.  

# 5.0 Participating project process flow  

In fall 2022, SMUD launched a new online application portal (PowerClerk) for the Commercial EV incentive program. This platform replaces the legacy process that used PDF forms. Incentive applications started on the legacy process will be closed out using the PDF forms. All new incentive applications will use the online application portal.

# 7.0  SMUD Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credit sharing option  

Project sites which meet qualifying kWh usage thresholds quarterly will be eligible for biannual LCFS credit sharing payments through the SMUD Commercial EV Program. These LCFS credit sharing payments are in addition to any project incentives paid earlier.  

The LCFS credit sharing option is for a five-year term and is renewable if agreed upon by both parties. SMUD will capture and report all the LCFS credits following CARB guidelines. SMUD will then bundle those credits and quarterly sell the credits on the open market. While SMUD anticipates sales to occur on a rolling quarterly schedule, SMUD reserves the right to adjust the sales schedule based upon its business requirements and/or relevant state regulations or legislation.  

Under this option, SMUD may share with the LCFS distribution payee up to $90\%$ of a qualifying project’s base or non-incremental LCFS credits. Additionally, SMUD offers up to $50\%$ of the enhanced or incremental LCFS credits generated in connection with a qualifying project due to SMUD procuring zero carbon electricity for the participating project site. SMUD does not guarantee the availability of enhanced or incremental LCFS credits for any project.  

SMUD keeps the remaining LCFS credits to use for transportation electrification programs, projects, and other CARB allowable transportation electrification uses in SMUD’s service territory.  

# 7.1 LCFS credit sharing qualifying guidelines  

To qualify for participation in the LCFS credit sharing option, an EVSE project must register and consume 12,500 kWh of CARB recordable EV charging usage on the SMUD EV data meter during the quarterly reporting/usage period.  

Projects must continue to consume at least 12,500 kWh per quarterly usage period in CARB reportable usage to remain qualified for LCFS credit sharing payments. If a project drops below the qualifying level in quarterly reporting period, it will not receive payment for that period. Payments will resume once a project hits the minimum kWh threshold in a quarterly period. Any LCFS credits generated during the non-qualified period will not be rolled over to the next payment period.  

Publicly accessible DCFC units $\ge50\upkappa\mathsf{W}$ , of which SMUD has not registered LCFS credits, are ineligible for LCFS credit sharing.  

Qualifying Level 2 projects that do not install a SMUD EV data meter are ineligible for LCFS credit sharing. SMUD will not register LCFS credits from these data meter exempt projects.  

# 7.2 LCFS credit sharing distribution payments  

The LCFS distribution payee’s LCFS payment will be based upon the actual dollar value SMUD receives from the sale of the LCFS credits generated quarterly by the LCFS distribution payee’s EVSE project.  

LCFS distribution payee will receive a statement biannually (twice per year) with their LCFS payment confirming the number of LCFS credits sold, the price they were sold at, and the calculation used to arrive at the payment.  

The LCFS disbursement check will be issued based on the table below. This check will include the qualifying two quarters’ LCFS credits value. Thereafter, the LCFS distribution payee will continue to receive checks on the regularly scheduled biannual payment date as long as their project remains qualified and generates the minimum usage threshold in the given quarter.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Biannual paymentperiod (2 Quarters)</td><td>Check processed on or about</td></tr><tr><td>Q1:January1 1 - March 30 Q2:April 1-June 30</td><td>November30</td></tr><tr><td>Q3: July 1 - September 30 Q4: October 1 - December 30</td><td>May 31</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Payments are mailed on or about May 31 and November 30. Payments reflect the LCFS credits generated and sold from the quarterly sales in the prior biannual billing period.  

In the unlikely event that SMUD is unable to finalize the sale before processing the LCFS distribution payee’s biannual LCFS payment, the LCFS payment will continue based upon the stated price of the active contract. If the value of the LCFS shares price changes between payment issuance and final sale, SMUD reserves the right to adjust LCFS distribution payees’ next biannual payment to true up the actual value received from the LCFS sale against the amount paid on the biannual payment.  

# 7.2.1 LCFS credit sharing payment example  

Here is an example of a project receiving payment for their LCFS credit sharing credits. To allow for the sale of the LCFS credits, the project will qualify for LCFS credit sharing payments after the project consumes 12,500 kWh of CARB reportable usage during the three-month quarterly period. The payments will be for the credits generated during the quarterly participation period.  

# Example payment and credit calculation:  

Customer ABC installed an EV project that completed and went live in the January/June biannual period, and records 12,500 kWh of CARB reportable usage during each quarter in the period.  

Customer ABC becomes eligible for LCFS credit sharing payments.   
This 25,000 kWh of CARB reportable usage (two quarters of 12,500 kWh in each quarter) generated 21 LCFS base/non-incremental credits.   
SMUD supplied zero carbon electricity to Customer ABC’s 12,500 kWh of CARB reportable usage, which generated an additional 7 incremental/enhanced LCFS credits.   
SMUD sold both the base and enhanced LCFS credits on the open market for $\$150$ credit. SMUD shares the value of those credits with Customer ABC according to program terms and conditions at $90\%$ of base/non-incremental LCFS credits and $50\%$ of incremental/enhanced LCFS credits.   
Customer receives a payment of $\$3,360$ on or about November 30.   
Biannual payments will continue for the term of the agreement if the project stays qualified, wit normal biannual payment windows of on or about May 31 and Nov 30 each year.
