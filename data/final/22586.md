# Green up your commute  

A great way to reduce your carbon footprint – hop onto an electriccharged, battery-powered ebike. These bikes give your own pedal power a boost when you want it. You can go farther, or faster. Charge up with GMP’s power that’s $100\%$ carbon free and $78\%$ renewable, and you have a green ride for your daily commute!
