Join our Improve & Save program to make energy efficiency upgrades while paying for them over time.  

Get Started  

# What is Improve & Save?  

It’s a unique offering that lets customers pay for energy efficiency upgrades in their home or rental, over time, and as part of their energy bill.  

Duke Energy pays for the upgrades plus installation upfront and even handles ongoing maintenance on qualifying equipment for the life of the term. Also, generous money-saving incentives are automatically applied to further   
reduce project cost, and the remaining balance   
is repaid over 10 years on the property’s electric bill. No loans, no credit checks.

# How it works  

Duke Energy will begin with a free energy audit by sending a trained energy advisor to your   
door who’ll look for the largest energy savings opportunities in your home and suggest targeted upgrades tailored to you.

# What happens if I don’t pay my bill?  

This cost is part of your utility bill and subject to the same rule for disconnect. The equipment will not be repossessed from the property for nonpayment.

There are no additional fees at the end of the term. Any additional warranties and maintenance plans will become the responsibility of the owner.

Equipment failure will be covered under an extended warranty that includes labor and material for the life of the term. An installation contractor will be notified to schedule an appointment for repairs on behalf of the owner. If negligent behavior is the root cause of equipment failure, the customer may be responsible for additional repair cost.

No, your payments are fixed over the established term.  

# Can the term of my repayment period be shortened or extended?  

No. However, you may request a full payoff amount and pay for the improvements at any time.  

# How do you determine how much electricity I will save?  

An analysis will be formed utilizing a custom savings model specific to your home that provides estimated savings based on recommended upgrades.  

# How do you determine the term of the repayments?  

The term is set to 10 years.  

# Do you offer insurance?  

Insurance will be the responsibility of the owner in their homeowners insurance policies.  

# What happens if I move out?  

If you move out then the payment will become the responsibility of the next account holder at the home.   
The charges are tied to the home not to the individual customer.  

# Does participating in this program exclude me from participating in other energy efficiency programs offered by Duke Energy?  

No. However, a customer may only receive one incentive for the same equipment or service.  

# Why is my home, with gas heat, not eligible for this program?  

Our energy savings calculations are solely based on homes with electric heat. Thus we cannot service customers with gas heat at this time. If you have gas heat with central AC we recommend scheduling a Home Energy House Call to identify energy inefficiencies.
