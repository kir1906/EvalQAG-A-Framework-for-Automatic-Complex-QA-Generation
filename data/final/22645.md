# BUILDINGIOWA'S EV CORRIDORS  

# UPDATE, OCTOBER 2024:  

The Iowa Department of Transportation has awarded over $\$16.2$ million to install 28 new electric vehicle (EV) direct-current, fast-charging (DCFC) stations along Iowa’s interstates.  

Funding for the EV chargers comes from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program that provides dedicated funding to construct EV charging infrastructure and supports the acquisition, installation, operation, and maintenance of EV charging infrastructure sites. Over a five-year period, Iowa will receive over $\$51$ million in federal funds which will be distributed through competitive application programs.  

A Notice of Funding Opportunity was published in December 2023 for the first application cycle seeking to deploy EV charging infrastructure along Iowa’s designated alternative fuel corridors: I-29, I-35, I-80, and I380. Applications from 80 private entities were received for the program in March. The over $\$16.2$ million in NEVI funding will be matched with more than $\$5.6$ million in private funding. The selected sites are no more than one mile from the interstate and will include a minimum of four charging ports providing continuous charging of at least 150 kilowatts of power per port concurrently.

# ABOUT THE PROGRAM  

FHWA issued guidance in February 2022 for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program, which provides federal funds for the strategic deployment of an electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The program provides up to $\$7.5$ billion to make electric vehicle chargers accessible for public use by establishing a nationwide interconnected network across the U.S., located primarily along alternative fuel corridors.  

Alternative fuel corridors are federally designated routes on major highways that allow for inter-city, regional and national travel using lower-emission vehicles. Iowa currently has four alternative fuel corridors: Interstates 80, 380, 29, and 35.  

National Electric Vehicles Infrastructure -funded Electric Vehicles Plans and charging infrastructure must:  

Be open to public and commercial fleet operators   
Use funds for electric vehicle charging stations along designated corridors   
Connect to the electric grid and be spaced no more than 50 miles apart and less than one mile from   
Interstates and highway corridors   
Be near restrooms, small businesses, and other amenities   
Address needs for electric vehicle charging infrastructure in rural corridors and under-served or   
disadvantaged communities  

disadvantaged communities  

Provide long-term operation and maintenance   
Include existing electric vehicle charging infrastructure programs and incentives   
Consider public-private or private investment partnerships   
Allow flexibility for future upgrades based on power levels and charging speeds   
Adhere to Joint Office of Energy and Transportation standards and requirements   
Consider consumer protection, cyber-security, domestic manufacturing, emergency evacuation planning,   
environmental permitting, resilience, and terrain-related issues   
Must be submitted to the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation by August 1, 2022, to avoid forfeiture of   
funds  

# WHY ARE WE INVESTING IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE?  

Iowa is a proud and nationally recognized leader in renewable energy and biodiesel and ethanol production. Our state has made a significant investment in renewable fuel infrastructure. State leaders, local communities, private companies, and utilities are making solid progress in adding electric vehicle infrastructure to our diverse fuel mix.  

Many drivers are looking for low or no-emission vehicles and manufacturers are responding by introducing a number of new vehicles. With the cost of some electric vehicles now coming close to that of gasoline-powered models, more people are looking to electric vehicles as a viable transportation option.  

![](images/525cab7d818b10056e536ff4dc6f91f19701051c8cd0bfd4ae5d2ace9d575668.jpg)  

More than 200,000 electric vehicles were sold in the United States in the first quarter of 2022. As of June 2023, approximately 12,800 EVs were registered in Iowa.  

Iowa is a transportation crossroads, with major interstates dissecting our state. As more travelers use electric vehicles for both intra- and interstate travel, it is crucial to have sufficient charging infrastructure to meet demand. The development of this infrastructure will help us remain competitive, reduce potential future emissions, and spur economic growth.  

While investment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure is important to our future, our transportation system must continue to support all types of vehicles and their fuel needs. We will remain unwavering in our support for varied fuel resources and associated infrastructure, including ethanol, biodiesel, renewable natural gas, and electric.  

# WHAT ARE WE DOING TO SUPPORT ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE?  

With an uptick in drivers choosing electric vehicles,  Iowa has developed a plan to support the needs of those drivers.  

Our Electric Vehicle Deployment Plan is part of a broader effort to create a national electric vehicle charging network along major transportation corridors. Development of the plan was funded through the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.  

Iowa’s plan was submitted to the federal Joint Office of Energy and Transportation for review and was approved  

Other statewide partners are working with us on the implementation of the plan and many details remain to be worked out. One of the activities you may be interested in is a funding opportunity for electric charging stations. Updates will be posted to this web page.  

If you’re interested in following these developments, please sign up for plan emails to receive information on future plan deployment updates and timelines.
