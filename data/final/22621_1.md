Virgin Islands Battery Energy Storage (VIBES) Rebate Program Application  

This Rebate Program is supported by: State Energy Program: Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (SEP BIL) Funding Opportunity EE0010105  

Program Launch Date: May $24^{\mathrm{th}}$ , 2024  

# Program Information  

The Virgin Islands Energy Office (VIEO) introduces the VI Battery Energy Storage (VIBES) Rebate Program. This program is made available through the State Energy Program Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (SEPBIL) SE0010105.  

The VIBES program aims to increase Energy Resiliency in the territory by lowering the cost barrier to adoption of battery energy storage options.  

The program will afford residents the opportunity to increase their energy resiliency and bridge gaps in utility services in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The program benefits will contribute both financially and environmentally to meet established goals:  

1. Increase coverage during service interruptions.  

2. Allow homeowners increased access to energy resiliency and energy independence.  

3. Low maintenance to owners- these battery systems require little to no maintenance, unlike fuel generators.  

4. VIBES is for Battery Systems with automatic whole or partial home backup only and cannot include Solar on Permits for VIBES. Stationary battery storage systems must be certified to UL9540 or UL1973  

5. VIBES systems purchased outside of vendors list are subject to increased rebate application processing time due to thorough technical review by VIEO team and the additional requirement of an approved Electrical Final Certificate from DPNR.  

6. Owners who have battery systems may be eligible for a federal tax credit. Please visit the following site for more information: https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/residential-clean-energy-credit
