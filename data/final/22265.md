# About Electric Vehicles  

There are more electric vehicles (EVs) on the road every year, including in Alaska. There are two types of EVs that charge from the electric grid. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) run solely on electricity stored in batteries, commonly with a range of 200-350 miles or more. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) have a smaller battery and modest all-electric range (often 25-40 miles) as well as an internal combustion drivetrain.  

# EV charging is generally classified in three main categories  

# Level 1  

Is slow charging usually at home from a standard 120-volt outlet. Typical power is 1-1.8 kW and can add 2-5 miles of range per hour.  

Level 2   
Is faster charging at home, commercial, or public sites with a 208/240-volt outlet or hardwired EV charger. Typical power is $5{-}19\mathsf{k W}$ and can add 10-30 miles of range per hour. Level 3   
Is DC fast charging at public sites or commercial sites. Typical power is 50-250 kW or more and can add 150- $^{350+}$ miles of range per hour.  

Check out the EV Terminology and Resources brochure for more information on EV terminology.  

# EV Incentives  

Chugach offers electric vehicle (EV) charging incentive programs to promote the use of EVs in Alaska. The programs help individuals and businesses establish charging at home, at workplaces, for fleet vehicles, and for public use within the Chugach service area by providing a bill credit after installation. The programs are helping speed the transition to electric transportation, which benefits all members by reducing rates.  

The bill credits amounts vary by program and are listed in the overview below.

# Current EV Incentive Programs  

Licants may apply for more than one program per location, but an individual charger cannot receive funding more than once f Chugach. An applicant may receive funding from other sources without affecting their eligibility under a Chugach program.

# Benefits of Electrification  

Using electricity as a transportation fuel provides a number of benefits. First, "fueling" a vehicle with electricity is significantly less expensive than fueling with liquid fuels. Another is reduced transportation emissions such as carbon dioxide, which are 60-70 percent lower when powered by Chugach, compared to gasoline. A third benefit is that the use of electricity for EV charging helps spread the fixed costs of a utility like Chugach across greater sales, which puts downward pressure on members' electric rates.  

# EV Trends  

Every six months Chugach conducts a count of electric vehicles (both all-electric and plug-in hybrids) registered in Alaska. The number of registered EVs in Alaska and in the Municipality of Anchorage (MOA) has risen steadily in recent years, as shown in the graphs.  

There are a wide variety of BEV and PHEVs registered in the MOA, and the number of EVs is the fastest growing population in the state. at approximately 50 new EVs per month. As of the end of June 2024, there were about $1{,}700\mathsf{E V s}$ registered within the MoA,for a density of approximately 60 EVs per 10,000 residents. The most common BEV brand is Tesla at over $40\%$ of allBEVs,followedbyChevy and Ford. The most common PHEV brand is BMW, followed by Jeep. The most popular 2023-2024 model year electric vehicles are the Tesla Model Y, Chevy Bolt EUV, and Ford F-150 Lightning.

# Cost of Charging an EV  

The cost\* of charging an EV is less than half the cost of fueling an internal combustion vehicle when fuel cost is  

$\$3.75$ per gallon and electricity is $\$0.20$ per kWh, approximately Chugach's residential rate.  

Try Chugach's EV Calculator to compare the cost of charging an EV to the cost of fueling a gasoline vehicle. It also calculates carbon dioxide emissions reduction based on Chugach's generation mix of natural gas, hydro and wind.  

EV Fuel and Carbon Savings Calculator  

The Alaska Electric Vehicle Calculator developed by the Alaska Centerfor Energy and Power provides additional information on energy costs around Alaska and seasonal energy consumption.  

\*Assumes average electric vehicle efficiency of 2.9 miles per kWh and the average gasoline vehicle efciency of 26.0 miles per gallon.  

# EV Emissions  

The emissions from driving an EV are produced at the power plants where electricity is generated, rather than being emitted from the vehicle directly. Chugach has a generation portfolio comprised of natural gas, hydro, and wind. An electric vehicle powered by the Chugach system is responsible for approximately $66\%$ lesscarbon dioxide than an average-efficiency gasoline-powered passenger vehicle. In addition, an EV emits no cold-start carbon monoxide or other pollutants. Chugach members who have rooftop solar panels can further reduce the carbon emissions of driving an EV.  

# Charging Your Electric Vehicle  

EV charging can be flexible, cost-effective, and convenient. Planning for your charging needs when considering a new EV helps maximize the value and convenience of your charging experience. Your vehicle type, weekly mileage, schedule, and home electrical capacity can influence your charging solution.
