# HEEHRA Rebates  

HEEHRA rebates are funded by the federal Inflation Reduction Act, which is overseen by the U.S. Department of Energy and managed by the California Energy Commission (https:/www.energy.ca.gov/programs-andtopics/programs/inflation-reduction-act-residential-energy-rebate-programs) (CEC). HEEHRA rebates are only available through HEEHRA-trained, TECH Clean California-certified contractors. TECH Clean California contractors will provide project quotes, reserve incentive funds, perform installations, and guide you through the HEEHRA rebate process. Your rebate will be provided to you as either an instant discount on your invoice or as a reimbursement after the rebate has been processed. Your TECH Clean California contractor can also help identify other available incentives to help reduce the cost of your project.  

# Single Family HEEHRA Rebates  

$\$45$ million in statewide rebates is available now for heat pump equipment to heat and cool single family homes! Income-qualified California residents can receive a HEEHRA rebate of up to $\$8,000$ through TECH Clean California. Single family homes include buildings with four or less units (fourplexes, duplexes, singles), condos, and manufactured or mobile homes. To receive this rebate, you as a customermust:  

1. First, check if your income qualifies for a HEEHRA rebate by going to the HEEHRA Income Verification Portal at heehra-incomeportal.com (http://heehra-incomeportal.com). In the portal, you can quickly check if your household's annual income qualifies for a HEEHRA rebate by populating the "Check Income Guidelines" section with the county in which your home address resides and the number of people living in your home.  

· If your household income is at or below the maximum annual income listed in the "Maximum annual income - \$8000 Rebate" box, then you qualify for a HEEHRA rebate of up to $\$8,000$   
· If your household income is at or below the maximum annual income listed in the "Maximum annual income - $\$40000$ Rebate"box, then you qualify for a HEEHRA rebate of up to $\$4,000$   
· See below for equipment eligibility and other rebate details.  

1. If your household income appears to meet the pre-screening threshold, select a TECH Clean California-certified contractor trained in HEEHRA rebates. Find certified contractors at The Switch Is On's Contractor Finder (https://www.switchison.org/contractor-finder). 2. Once you have chosen a contractor, go back to the HEEHRA Income Verification Portal (https://heehra-incomeportal.com/) and set up an account then follow the steps to verify your income.  

The HEEHRA Income Verification Portal requires you to enter the email address of your contractor. We highly recommend finding a contractor before qualifying your income. If you do not have a contractor and wish to verify your income, you can enter in your owr email address for "contractor email address" and update it later. 3. After you complete the income verification application, you and your contractor willreceive an approval or denial notice via email (usually within three days). The approval notice will allow your contractor to start the HEEHRA rebate reservation process.  

At any point, you can also login to the HEEHRA Income Verification Portal (https://heehra-incomeportal.com/) and see the status of your application in your user profile. You will receive status updates via email as well.  

If you have income-verification questions, please request a call back by leaving a voicemail at 1-888-494-2532 (tel:1-888-494-2532).

# Are HEEHRA rebates allowed retroactively for work performed before the program launch?  

No. Equipment purchases, projects sold and/or installations completed before HEEHRA single family rebates became available on November 12 2024 are not eligible for rebates.  

Any person or business offering to submit a program application on your behalf or signs a contract guaranteeing a rebate before the program begins cannot provide rebates for you at this time and is not associated with TECH Clean California, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the State of California, the California Energy Commission (CEC), or the rebate program administrator. If you are concerned that you were lied to or scammed, we encourage you to contact the California Department of Consumer Affairs at www.dca.ca.gov (http://www.dca.ca.gov/) or call 1-800-952-5210, the Califonia Attorney General's Office at www.oag.ca.gov (http://www.oag.ca.gov/), the Better Business Bureau at www.bbb.org (http://www.bbb.org/) or your county's District Attorney's Office. Please copy our customer support team on these reports at TECH.info@energy-solution.com (mailto:TECH.info@energy-solution.com).  

# Are there other incentives or financing available to cover my project costs?  

A TECH Clean California contractor can help you identify other potential incentives and rebates. HEEHRA rebates may be layered with other TECH Clean California incentives, state, local utility, and equipment rebates, and grants, loans, and tax credits to help cover the cost of equipment and appliance purchases and installation. Available rebates and incentives can be found here (https://incentives.switchison.org/residents/incentives? State=CA).  

# How do I know if rebates are still available?  

We expect rebates to be reserved quickly. The $\$45$ million single family incentive budget is allocated to different regions across California and to different income types. Please see our Incentive Budget Report (https:/techcleanca.com/incentives/) to see reserved and non-reserved budgets for single family HEEHRA funds by region and incentive type. Only HEEHRA-trained, TECH Clean California-certified contractors can reserve rebates. Therefore, you must work with TECH Clean California-certified contractor and have your income verified to reserve a HEEHRA rebate.  

Contractors who want to be certified to provide TECH Clean California incentives and HEEHRA rebates can enroll here.
