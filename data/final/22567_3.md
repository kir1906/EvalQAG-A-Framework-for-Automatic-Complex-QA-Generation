# Weatherization Program  

# Explanation:  

Option $1-0\%$ Loan: Lane Electric members wanting to weatherize their home are eligible to apply for 0 percent interest loan up to $\$9,4000$ through Pacific Cascade Federal Credit Union. Interest buydowns are provided by Lane Electric to allow our members an affordable option to install efficiency measures. If you wish to apply for a loan, contact our Energy Services Department to request loan applications.  

(Property owners of rentals obtain loan funding under the program.)  

Option 2 – Cash Grant: Available funds cover 25 percent of the measure costs up to a maximum of $\$1000$ . Members are not obligated to reimburse Lane Electric for these funds.  

Incentives are available to single or multi-family residences provided some permanently installed electric heat exists in the dwelling.  Eligible measures include: vinyl window replacements, ceiling, floor, and wall insulation, HVAC duct sealing and repair, door and window caulking, weather-stripping, and general air sealing.  

# How It Works:  

The member must request an energy analysis for the dwelling. Requests are completed on a firstcome, first-served basis. After the energy analysis is performed, a packet including recommendations and a suggested contractor list will be mailed to the member. Next, please follow the easy steps on the checklist enclosed. The boxes provided at each step will allow you to chart your progress.  It is very important that all the Lane Electric forms be filled out and returned to our office.  Funds will not be allocated for your project unless all forms are returned to Lane Electric. Upon receipt of paperwork from the member, Lane Electric will send the credit application and chosen bid to the credit union. If the credit union approves the loan application, Lane Electric will contact the member within 48 hours with further instructions. At the time of approval, the member will notify the chosen contractor to proceed with the work.  

If you should choose the cash grant, Lane Electric will notify you of approval.  

Upon inspection and approval of installed measures, payment will be made to the contractor using approved loan funds or cash grants.

# PLEASE FOLLOW THIS CHECK LIST TO OUALIFY FOR OUR PROGRAM  

# Choose qualifying measures  

Decide which measures you want to install. In this packet, you will find a document entitled Recommendations. This sheet lists all measures eligible for incentives. Please note: Since our budget is limited, all funding is available on a first come – first serve basis.  

# Decide which funding option you wish to apply for  

Option 1 is our loan program. If you wish to apply for a loan, contact our Energy Services Department to request a loan application. Option 2 is a grant program. Both are described on the form entitled Weatherization Program.  

# Obtain bids and apply for project pre-approval  

Obtain at least two bids from state licensed contractors. The Lane Electric Weatherization Contractors List provides contact information for many qualifying area contractors. Return these bids along with the completed Notice of Bid Preference / Program Option and credit application from the Credit Union (for Option 1) to Lane Electric for review. The Credit Union will contact you if further information is needed to process your loan application. For Option 2, return the Notice of Bid Preference/Program Option and bids only. Be sure to indicate the contractor(s) you have selected to perform the work.  

If you elect to do the work yourself, contact the Energy Services Department and request further instructions. Return your bid and the Notice of Bid Preference / Program Option, entering “Do-it-yourself” under the contractor heading.  

# Project and Funding Approval  

LEC will review your project for eligibility. For loan approval (Option 1), Lane Electric will contact you within 48 hours of bank approval with further instructions. Direct fund approval (Option 2) will come from Lane Electric within 14 days. Please do not obligate yourself to a contractor or begin work yourself until you receive project authorization from Lane Electric.  

# Install Measures  

After project and funding approval, LEC will contact your selected contractor in writing to confirm funding and eligibility.  

# Inspection Request  

Once the work is complete, please contact the Energy Services Department at Lane Electric to schedule a final inspection.  

# Contractor Payment  

For Option 1, Pacific Cascade Federal Credit Union will release loan funds to the contractor after inspection and approval by Lane Electric. Under Option 2, grant funds through Lane Electric will be paid after the job passes final inspection.
