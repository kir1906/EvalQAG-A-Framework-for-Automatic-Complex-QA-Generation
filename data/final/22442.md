Sec. 801-5. Findings and declaration of policy. The General Assembly hereby finds, determines and declares:  

(a) that there are a number of existing State authorities authorized to issue bonds to alleviate the conditions and promote the objectives set forth below; and to provide a stronger, better coordinated development effort, it is determined to be in the interest of promoting the health, safety, morals and general welfare of all the people of the State to consolidate certain of such existing authorities into one finance authority;  

(b) that involuntary unemployment affects the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the people of the State of Illinois;  

(c) that the economic burdens resulting from involuntary unemployment fall in part upon the State in the form of public assistance and reduced tax revenues, and in the event the unemployed worker and his family migrate elsewhere to find work, may also fall upon the municipalities and other taxing districts within the areas of unemployment in the form of reduced tax revenues, thereby endangering their financial ability to support necessary governmental services for their remaining inhabitants;  

(d) that a vigorous growing economy is the basic source of job opportunities;  

(e) that protection against involuntary unemployment, its economic burdens and the spread of economic stagnation can best be provided by promoting, attracting, stimulating and revitalizing industry, manufacturing and commerce in the State;  

(f) that the State has a responsibility to help create a favorable climate for new and improved job opportunities for its citizens by encouraging the development of commercial businesses and industrial and manufacturing plants within the State;  

(g) that increased availability of funds for construction of new facilities and the expansion and improvement of existing facilities for industrial, commercial and manufacturing facilities will provide for new and continued employment in the construction industry and alleviate the burden of unemployment;  

(h) that in the absence of direct governmental subsidies the unaided operations of private enterprise do not provide sufficient resources for residential construction, rehabilitation, rental or purchase, and that support from housing related commercial facilities is one means of stimulating residential construction, rehabilitation, rental and purchase;  

(i) that it is in the public interest and the policy of this State to foster and promote by all reasonable means the provision of adequate capital markets and facilities for borrowing money by units of local government, and for the financing of their respective public improvements and other governmental purposes within the State from proceeds of bonds or notes issued by those governmental units; and to assist local governmental units in fulfilling their needs for those purposes by use of creation of indebtedness;  

(j) that it is in the public interest and the policy of this State to the extent possible, to reduce the costs of indebtedness to taxpayers and residents of this State and to encourage continued investor interest in the purchase of bonds or notes of governmental units as sound and preferred securities for investment; and to encourage governmental units to continue their independent undertakings of public improvements and other governmental purposes and the financing thereof, and to assist them in those activities by making funds available at reduced interest costs for orderly financing of those purposes, especially during periods of restricted credit or money supply, and particularly for those governmental units not otherwise able to borrow for those purposes;  

(k) that in this State the following conditions exist: (i) an inadequate supply of funds at interest rates sufficiently low to enable persons engaged in agriculture in this State to pursue agricultural operations at present levels; (ii) that such inability to pursue agricultural operations lessens the supply of agricultural commodities available to fulfill the needs of the citizens of this State; (iii) that such inability to continue operations decreases available employment in the agricultural sector of the State and results in unemployment and its attendant problems; (iv) that such conditions prevent the acquisition of an adequate capital stock of farm equipment and machinery, much of which is manufactured in this State, therefore impairing the productivity of agricultural land and, further, causing unemployment or lack of appropriate increase in employment in such manufacturing; (v) that such conditions are conducive to consolidation of acreage of agricultural land with fewer individuals living and farming on the traditional family farm; (vi) that these conditions result in a loss in population, unemployment and movement of persons from rural to urban areas accompanied by added costs to communities for creation of new public facilities and services; (vii) that there have been recurrent shortages of funds for agricultural purposes from private market sources at reasonable rates of interest; (viii) that these shortages have made the sale and purchase of agricultural land to family farmers a virtual impossibility in many parts of the State; (ix) that the ordinary operations of private enterprise have not in the past corrected these conditions; and (x) that a stable supply of adequate funds for agricultural financing is required to encourage family farmers in an orderly and sustained manner and to reduce the problems described above;  

(l) that for the benefit of the people of the State of  

Illinois, the conduct and increase of their commerce, the protection and enhancement of their welfare, the development of continued prosperity and the improvement of their health and living conditions it is essential that all the people of the State be given the fullest opportunity to learn and to develop their intellectual and mental capacities and skills; that to achieve these ends it is of the utmost importance that private institutions of higher education within the State be provided with appropriate additional means to assist the people of the State in achieving the required levels of learning and development of their intellectual and mental capacities and skills and that cultural institutions within the State be provided with appropriate additional means to expand the services and resources which they offer for the cultural, intellectual, scientific, educational and artistic enrichment of the people of the State;  

(m) that in order to foster civic and neighborhood pride, citizens require access to facilities such as educational institutions, recreation, parks and open spaces, entertainment and sports, a reliable transportation network, cultural facilities and theaters and other facilities as authorized by this Act, and that it is in the best interests of the State to lower the costs of all such facilities by providing financing through the State;  

(n) that to preserve and protect the health of the citizens of the State, and lower the costs of health care, that financing for health facilities should be provided through the State; and it is hereby declared to be the policy of the State, in the interest of promoting the health, safety, morals and general welfare of all the people of the State, to address the conditions noted above, to increase job opportunities and to retain existing jobs in the State, by making available through the Illinois Finance Authority, hereinafter created, funds for the development, improvement and creation of industrial, housing, local government, educational, health, public purpose and other projects; to issue its bonds and notes to make funds at reduced rates and on more favorable terms for borrowing by local governmental units through the purchase of the bonds or notes of the governmental units; and to make or acquire loans for the acquisition and development of agricultural facilities; to provide financing for private institutions of higher education, cultural institutions, health facilities and other facilities and projects as authorized by this Act; and to grant broad powers to the Illinois Finance Authority to accomplish and to carry out these policies of the State which are in the public interest of the State and of its taxpayers and residents;  

(o) that providing financing alternatives for projects that are located outside the State that are owned, operated, leased, managed by, or otherwise affiliated with, institutions located within the State would promote the economy of the State for the benefit of the health, welfare, safety, trade, commerce, industry, and economy of the people of the State by creating employment opportunities in the State and lowering the cost of accessing healthcare, private education, or cultural institutions in the State by reducing the cost of financing or operating those projects; and  

(p) that the realization of the objectives of the   
Authority identified in this Act including, without   
limitation, those designed (1) to assist and enable veterans,   
minorities, women and disabled individuals to own and operate   
small businesses; (2) to assist in the delivery of   
agricultural assistance; and (3) to aid, assist, and encourage   
economic growth and development within this State, will be   
enhanced by empowering the Authority to purchase loan   
participations from participating lenders;. (q) that climate change threatens the health, welfare, and   
prosperity of all the residents of the State; (r) combating climate change is necessary to preserve and   
enhance the health, welfare, and prosperity of all the   
residents of the State; (s) that the promotion of the development and

change and is hereby declared to be the policy of the State;

Pending the preparation and execution of any such bonds, temporary bonds may be issued as provided by the resolution. The bonds shall be sold by the Authority in such manner as it shall determine. The bonds may be secured as provided in the authorizing resolution by the receipts, revenues, income and other available funds of the Authority and by any amounts derived by the Authority from the loan agreement or lease agreement with respect to the project or projects; and bonds may be issued as general obligations of the Authority payable from such revenues, funds and obligations of the Authority as the bond resolution shall provide, or may be issued as limited obligations with a claim for payment solely from such revenues, funds and obligations as the bond resolution shall provide. The Authority may grant a specific pledge or assignment of and lien on or security interest in such rights, revenues, income, or amounts and may grant a specific pledge or assignment of and lien on or security interest in any reserves, funds or accounts established in the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds. Any such pledge, assignment, lien or security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Authority's bonds shall be valid and binding from the time the bonds are issued without any physical delivery or further act, and shall be valid and binding as against and prior to the claims of all other parties having claims against the Authority or any other person irrespective of whether the other parties have notice of the pledge, assignment, lien or security interest. As evidence of such pledge, assignment, lien and security interest, the Authority may execute and deliver a mortgage, trust agreement, indenture or security agreement or an assignment thereof. A remedy for any breach or default of the terms of any such agreement by the Authority may be by mandamus proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel the performance and compliance therewith, but the agreement may prescribe by whom or on whose behalf such action may be instituted. It is expressly understood that the Authority may, but need not, acquire title to any project with respect to which it exercises its authority.  

(d) With respect to the powers granted by this Act, the  

Authority may adopt rules and regulations prescribing the procedures by which persons may apply for assistance under this Act. Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude the Authority, prior to the filing of any formal application, from conducting preliminary discussions and investigations with respect to the subject matter of any prospective application.  

(e) The Authority shall have power to acquire by purchase, lease, gift or otherwise any property or rights therein from any person useful for its purposes, whether improved for the purposes of any prospective project, or unimproved. The Authority may also accept any donation of funds for its purposes from any such source. The Authority shall have no independent power of condemnation but may acquire any property or rights therein obtained upon condemnation by any other authority, governmental entity or unit of local government with such power.  

(f) The Authority shall have power to develop, construct and improve either under its own direction, or through collaboration with any approved applicant, or to acquire through purchase or otherwise, any project, using for such purpose the proceeds derived from the sale of its bonds or from governmental loans or grants, and to hold title in the name of the Authority to such projects.  

(g) The Authority shall have power to lease pursuant to a lease agreement any project so developed and constructed or acquired to the approved tenant on such terms and conditions as may be appropriate to further the purposes of this Act and to maintain the credit of the Authority. Any such lease may provide for either the Authority or the approved tenant to assume initially, in whole or in part, the costs of maintenance, repair and improvements during the leasehold period. In no case, however, shall the total rentals from any project during any initial leasehold period or the total loan repayments to be made pursuant to any loan agreement, be less than an amount necessary to return over such lease or loan period (1) all costs incurred in connection with the development, construction, acquisition or improvement of the project and for repair, maintenance and improvements thereto during the period of the lease or loan; provided, however, that the rentals or loan repayments need not include costs met through the use of funds other than those obtained by the Authority through the issuance of its bonds or governmental loans; (2) a reasonable percentage additive to be agreed upon by the Authority and the borrower or tenant to cover a properly allocable portion of the Authority's general expenses, including, but not limited to, administrative expenses, salaries and general insurance, and (3) an amount sufficient to pay when due all principal of, interest and premium, if any on, any bonds issued by the Authority with respect to the project. The portion of total rentals payable under clause (3) of this subsection (g) shall be deposited in such special accounts, including all sinking funds, acquisition or construction funds, debt service and other funds as provided by any resolution, mortgage or trust agreement of the Authority pursuant to which any bond is issued.  

(h) The Authority has the power, upon the termination of any leasehold period of any project, to sell or lease for a further term or terms such project on such terms and conditions as the Authority shall deem reasonable and consistent with the purposes of the Act. The net proceeds from all such sales and the revenues or income from such leases shall be used to satisfy any indebtedness of the Authority with respect to such project and any balance may be used to pay any expenses of the Authority or be used for the further development, construction, acquisition or improvement of projects. In the event any project is vacated by a tenant prior to the termination of the initial leasehold period, the Authority shall sell or lease the facilities of the project on the most advantageous terms available. The net proceeds of any such disposition shall be treated in the same manner as the proceeds from sales or the revenues or income from leases subsequent to the termination of any initial leasehold period.  

(i) The Authority shall have the power to make loans, or to purchase loan participations in loans made, to persons to finance a project, to enter into loan agreements or agreements with participating lenders with respect thereto, and to accept guarantees from persons of its loans or the resultant evidences of obligations of the Authority.  

(j) The Authority may fix, determine, charge and collect any premiums, fees, charges, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, any application fees, commitment fees, program fees, financing charges or publication fees from any person in connection with its activities under this Act.  

(k) In addition to the funds established as provided herein, the Authority shall have the power to create and establish such reserve funds and accounts as may be necessary or desirable to accomplish its purposes under this Act and to deposit its available monies into the funds and accounts.  

(l) At the request of the governing body of any unit of local government, the Authority is authorized to market such local government's revenue bond offerings by preparing bond issues for sale, advertising for sealed bids, receiving bids at its offices, making the award to the bidder that offers the most favorable terms or arranging for negotiated placements or underwritings of such securities. The Authority may, at its discretion, offer for concurrent sale the revenue bonds of several local governments. Sales by the Authority of revenue bonds under this Section shall in no way imply State guarantee of such debt issue. The Authority may require such financial information from participating local governments as it deems necessary in order to carry out the purposes of this subsection (1).  

(m) The Authority may make grants to any county to which Division 5-37 of the Counties Code is applicable to assist in the financing of capital development, construction and renovation of new or existing facilities for hospitals and health care facilities under that Act. Such grants may only be made from funds appropriated for such purposes from the Build Illinois Bond Fund.  

(n) The Authority may establish an urban development action grant program for the purpose of assisting municipalities in Illinois which are experiencing severe economic distress to help stimulate economic development activities needed to aid in economic recovery. The Authority shall determine the types of activities and projects for which the urban development action grants may be used, provided that such projects and activities are broadly defined to include all reasonable projects and activities the primary objectives of which are the development of viable urban communities, including decent housing and a suitable living environment, and expansion of economic opportunity, principally for persons of low and moderate incomes. The Authority shall enter into grant agreements from monies appropriated for such purposes from the Build Illinois Bond Fund. The Authority shall monitor the use of the grants, and shall provide for audits of the funds as well as recovery by the Authority of any funds determined to have been spent in violation of this subsection (n) or any rule or regulation promulgated hereunder. The Authority shall provide technical assistance with regard to the effective use of the urban development action grants. The  

Authority shall file an annual report to the General Assembly concerning the progress of the grant program.  

(o) The Authority may establish a Housing Partnership Program whereby the Authority provides zero-interest loans to municipalities for the purpose of assisting in the financing of projects for the rehabilitation of affordable multi-family housing for low and moderate income residents. The Authority may provide such loans only upon a municipality's providing evidence that it has obtained private funding for the rehabilitation project. The Authority shall provide 3 State dollars for every 7 dollars obtained by the municipality from sources other than the State of Illinois. The loans shall be made from monies appropriated for such purpose from the Build Illinois Bond Fund. The total amount of loans available under the Housing Partnership Program shall not exceed \$30,000,000. State loan monies under this subsection shall be used only for the acquisition and rehabilitation of existing buildings containing 4 or more dwelling units. The terms of any loan made by the municipality under this subsection shall require repayment of the loan to the municipality upon any sale or other transfer of the project. In addition, the Authority may use any moneys appropriated for such purpose from the Build Illinois Bond Fund, including funds loaned under this subsection and repaid as principal or interest, and investment income on such funds, to make the loans authorized by subsection (z), without regard to any restrictions or limitations provided in this subsection.  

(p) The Authority may award grants to universities and research institutions, research consortiums and other not-for-profit entities for the purposes of: remodeling or otherwise physically altering existing laboratory or research facilities, expansion or physical additions to existing laboratory or research facilities, construction of new laboratory or research facilities or acquisition of modern equipment to support laboratory or research operations provided that such grants (i) be used solely in support of project and equipment acquisitions which enhance technology transfer, and (ii) not constitute more than 60 percent of the total project or acquisition cost.  

(q) Grants may be awarded by the Authority to units of local government for the purpose of developing the appropriate infrastructure or defraying other costs to the local government in support of laboratory or research facilities provided that such grants may not exceed $40\%$ of the cost to the unit of local government.  

(r) In addition to the powers granted to the Authority under subsection (i), and in all cases supplemental to it, the Authority may establish a direct loan program to make loans to, or may purchase participations in loans made by participating lenders to, individuals, partnerships, corporations, or other business entities for the purpose of financing an industrial project, as defined in Section 801-10 of this Act. For the purposes of such program and not by way of limitation on any other program of the Authority, including, without limitation, programs established under subsection (i), the Authority shall have the power to issue bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness including commercial paper for purposes of providing a fund of capital from which it may make such loans. The Authority shall have the power to use any appropriations from the State made especially for the Authority's direct loan program, or moneys at any time held by the Authority under this Act outside the State treasury in the custody of either the Treasurer of the Authority or a trustee or depository appointed by the Authority, for additional capital to make such loans or purchase such loan participations, or for the purposes of reserve funds or pledged funds which secure the Authority's obligations of repayment of any bond, note or other form of indebtedness established for the purpose of providing capital for which it intends to make such loans or purchase such loan participations. For the purpose of obtaining such capital, the Authority may also enter into agreements with financial institutions, participating lenders, and other persons for the purpose of administering a loan participation program, selling loans or developing a secondary market for such loans or loan participations. Loans made under the direct loan program specifically established under this subsection (r), including loans under such program made by participating lenders in which the Authority purchases a participation, may be in an amount not to exceed $\$600$ ,000 and shall be made for a portion of an industrial project which does not exceed $50\%$ of the total project. No loan may be made by the Authority unless approved by the affirmative vote of at least 8 members of the board. The Authority shall establish procedures and publish rules which shall provide for the submission, review, and analysis of each direct loan and loan participation application and which shall preserve the ability of each board member and the Executive Director, as applicable, to reach an individual business judgment regarding the propriety of each direct loan or loan participation. The collective discretion of the board to approve or disapprove each loan shall be unencumbered. The Authority may establish and collect such fees and charges, determine and enforce such terms and conditions, and charge such interest rates as it determines to be necessary and appropriate to the successful administration of the direct loan program, including purchasing loan participations. The Authority may require such interests in collateral and such guarantees as it determines are necessary to protect the Authority's interest in the repayment of the principal and interest of each loan and loan participation made under the direct loan program. The restrictions established under this subsection (r) shall not be applicable to any loan or loan participation made under subsection (i) or to any loan or loan participation made under any other Section of this Act.  

(s) The Authority may guarantee private loans to third parties up to a specified dollar amount in order to promote economic development in this State.  

(t) The Authority may adopt rules and regulations as may be necessary or advisable to implement the powers conferred by this Act.  

(u) The Authority shall have the power to issue bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, which may be used to make loans to units of local government which are authorized to enter into loan agreements and other documents and to issue bonds, notes and other evidences of indebtedness for the purpose of financing the protection of storm sewer outfalls, the construction of adequate storm sewer outfalls, and the provision for flood protection of sanitary sewage treatment plans, in counties that have established a stormwater management planning committee in accordance with Section 5-1062 of the Counties Code. Any such loan shall be made by the Authority pursuant to the provisions of Section 820-5 to 820-60 of this Act. The unit of local government shall pay back to the Authority the principal amount of the loan, plus annual interest as determined by the Authority. The Authority shall have the power, subject to appropriations by the General Assembly, to subsidize or buy down a portion of the interest on such loans, up to $4\%$ per annum.  

(v) The Authority may accept security interests as provided in Sections 11-3 and 11-3.3 of the Illinois Public  

Aid Code.  

(w) Moral Obligation. In the event that the Authority determines that monies of the Authority will not be sufficient for the payment of the principal of and interest on its bonds during the next State fiscal year, the Chairperson, as soon as practicable, shall certify to the Governor the amount required by the Authority to enable it to pay such principal of and interest on the bonds. The Governor shall submit the amount so certified to the General Assembly as soon as practicable, but no later than the end of the current State fiscal year. This subsection shall apply only to any bonds or notes as to which the Authority shall have determined, in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or notes, that this subsection shall apply. Whenever the Authority makes such a determination, that fact shall be plainly stated on the face of the bonds or notes and that fact shall also be reported to the Governor. In the event of a withdrawal of moneys from a reserve fund established with respect to any issue or issues of bonds of the Authority to pay principal or interest on those bonds, the Chairperson of the Authority, as soon as practicable, shall certify to the Governor the amount required to restore the reserve fund to the level required in the resolution or indenture securing those bonds.

Article 10. Energy Community Reinvestment Act  

Section 10-1. Short title. This Article may be cited as the Energy Community Reinvestment Act. References in this Article to "this Act" mean this Article.  

Section 10-5. Findings. The General Assembly finds that, as part of putting Illinois on a path to $100\%$ renewable energy, the State of Illinois should ensure a just transition to that goal, providing support for the transition of Illinois' communities and workers impacted by closures or reduced use of fossil fuel power plants, nuclear power plants, or coal mines by allocating new economic development resources for business tax incentives, workforce training, site clean-up and reuse, and local tax revenue replacement.  

The General Assembly finds and declares that the health, safety, and welfare of the people of this State are dependent upon a healthy economy and vibrant communities; that the closure of fossil fuel power plants, nuclear power plants, and coal mines across this State have a significant impact on their surrounding communities; that the expansion of renewable energy creates job growth and contributes to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of this State; that the continual encouragement, development, growth, and expansion of renewable energy within this State requires a cooperative and continuous partnership between government and the renewable energy sector; and that there are certain areas in this State that have lost, or will lose, jobs due to the closure of fossil fuel power plants, nuclear power plants, and coal mines and need the particular attention of government, labor, and the residents of Illinois to help attract new investment into these areas and directly aid the local community and its residents.  

Therefore, it is declared to be the purpose of this Act to explore ways of stimulating the growth of new private investment, including renewable energy investment, in this State and to foster job growth in areas impacted by the closure of coal energy plants, coal mines, and nuclear energy plants.

Section 20-90. Repealer. This Act is repealed 24 years after the effective date of this Act.  

Section 90-1. Legislative findings. The General Assembly finds and declares:  

(1) The overall objectives of regulation of the electric utility industry in this State, as expressed by the General Assembly in the Illinois Power Agency Act and the Public Utilities Act, include the provision of adequate, efficient, reliable, environmentally safe, and least-cost utility services at prices that accurately reflect the long-term cost of such services and that are equitable to all citizens.  

(2) For many years, a significant portion of the electricity consumed by consumers and businesses in this State, particularly in the downstate region, has been produced by large coal-fueled electric generating stations located in the downstate region. However, in recent years, the prices for electric generating capacity and energy available to coal-fueled electric generating stations located in the downstate region of this State have been insufficient to enable many electric generating facilities located within the downstate region to remain in operation, and have placed other electric generating stations at risk of closure. Changes in environmental regulations and, significantly, increasing concerns about the effects of carbon emissions on the climate, have also contributed to the retirement of coal-fueled generating stations in the downstate region. As a result, the vast majority of the coal-fueled generation located in Illinois, and particularly in the downstate region, has recently been retired or will be retired by no later than the end of 2027.  

(3) Reliable electric service at all times is essential to the functioning of a modern economy and of society in general. The health, welfare, and prosperity of Illinois citizens, including the attractiveness of the State of Illinois to business and industry, requires the availability of sufficient electric generating capacity, including energy storage capacity, to meet the demands of consumers and businesses in this State at all times. However, to a significant extent, electricity, when generated, cannot be stored for future use in any significant amount relative to the total amount of electricity that existing generating facilities can produce. Rather, for the most part, electricity must be produced instantaneously at the time and in the amount that it is demanded by residential and business consumers.  

The development of energy storage facilities provides some opportunity to store some amounts of electricity for use at later times; but energy storage facilities with sufficient capacity to deliver electricity to meet the demands of consumers in this State, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week on every day of the year, have not yet been built.  

(4) Both the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc., which is the independent transmission system operator for downstate Illinois, and its Independent Market Monitor, have expressed concerns about the sufficiency of electric generating resources in downstate Illinois over the next several years, due primarily to the announced and anticipated retirements of coal-fueled electric generating facilities and concerns about how quickly and extensively new wind and solar generating facilities will be placed into service. Concerns have also been expressed, based on the intermittent nature of wind and solar generating facilities, as to whether the grid can operate reliably without sufficient dispatchable generation resources or significant additions of energy storage facilities to balance the output of renewable generating facilities. The General Assembly believes that the State cannot afford to find itself in a situation of insufficient electric generating resources to meet the needs of Illinois residential and business consumers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Thus, consistent with the overall objectives of the regulation of the electric utility industry in this State and the interests of the State in protecting the health and welfare of its residents, regulation should ensure that sufficient generating resources, including energy storage resources, are available to enable the electric utility grid to meet the demands of Illinois electricity consumers at all times.  

(5) Through previous enactments beginning in 2007, the General Assembly has provided financial incentives for the construction and operation of wind, solar, and other types of renewable energy facilities to serve load in Illinois. In such enactments, the General Assembly has recognized that providing opportunities to enter into long-term contracts for the purchase of renewable energy credits from renewable energy facilities creates incentives, and in fact is necessary, for the construction and operation of such resources. Developers typically cannot, financially, develop new, large-scale renewable energy generating resources without having secured long-term contracts for the renewable energy credits that the new facilities will produce.  

(6) The permitting and siting of new wind and solar generating facilities in Illinois are subject to local governmental control, and in many areas of this State, there has been strong opposition to the siting and construction of new utility-scale wind and solar generating facilities, which in turn has resulted in the denial of, or withdrawal of requests for, necessary approvals for some projects and the enactment of local zoning ordinances imposing requirements and restrictions that increase the costs and reduce the economic attractiveness of such projects. This has resulted in delay or cancellation of a number of renewable energy projects. This experience demonstrates the advantages of targeting the installation of new utility-scale renewable energy facilities at sites that are already suitable for installation of such facilities and can be readily permitted.  

(7) In light of the intermittent nature of many types of renewable energy facilities, such as wind and solar generation, the installation and operation of electricity storage facilities in conjunction with the installation and operation of renewable generation facilities can enhance the value of renewable energy resources to the electric grid.  

(8) The sites of many of the large coal-fueled electric generating stations located in the downstate region of this State that have recently been retired or announced for retirement, or are at risk of retirement, have existing infrastructure and other characteristics which make them suitable potential sites for development of new renewable energy generating facilities and electricity storage facilities. This infrastructure and other characteristics include large amounts of available land situated at a suitable distance from populated areas, suitable levels of exposure to sunlight, and high voltage interconnections to nearby bulk electric system transmission grid facilities at strategic locations. Development of these generating plant sites for large-scale renewable energy generating facilities, particularly photovoltaic facilities which require large amounts of space, and electricity storage facilities, can help advance this State's objective of increasing the portion of the State's total electricity usage that is supplied by zero emission resources, and reducing the proportion of the electricity produced in this State that is produced by carbon-emitting resources, while supporting the reliability of electric service in the downstate region. Accordingly, the General Assembly finds that it is in the public interest to encourage the redevelopment of the sites of retired and still-operating coal-fueled electric generating stations as locations for renewable energy generating facilities and electricity storage facilities.  

(9) Many, if not all, of the coal-fueled electric generating plants in this State that have recently been retired or announced for retirement, or are at near-term risk of retirement, were at one time owned, at whole or in part, by a public utility as defined in Section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act and were thereby devoted to public service and the public use in Illinois, with their costs paid for by rates paid by public utility ratepayers in Illinois. The General Assembly finds that it is appropriate to provide incentives to the owners of the sites of coal-fueled electric generating facilities in this State that were once owned by public utilities, to repurpose those sites in a manner that continues to benefit the public by providing for the generation of carbon-free, non-emitting electricity and reliable bulk electric service.  

(10) The General Assembly finds it is appropriate for the State of Illinois to establish a program to provide incentives for the installation and operation of new renewable energy facilities, along with energy storage facilities, at the sites of retired and at-risk coal-fueled electric generating facilities in this State, to help expedite the transition of this State's electric generation fleet to lower-emitting resources while ensuring the availability of sufficient electric energy resources to meet the demands of residential and business electricity consumers in this State.  

(11) In light of the foregoing findings, the purpose of the program established in subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act is to incentivize and support conversion and development of unused (or to be unused) sites of recently retired and soon to-be-retired coal-fueled power plants in this State to productive new uses as sites for the generation and provision of electricity from renewable energy facilities and energy storage facilities, thereby contributing to the State's efforts to reduce carbon emissions from facilities in this State and increase the production of the State's electricity needs from clean energy resources. The provisions of this Act also will support the reliability of the bulk power grid in this State by incentivizing and supporting installation of new generating facilities and energy storage facilities at locations on the grid where synchronous generation was formerly located.  

Section 90-3. The Illinois Administrative Procedure Act is amended by adding 5-45.9 as follows:  

# (5 ILCS 100/5-45.9 new)  

Sec. 5-45.9. Emergency rulemaking; Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plans. To provide for the expeditious and timely implementation of Section 16-105.17 of the Public Utilities Act, emergency rules implementing Section 16-105.17 of the Public Utilities Act may be adopted in accordance with Section  

5-45 by the Illinois Commerce Commission. The adoption of emergency rules authorized by Section 5-45 and this Section is deemed to be necessary for the public interest, safety, and welfare.  

This Section is repealed one year after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly.  

Section 90-5. The Illinois Governmental Ethics Act is amended by adding Section 1-121 and by changing Sections 4A-102 and 4A-103 as follows:

The report shall be used by the Commission to inform and evaluate the cost effectiveness and achievement of goals within the submitted Beneficial Electrification Plans. (d) No later than July 1, 2022, electric utilities serving greater than 500,000 customers in the State shall file a Beneficial Electrification Plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission for programs that start no later than January 1, 2023. The plan shall take into consideration recommendations from the workshop report described in this Section. Within 45 days after the filing of the Beneficial Electrification Plan, the Commission shall, with reasonable notice, open an investigation to consider whether the plan meets the objectives and contains the information required by this Section. The Commission shall determine if the proposed plan is cost-beneficial and in the public interest. When  

considering if the plan is in the public interest and determining appropriate levels of cost recovery for investments and expenditures related to programs proposed by an electric utility, the Commission shall consider whether the investments and other expenditures are designed and reasonably expected to:  

(1) maximize total energy cost savings and rate reductions so that nonparticipants can benefit; (2) address environmental justice interests by ensuring there are significant opportunities for residents and businesses in eligible communities to directly participate in and benefit from beneficial electrification programs;  

(3) support at least a 40% investment of make-ready infrastructure incentives to facilitate the rapid deployment of charging equipment in or serving environmental justice, low-income, and eligible communities; however, nothing in this subsection is intended to require a specific amount of spending in a particular geographic area;  

(4) support at least a 5% investment target in electrifying medium-duty and heavy-duty school bus and diesel public transportation vehicles located in or serving environmental justice, low-income, and eligible communities in order to provide those communities and businesses with greater economic investment, transportation opportunities, and a cleaner environment so they can directly benefit from transportation electrification efforts; however, nothing in this subsection is intended to require a specific amount of spending in a particular geographic area;  

(5) stimulate innovation, competition, private investment, and increased consumer choices in electric vehicle charging equipment and networks;  

(6) contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions and meeting air quality standards, including improving air quality in eligible communities who disproportionately suffer from emissions from the medium-duty and heavy-duty transportation sector;  

(7) support the efficient and cost-effective use of the electric grid in a manner that supports electric vehicle charging operations; and  

(8) provide resources to support private investment in charging equipment for uses in public and private charging applications, including residential, multi-family, fleet, transit, community, and corridor applications.  

The plan shall be determined to be cost-beneficial if the total cost of beneficial electrification expenditures is less than the net present value of increased electricity costs (defined as marginal avoided energy, avoided capacity, and avoided transmission and distribution system costs) avoided by programs under the plan, the net present value of reductions in other customer energy costs, net revenue from all electric charging in the service territory, and the societal value of reduced carbon emissions and surface-level pollutants, particularly in environmental justice communities. The calculation of costs and benefits should be based on net impacts, including the impact on customer rates.  

The Commission shall approve, approve with modifications, or reject the plan within 270 days from the date of filing. The Commission may approve the plan if it finds that the plan will achieve the goals described in this Section and contains the information described in this Section. Proceedings under this Section shall proceed according to the rules provided by Article IX of the Public Utilities Act. Information contained in the approved plan shall be considered part of the record in any Commission proceeding under Section 16-107.6 of the Public Utilities Act, provided that a final order has not been entered prior to the initial filing date. The Beneficial Electrification Plan shall specifically address, at a minimum, the following:  

(i) make-ready investments to facilitate the rapid deployment of charging equipment throughout the State, facilitate the electrification of public transit and other vehicle fleets in the light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty sectors, and align with Agency-issued rebates for charging equipment;  

(ii) the development and implementation of beneficial electrification programs, including time-of-use rates and their benefit for electric vehicle users and for all customers, optimized charging programs to achieve savings identified, and new contracts and compensation for services in those programs, through signals that allow electric vehicle charging to respond to local system conditions, manage critical peak periods, serve as a demand response or peak resource, and maximize renewable energy use and integration into the grid;  

(iii) optional commercial tariffs utilizing alternatives to traditional demand-based rate structures to facilitate charging for light duty, heavy duty, and fleet electric vehicles;  

(iv) financial and other challenges to electric vehicle usage in low-income communities, and strategies for overcoming those challenges, particularly in communities and for people for whom car ownership is not an option;  

(v) methods of minimizing ratepayer impacts and   
exempting or minimizing, to the extent possible,   
low-income ratepayers from the costs associated with   
facilitating the expansion of electric vehicle charging; (vi) plans to increase access to Level 3 Public   
Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure to serve vehicles   
that need quicker charging times and vehicles of persons   
who have no other access to charging infrastructure,  

regardless of whether those projects participate in optimized charging programs;  

(vii) whether to establish charging standards for type of plugs eligible for investment or incentive programs, and if so, what standards;  

(viii) opportunities for coordination and cohesion with electric vehicle and electric vehicle charging equipment incentives established by any agency, department, board, or commission of the State, any other unit of government in the State, any national programs, or any unit of the federal government;

Prevailing Wage Act. Therefore, the Department of Labor shall develop and administer a statewide program to assist small clean energy contractors in administering and complying with the Prevailing Wage Act requirements. This Program shall provide training and ongoing technical assistance pertaining to compliance with the Prevailing Wage Act, including certified payroll reporting requirements. Ongoing assistance shall include, but is not limited to, answering contractor questions, recommending tools and process improvements, establishing an account with and utilizing the Certified Transcript of Payroll Portal, building administrative expertise within individual businesses, and any other assistance businesses identify as needed based on verbal or other input. All Program training, technical assistance, materials, services, and systems shall be structured to accommodate and address real-world circumstances encountered by small clean energy contractors; shall be developed, refined, and adjusted as necessary in consultation with such contractors; and shall be administered to serve businesses that operate in languages other than English and do so at a level of service equivalent to that offered to businesses that operate in English. The Department may enter into agreements with entities with experience in supporting small businesses in underserved or historically disinvested communities to implement portions or all of the program, ensuring such capacity is developed in northern, central, and southern  

Illinois regions. The Department shall communicate and market program services to small clean energy contractors statewide, and may do so in coordination with the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity.

Section 90-30. The Illinois Power Agency Act is amended by changing Sections 1-5, 1-10, 1-20, 1-35, 1-56, 1-70, 1-75,  

1-92, and 1-125 and by adding Section 1-128 as follows:  

(20 ILCS 3855/1-5)  

Sec. 1-5. Legislative declarations and findings. The General Assembly finds and declares:  

(1) The health, welfare, and prosperity of all Illinois residents citizens require the provision of adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and environmentally sustainable electric service at the lowest total cost over time, taking into account any benefits of price stability.  

(1.5) To provide the highest quality of life for the residents of Illinois and to provide for a clean and healthy environment, it is the policy of this State to rapidly transition to 100% clean energy by 2050.  

(2) (Blank).  

(3) (Blank).  

(4) It is necessary to improve the process of procuring electricity to serve Illinois residents, to promote investment in energy efficiency and demand-response measures, and to maintain and support development of clean coal technologies, generation resources that operate at all hours of the day and under all weather conditions, zero emission facilities, and renewable resources.  

(5) Procuring a diverse electricity supply portfolio will ensure the lowest total cost over time for adequate, reliable, efficient, and environmentally sustainable electric service.  

(6) Including renewable resources and zero emission credits from zero emission facilities in that portfolio will reduce long-term direct and indirect costs to consumers by decreasing environmental impacts and by avoiding or delaying the need for new generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. Developing new renewable energy resources in Illinois, including brownfield solar projects and community solar projects, will help to diversify Illinois electricity supply, avoid and reduce pollution, reduce peak demand, and enhance public health and well-being of Illinois residents.  

(7) Developing community solar projects in Illinois will help to expand access to renewable energy resources to more Illinois residents.  

(8) Developing brownfield solar projects in Illinois will help return blighted or contaminated land to productive use while enhancing public health and the well-being of Illinois residents, including those in environmental justice communities.  

(9) Energy efficiency, demand-response measures, zero emission energy, and renewable energy are resources currently underused in Illinois. These resources should be used, when cost effective, to reduce costs to consumers, improve reliability, and improve environmental quality and public health.  

(10) The State should encourage the use of advanced clean coal technologies that capture and sequester carbon dioxide emissions to advance environmental protection goals and to demonstrate the viability of coal and coal-derived fuels in a carbon-constrained economy.  

(10.5) The State should encourage the development of interregional high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines that benefit Illinois. All ratepayers in the State served by the regional transmission organization where the HVDC converter station is interconnected benefit from the long-term price stability and market access provided by interregional HVDC transmission facilities. The benefits to Illinois include: reduction in wholesale power prices; access to lower-cost markets; enabling the integration of additional renewable generating units within the State through near instantaneous dispatchability and the provision of ancillary services; creating good-paying union jobs in Illinois; and, enhancing grid reliability and climate resilience via HVDC facilities that are installed underground.  

(10.6) The health, welfare, and safety of the people of the State are advanced by developing new HVDC transmission lines predominantly along transportation rights-of-way, with an HVDC converter station that is located in the service territory of a public utility as defined in Section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act serving more than 3,000,000 retail customers, and with a project labor agreement as defined in Section 1-10 of this Act.  

(11) The General Assembly enacted Public Act 96-0795 to reform the State's purchasing processes, recognizing that government procurement is susceptible to abuse if structural and procedural safeguards are not in place to ensure independence, insulation, oversight, and transparency.  

(12) The principles that underlie the procurement reform legislation apply also in the context of power purchasing.  

(13) To ensure that the benefits of installing renewable resources are available to all Illinois residents and located across the State, subject to appropriation, it is necessary for the Agency to provide public information and educational resources on how residents can benefit from the expansion of renewable energy in Illinois and participate in the Illinois Solar for All Program established in Section 1-56, the Adjustable Block program established in Section 1-75, the job training programs established by paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of Section 16-108.12 of the Public  

Utilities Act, and the programs and resources established by the Energy Transition Act.  

The General Assembly therefore finds that it is necessary to create the Illinois Power Agency and that the goals and objectives of that Agency are to accomplish each of the following:  

(A) Develop electricity procurement plans to ensure adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and environmentally sustainable electric service at the lowest total cost over time, taking into account any benefits of price stability, for electric utilities that on December 31, 2005 provided electric service to at least 100,000 customers in Illinois and for small multi-jurisdictional electric utilities that (i) on December 31, 2005 served less than 100,000 customers in Illinois and (ii) request a procurement plan for their Illinois jurisdictional load. The procurement plan shall be updated on an annual basis and shall include renewable energy resources and, beginning with the delivery year commencing June 1, 2017, zero emission credits from zero emission facilities sufficient to achieve the standards specified in this Act.  

(B) Conduct the competitive procurement processes identified in this Act.  

(C) Develop electric generation and co-generation facilities that use indigenous coal or renewable resources, or both, financed with bonds issued by the  

Illinois Finance Authority.  

(D) Supply electricity from the Agency's facilities at cost to one or more of the following: municipal electric systems, governmental aggregators, or rural electric cooperatives in Illinois.  

(E) Ensure that the process of power procurement is conducted in an ethical and transparent fashion, immune from improper influence.  

(F) Continue to review its policies and practices to determine how best to meet its mission of providing the lowest cost power to the greatest number of people, at any given point in time, in accordance with applicable law.  

(G) Operate in a structurally insulated, independent, and transparent fashion so that nothing impedes the Agency's mission to secure power at the best prices the market will bear, provided that the Agency meets all applicable legal requirements.  

(H) Implement renewable energy procurement and training programs throughout the State to diversify Illinois electricity supply, improve reliability, avoid and reduce pollution, reduce peak demand, and enhance public health and well-being of Illinois residents, including low-income residents.

The allocation of funds among subparagraphs (A), (B), or (C), and (E) of this paragraph (2) may be changed if the Agency, after receiving input through a stakeholder process, or administrator, through delegated authority, determines incentives in subparagraphs (A), (B), or (C), or (E) of this paragraph (2) have not been adequately subscribed to fully utilize available Illinois Solar for All Program funds the Illinois Power Agency Renewable Energy Resources Fund. The determination shall include input through a stakeholder process. The program offerings described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of this paragraph (2) shall also be implemented through contracts funded from such additional amounts as are allocated to one or more of the programs in the long-term renewable resources procurement plans as specified in subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of this Act and subparagraph (O) of paragraph (1) of such subsection (c).  

Contracts that will be paid with funds in the Illinois Power Agency Renewable Energy Resources Fund shall be executed by the Agency. Contracts that will be paid with funds collected by an electric utility shall be executed by the electric utility.  

Contracts under the Illinois Solar for All Program shall include an approach, as set forth in the long-term renewable resources procurement plans, to ensure the wholesale market value of the energy is credited to participating low-income customers or organizations and to ensure tangible economic benefits flow directly to program participants, except in the case of low-income multi-family housing where the low-income customer does not directly pay for energy. Priority shall be given to projects that demonstrate meaningful involvement of low-income community members in designing the initial proposals. Acceptable proposals to implement projects must demonstrate the applicant's ability to conduct initial community outreach, education, and recruitment of low-income participants in the community. Projects must include job training opportunities if available, with the specific level of trainee usage to be determined through the Agency's long-term renewable resources procurement plan, and the Illinois Solar for All Program Administrator shall endeavor to coordinate with the job training programs described in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of Section 16-108.12 of the Public Utilities Act and in the Energy Transition Act.

The Agency shall report on progress and barriers to participation of small and emerging businesses in the Illinois Solar for All Program at least once a year. The report shall be made available on the Agency's website and, in years when the Agency is updating its long-term renewable resources procurement plan, included in that Plan.  

(A) Low-income single-family and small multifamily solar distributed generation incentive. This program will provide incentives to low-income customers, either directly or through solar providers, to increase the participation of low-income households in photovoltaic on-site distributed generation at residential buildings containing one to 4 units. Companies participating in this program that install solar panels shall commit to hiring job trainees for a portion of their low-income installations, and an administrator shall facilitate partnering the companies that install solar panels with entities that provide solar panel installation job training. It is a goal of this program that a minimum of $25\%$ of the incentives for this program be allocated to projects located within environmental justice communities.  

Contracts entered into under this paragraph may be entered into with an entity that will develop and administer the program and shall also include contracts for renewable energy credits from the photovoltaic distributed generation that is the subject of the program, as set forth in the long-term renewable resources procurement plan. Additionally:  

(i) The Agency shall reserve a portion of this program for projects that promote energy sovereignty through ownership of projects by low-income households, not-for-profit organizations providing services to low-income households, affordable housing owners, community cooperatives, or community-based limited liability companies providing services to low-income households. Projects that feature energy ownership should ensure that local people have control of the project and reap benefits from the project over and above energy bill savings. The Agency may consider the inclusion of projects that promote ownership over time or that involve partial project ownership by communities, as promoting energy sovereignty. Incentives for projects that promote energy sovereignty may be higher than incentives for equivalent projects that do not promote energy sovereignty under this same  

program.  

(ii) Through its long-term renewable resources procurement plan, the Agency shall consider additional program and contract requirements to ensure faithful compliance by applicants benefiting from preferences for projects designated to promote energy sovereignty.

Incentives shall be offered to low-income customers, either directly or through developers, to increase the participation of low-income subscribers of community solar projects. The developer of each project shall identify its partnership with community stakeholders regarding the location, development, and participation in the project, provided that nothing shall preclude a project from including an anchor tenant that does not qualify as low-income. Companies participating in this program that develop or install solar projects shall commit to hiring job trainees for a portion of their low-income installations, and an administrator shall facilitate partnering the companies that install solar projects with entities that provide solar installation and related job training. Incentives should also be offered to community solar projects that are 100% low-income subscriber owned, which includes low-income households, not-for-profit organizations, and affordable housing owners. It is a goal of this program that a minimum of $25\%$ of the incentives for this program be allocated to community photovoltaic projects in environmental justice communities. The Agency shall reserve a portion of this program for projects that promote energy sovereignty through ownership of projects by low-income households, not-for-profit organizations providing services to low-income households, affordable housing owners, or community-based limited liability companies providing services to low-income households. Projects that feature energy ownership should ensure that local people have control of the project and reap benefits from the project over and above energy bill savings. The Agency may consider the inclusion of projects that promote ownership over time or that involve partial project ownership by communities, as promoting energy sovereignty. Incentives for projects that promote energy sovereignty may be higher than incentives for equivalent projects that do not promote energy sovereignty under this same program. Contracts entered into under this paragraph may be entered into with developers and shall also include contracts for renewable energy credits related to the program.  

(C) Incentives for non-profits and public facilities. Under this program funds shall be used to support on-site photovoltaic distributed renewable energy generation devices to serve the load associated with not-for-profit customers and to support photovoltaic distributed renewable energy generation that uses photovoltaic technology to serve the load associated with public sector customers taking service at public buildings. Companies participating in this program that develop or install solar projects shall commit to hiring job trainees for a portion of their low-income installations, and an administrator shall facilitate partnering the companies that install solar projects with entities that provide solar installation and related job training. Through its long-term renewable resources procurement plan, the Agency shall consider additional program and contract requirements to ensure faithful compliance by applicants benefiting from preferences for projects designated to promote energy sovereignty. It is a goal of this program that at least $25\%$ of the incentives for this program be allocated to projects located in environmental justice communities. Contracts entered into under this paragraph may be entered into with an entity that will develop and administer the program or with developers and shall also include contracts for renewable energy credits related to the program.  

(D) (Blank). Low-Income Community Solar Pilot Projects. Under this program, persons, including, but not limited to, electric utilities, shall propose pilot community solar projects. Community solar projects proposed under this subparagraph (D) may exceed 2,000 kilowatts in nameplate capacity, but the amount paid per project under this program may not exceed \$20,000,000. Pilot projects must result in economic benefits for the members of the community in which the project will be located. The proposed pilot project must include a partnership with at least one community-based organization. Approved pilot projects shall be competitively bid by the Agency, subject to fair and equitable guidelines developed by the Agency. Funding available under this subparagraph (D) may not be distributed solely to a utility, and at least some funds under this subparagraph (D) must include a project partnership that includes community ownership by the project subscribers. Contracts entered into under this paragraph may be entered into with an entity that will develop and administer the program or with developers and shall also include contracts for renewable energy credits related to the program. A project proposed by a utility that is implemented under this subparagraph (D) shall not be included in the utility's ratebase.  

(E) Low-income large multifamily solar incentive. This program shall provide incentives to low-income customers, either directly or through solar providers, to increase the participation of low-income households in photovoltaic on-site distributed generation at residential buildings with 5 or more units. Companies participating in this program that develop or install solar projects shall commit to hiring job trainees for a portion of their low-income installations, and an administrator shall facilitate partnering the companies that install solar projects with entities that provide solar installation and related job training. It is a goal of this program that a minimum of 25% of the incentives for this program be allocated to projects located within environmental justice communities. The Agency shall reserve a portion of this program for projects that promote energy sovereignty through ownership of projects by low-income households, not-for-profit organizations providing services to low-income households, affordable housing owners, or community-based limited liability companies providing services to low-income households. Projects that feature energy ownership should ensure that local people have control o f the project and reap benefits from the project over and above energy bill savings. The Agency may consider the inclusion of projects that promote ownership over time or that involve partial project ownership by communities, as promoting energy sovereignty. Incentives for projects that promote energy sovereignty may be higher than incentives for equivalent projects that do not promote energy sovereignty under this same program.  

The requirement that a qualified person, as defined in paragraph (1) of subsection (i) of this Section, install photovoltaic devices does not apply to the Illinois Solar for All Program described in this subsection (b).  

In addition to the programs outlined in paragraphs (A) through (E), the Agency and other parties may propose additional programs through the Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan developed and approved under paragraph (5) of subsection (b) of Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. Additional programs may target market segments not specified above and may also include incentives targeted to increase the uptake of nonphotovoltaic technologies by low-income customers, including energy storage paired with photovoltaics, if the Commission determines that the Illinois Solar for All Program would provide greater benefits to the public health and well-being of low-income residents through also supporting that additional program versus supporting programs already authorized.  

(3) Costs associated with the Illinois Solar for All Program and its components described in paragraph (2) of this subsection (b), including, but not limited to, costs associated with procuring experts, consultants, and the program administrator referenced in this subsection (b) and related incremental costs, costs related to income verification and facilitating customer participation in the program, and costs related to the evaluation of the  

Illinois Solar for All Program, may be paid for using monies in the Illinois Power Agency Renewable Energy Resources Fund, and funds allocated pursuant to subparagraph (O) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75, but the Agency or program administrator shall strive to minimize costs in the implementation of the program. The Agency or contracting electric utility shall purchase renewable energy credits from generation that is the subject of a contract under subparagraphs (A) through (E) (D) of this paragraph (2) of this subsection (b), and may pay for such renewable energy credits through an upfront payment per installed kilowatt of nameplate capacity paid once the device is interconnected at the distribution system level of the interconnecting utility and verified as is energized. Payments for renewable energy credits The payment shall be in exchange for an assignment of all renewable energy credits generated by the system during the first 15 years of operation and shall be structured to overcome barriers to participation in the solar market by the low-income community. The incentives provided for in this Section may be implemented through the pricing of renewable energy credits where the prices paid for the credits are higher than the prices from programs offered under subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of this Act to account for the additional capital necessary to successfully access targeted market segments incentives. The Agency shall ensure collaboration with community agencies, and allocate up to 5% of the funds available under the Illinois Solar for All Program to community-based groups to assist in grassroots education efforts related to the Illinois Solar for All Program. The Agency or contracting electric utility shall retire any renewable energy credits purchased under from this program and the credits shall count towards the obligation under subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of this Act for the electric utility to which the project is interconnected, if applicable.  

The Agency shall direct that up to 5% of the funds available under the Illinois Solar for All Program to community-based groups and other qualifying organizations to assist in community-driven education efforts related to the Illinois Solar for All Program, including general energy education, job training program outreach efforts, and other activities deemed to be qualified by the Agency. Grassroots education funding shall not be used to support the marketing by solar project development firms and organizations, unless such education provides equal opportunities for all applicable firms and organizations.  

(4) The Agency shall, consistent with the requirements of this subsection (b), propose the Illinois Solar for All Program terms, conditions, and requirements, including the prices to be paid for renewable energy credits, and which prices may be determined through a formula, through the development, review, and approval of the Agency's long-term renewable resources procurement plan described in subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of this Act and Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. In the course of the Commission proceeding initiated to review and approve the plan, including the Illinois Solar for All Program proposed by the Agency, a party may propose an additional low-income solar or solar incentive program, or modifications to the programs proposed by the Agency, and the Commission may approve an additional program, or modifications to the Agency's proposed program, if the additional or modified program more effectively maximizes the benefits to low-income customers after taking into account all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the extent to which a competitive market for low-income solar has developed. Following the Commission's approval of the Illinois Solar for All Program, the Agency or a party may propose adjustments to the program terms, conditions, and requirements, including the price offered to new systems, to ensure the long-term viability and success of the program. The Commission shall review and approve any modifications to the program through the plan revision process described in Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act.  

(5) The Agency shall issue a request for qualifications for a third-party program administrator or administrators to administer all or a portion of the Illinois Solar for All Program. The third-party program administrator shall be chosen through a competitive bid process based on selection criteria and requirements developed by the Agency, including, but not limited to, experience in administering low-income energy programs and overseeing statewide clean energy or energy efficiency services. If the Agency retains a program administrator or administrators to implement all or a portion of the Illinois Solar for All Program, each administrator shall periodically submit reports to the Agency and Commission for each program that it administers, at appropriate intervals to be identified by the Agency in its long-term renewable resources procurement plan, provided that the reporting interval is at least quarterly. The third-party program administrator may be, but need not be, the same administrator as for the Adjustable Block program described in subparagraphs (K) through (M) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75. The Agency, through its long-term renewable resources procurement plan approval process, shall also determine if individual subprograms of the Illinois Solar for All Program are better served by a different or separate Program Administrator. The third-party administrator's responsibilities shall also include facilitating placement for graduates of Illinois-based renewable energy-specific job training programs, including the Clean Jobs Workforce Network Program and the Illinois Climate Works Preapprenticeship Program administered by the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and programs administered under Section 16-108.12 of the Public Utilities Act. To increase the uptake of trainees by participating firms, the administrator shall also develop a web-based clearinghouse for information available to both job training program graduates and firms participating, directly or indirectly, in Illinois solar incentive programs. The program administrator shall also coordinate its activities with entities implementing electric and natural gas income-qualified energy efficiency programs, including customer referrals to and from such programs, and connect prospective low-income solar customers with any existing deferred maintenance programs where applicable.  

(6) The long-term renewable resources procurement plan shall also provide for an independent evaluation of the Illinois Solar for All Program. At least every 2 years, the Agency shall select an independent evaluator to review and report on the Illinois Solar for All Program and the performance of the third-party program administrator of the Illinois Solar for All Program.

(2) The Agency shall each year, as needed, issue a request for qualifications for a procurement administrator to conduct the competitive procurement processes in accordance with Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. In order to qualify an expert or expert consulting firm must have:  

(A) direct previous experience administering a large-scale competitive procurement process; (B) an advanced degree in economics, mathematics, engineering, or a related area of study; (C) 10 years of experience in the electricity sector, including risk management experience; (D) expertise in wholesale electricity market rules, including those established by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and regional transmission organizations; (E) expertise in credit and contract protocols; (F) adequate resources to perform and fulfill the required functions and responsibilities; and  

(G) the absence of a conflict of interest and inappropriate bias for or against potential bidders or the affected electric utilities.  

(3) The Agency shall provide affected utilities and other interested parties with the lists of qualified experts or expert consulting firms identified through the request for qualifications processes that are under consideration to develop the procurement plans and to serve as the procurement administrator. The Agency shall also provide each qualified expert's or expert consulting firm's response to the request for qualifications. All information provided under this subparagraph shall also be provided to the Commission. The Agency may provide by rule for fees associated with supplying the information to utilities and other interested parties. These parties shall, within 5 business days, notify the Agency in writing if they object to any experts or expert consulting firms on the lists. Objections shall be based on:  

(A) failure to satisfy qualification criteria; (B) identification of a conflict of interest; or (C) evidence of inappropriate bias for or against ential bidders or the affected utilities.  

The Agency shall remove experts or expert consulting firms from the lists within 10 days if there is a reasonable basis for an objection and provide the updated lists to the affected utilities and other interested parties. If the Agency fails to remove an expert or expert consulting firm from a list, an objecting party may seek review by the Commission within 5 days thereafter by filing a petition, and the Commission shall render a ruling on the petition within 10 days. There is no right of appeal of the Commission's ruling.  

(4) The Agency shall issue requests for proposals to the qualified experts or expert consulting firms to develop a procurement plan for the affected utilities and to serve as procurement administrator.  

(5) The Agency shall select an expert or expert consulting firm to develop procurement plans based on the proposals submitted and shall award contracts of up to 5 years to those selected.  

(6) The Agency shall select an expert or expert consulting firm, with approval of the Commission, to serve as procurement administrator based on the proposals submitted. If the Commission rejects, within 5 days, the Agency's selection, the Agency shall submit another recommendation within 3 days based on the proposals submitted. The Agency shall award a 5-year contract to the expert or expert consulting firm so selected with Commission approval.  

(b) The experts or expert consulting firms retained by the Agency shall, as appropriate, prepare procurement plans, and conduct a competitive procurement process as prescribed in  

Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act, to ensure adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and environmentally sustainable electric service at the lowest total cost over time, taking into account any benefits of price stability, for eligible retail customers of electric utilities that on December 31, 2005 provided electric service to at least 100,000 customers in the State of Illinois, and for eligible Illinois retail customers of small multi-jurisdictional electric utilities that (i) on December 31, 2005 served less than 100,000 customers in Illinois and (ii) request a procurement plan for their Illinois jurisdictional load.  

(c) Renewable portfolio standard.  

(1)(A) The Agency shall develop a long-term renewable resources procurement plan that shall include procurement programs and competitive procurement events necessary to meet the goals set forth in this subsection (c). The initial long-term renewable resources procurement plan shall be released for comment no later than 160 days after June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906). The Agency shall review, and may revise on an expedited basis, the long-term renewable resources procurement plan at least every 2 years, which shall be conducted in conjunction with the procurement plan under Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act to the extent practicable to minimize administrative expense. No later than 120 days after the effective date of this amendatory  

Act of the 102nd General Assembly, the Agency shall release for comment a revision to the long-term renewable resources procurement plan, updating elements of the most recently approved plan as needed to comply with this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, and any long-term renewable resources procurement plan update published by the Agency but not yet approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission shall be withdrawn. The long-term renewable resources procurement plans shall be subject to review and approval by the Commission under Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act.  

(B) Subject to subparagraph (F) of this paragraph (1), the long-term renewable resources procurement plan shall attempt to meet include the goals for procurement of renewable energy credits at levels of to meet at least the following overall percentages: $13\%$ by the 2017 delivery year; increasing by at least 1.5% each delivery year thereafter to at least $25\%$ by the 2025 delivery year; increasing by at least $3\%$ each delivery year thereafter to at least 40% by the 2030 delivery year, and continuing at no less than 40% 25% for each delivery year thereafter. The Agency shall attempt to procure 50% by delivery year 2040. The Agency shall determine the annual increase between delivery year 2030 and delivery year 2040, if any, taking into account energy demand, other energy resources, and other public policy goals. In the event of a conflict between these goals and the new wind and new photovoltaic procurement requirements described in items (i) through (iii) of subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (1), the long-term plan shall prioritize compliance with the new wind and new photovoltaic procurement requirements described in items (i) through (iii) of subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (1) over the annual percentage targets described in this subparagraph (B). The Agency shall not comply with the annual percentage targets described in this subparagraph (B) by procuring renewable energy credits that are unlikely to lead to the development of new renewable resources.  

For the delivery year beginning June 1, 2017, the procurement plan shall attempt to include, subject to the prioritization outlined in this subparagraph (B), cost-effective renewable energy resources equal to at least $13\%$ of each utility's load for eligible retail customers and $13\%$ of the applicable portion of each utility's load for retail customers who are not eligible retail customers, which applicable portion shall equal $50\%$ of the utility's load for retail customers who are not eligible retail customers on February 28, 2017.  

For the delivery year beginning June 1, 2018, the procurement plan shall attempt to include, subject to the prioritization outlined in this subparagraph (B), cost-effective renewable energy resources equal to at least 14.5% of each utility's load for eligible retail customers and $14.5\%$ of the applicable portion of each utility's load for retail customers who are not eligible retail customers, which applicable portion shall equal $75\%$ of the utility's load for retail customers who are not eligible retail customers on February 28, 2017.  

For the delivery year beginning June 1, 2019, and for each year thereafter, the procurement plans shall attempt to include, subject to the prioritization outlined in this subparagraph (B), cost-effective renewable energy resources equal to a minimum percentage of each utility's load for all retail customers as follows: $16\%$ by June 1, 2019; increasing by 1.5% each year thereafter to $25\%$ by June 1, 2025; and $25\%$ by June 1, 2026; increasing by at least 3% each delivery year thereafter to at least 40% by the 2030 delivery year, and continuing at no less than 40% for each delivery year thereafter. The Agency shall attempt to procure 50% by delivery year 2040. The Agency shall determine the annual increase between delivery year 2030 and delivery year 2040, if any, taking into account energy demand, other energy resources, and other public policy goals.  

For each delivery year, the Agency shall first recognize each utility's obligations for that delivery year under existing contracts. Any renewable energy credits under existing contracts, including renewable energy credits as part of renewable energy resources, shall be used to meet the goals set forth in this subsection (c) for the delivery year.  

(C) Of the renewable energy credits procured under this subsection (c), at least 75% shall come from wind and photovoltaic projects. The long-term renewable resources procurement plan described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (1) shall include the procurement of renewable energy credits from new projects in amounts equal to at least the following:  

(i) 10,000,000 renewable energy credits delivered annually by the end of the 2021 delivery year, and increasing ratably to reach 45,000,000 renewable energy credits delivered annually from new wind and solar projects by the end of delivery year 2030 such that the goals in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (1) are met entirely by procurements of renewable energy credits from new wind and photovoltaic projects. Of By the end of the 2020 delivery year: At least 2,000,000 renewable energy credits for each delivery year shall come from new wind projects; and At least 2, Z 000,000 renewable energy credits for each delivery year shall come from new photovoltaic projects; of that amount, to the extent possible, the Agency shall procure 45% from wind projects and 55% from photovoltaic projects. Of the amount to be procured from photovoltaic projects, the Agency shall procure: at least $50\%$ from solar photovoltaic projects using the program outlined in subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1) from distributed renewable energy generation devices or community renewable generation projects; at least 47% 40% from utility-scale solar projects; at least 3% 2% from brownfield site photovoltaic projects that are not community renewable generation projects; and the remainder shall be determined through the long-term planning process described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (1).  

In developing the long-term renewable resources procurement plan, the Agency shall consider other approaches, in addition to competitive procurements, that can be used to procure renewable energy credits from brownfield site photovoltaic projects and thereby help return blighted or contaminated land to productive use while enhancing public health and the well-being of Illinois residents, including those in environmental justice communities, as defined using existing methodologies and findings used by the Agency and its Administrator in its Illinois Solar for All Program.  

(ii) In any given delivery year, if forecasted expenses are less than the maximum budget available under subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (1), the  

Agency shall continue to procure new renewable energy credits until that budget is exhausted in the manner outlined in item (i) of this subparagraph (C). By the end of the 2025 delivery year:  

At least 3,000,000 renewable energy credits for each delivery year shall come from new wind projects; and  

At least 3,000,000 renewable energy credits for each delivery year shall come from new photovoltaic projects; of that amount, to the extent possible, the Agency shall procure: at least 50% from solar photovoltaic projects using the program outlined in subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1) from distributed renewable energy devices or community renewable generation projects; at least 40% from utility-scale solar projects; at least 2% from brownfield site photovoltaic projects that are not community renewable generation projects; and the remainder shall be determined through the long-term planning process described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (1).  

(iii) By the end of the 2030 delivery year:  

At least 4,000,000 renewable energy credits for each delivery year shall come from new wind projects; and  

At least 4,000,000 renewable energy credits for each delivery year shall come from new photovoltaic projects; of that amount, to the extent possible, the Agency shall procure: at least 50% from solar photovoltaic projects using the program outlined in subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1) from distributed renewable energy devices or community renewable generation projects; at least 40% from utility-scale solar projects; at least 2% from brownfield site photovoltaic projects that are not community renewable generation projects; and the remainder shall be determined through the long-term planning process described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (1).  

(iii) For purposes of this Section:  

"New wind projects" means wind renewable energy facilities that are energized after June 1, 2017 for the delivery year commencing June 1, 2017 or within 3 years after the date the Commission approves contracts for subsequent delivery years.  

"New photovoltaic projects" means photovoltaic renewable energy facilities that are energized after June 1, 2017. Photovoltaic projects developed under Section 1-56 of this Act shall not apply towards the new photovoltaic project requirements in this  

subparagraph (C).  

For purposes of calculating whether the Agency has procured enough new wind and solar renewable energy credits required by this subparagraph (C), renewable energy facilities that have a multi-year renewable energy credit delivery contract with the utility through at least delivery year 2030 shall be considered new, however no renewable energy credits from contracts entered into before June 1, 2021 shall be used to calculate whether the Agency has procured the correct proportion of new wind and new solar contracts described in this subparagraph (C) for delivery year 2021 and thereafter.  

(D) Renewable energy credits shall be cost effective. For purposes of this subsection (c), "cost effective" means that the costs of procuring renewable energy resources do not cause the limit stated in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (1) to be exceeded and, for renewable energy credits procured through a competitive procurement event, do not exceed benchmarks based on market prices for like products in the region. For purposes of this subsection (c), "like products" means contracts for renewable energy credits from the same or substantially similar technology, same or substantially similar vintage (new or existing), the same or substantially similar quantity, and the same or substantially similar contract length and structure. Benchmarks shall reflect development, financing, or related costs resulting from requirements imposed through other provisions of State law, including, but not limited to, requirements in subparagraphs (P) and (Q) of this paragraph (1) and the Renewable Energy Facilities Agricultural Impact Mitigation Act. Confidential benchmarks Benchmarks shall be developed by the procurement administrator, in consultation with the Commission staff, Agency staff, and the procurement monitor and shall be subject to Commission review and approval. If price benchmarks for like products in the region are not available, the procurement administrator shall establish price benchmarks based on publicly available data on regional technology costs and expected current and future regional energy prices. The benchmarks in this Section shall not be used to curtail or otherwise reduce contractual obligations entered into by or through the Agency prior to June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906).  

(E) For purposes of this subsection (c), the required procurement of cost-effective renewable energy resources for a particular year commencing prior to June 1, 2017 shall be measured as a percentage of the actual amount of electricity (megawatt-hours) supplied by the electric utility to eligible retail customers in the delivery year ending immediately prior to the procurement, and, for delivery years commencing on and after June 1, 2017, the required procurement of cost-effective renewable energy resources for a particular year shall be measured as a percentage of the actual amount of electricity (megawatt-hours) delivered by the electric utility in the delivery year ending immediately prior to the procurement, to all retail customers in its service territory. For purposes of this subsection (c), the amount paid per kilowatthour means the total amount paid for electric service expressed on a per kilowatthour basis. For purposes of this subsection (c), the total amount paid for electric service includes without limitation amounts paid for supply, transmission, capacity, distribution, surcharges, and add-on taxes.  

Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection (c), the total of renewable energy resources procured under the procurement plan for any single year shall be subject to the limitations of this subparagraph (E). Such procurement shall be reduced for all retail customers based on the amount necessary to limit the annual estimated average net increase due to the costs of these resources included in the amounts paid by eligible retail customers in connection with electric service to no more than 4.25% the greater of 2.015% of the amount paid per kilowatthour by those customers during the year ending May  

31, 2009 2007 or the incremental amount per kilowatthour paid for these resources in 2011. To arrive at a maximum dollar amount of renewable energy resources to be procured for the particular delivery year, the resulting per kilowatthour amount shall be applied to the actual amount of kilowatthours of electricity delivered, or applicable portion of such amount as specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection (c), as applicable, by the electric utility in the delivery year immediately prior to the procurement to all retail customers in its service territory. The calculations required by this subparagraph (E) shall be made only once for each delivery year at the time that the renewable energy resources are procured. Once the determination as to the amount of renewable energy resources to procure is made based on the calculations set forth in this subparagraph (E) and the contracts procuring those amounts are executed, no subsequent rate impact determinations shall be made and no adjustments to those contract amounts shall be allowed. All costs incurred under such contracts shall be fully recoverable by the electric utility as provided in this Section.  

(F) If the limitation on the amount of renewable energy resources procured in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (1) prevents the Agency from meeting all of the goals in this subsection (c), the Agency's long-term plan shall prioritize compliance with the requirements of this subsection (c) regarding renewable energy credits in the following order:  

(i) renewable energy credits under existing contractual obligations as of June 1, 2021; (i-5) funding for the Illinois Solar for All Program, as described in subparagraph (O) of this paragraph (1);  

(ii) renewable energy credits necessary to comply with the new wind and new photovoltaic procurement requirements described in items (i) through (iii) of subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (1); and  

(iii) renewable energy credits necessary to meet the remaining requirements of this subsection (c).  

(G) The following provisions shall apply to the Agency's procurement of renewable energy credits under this subsection (c):  

(i) Notwithstanding whether a long-term renewable resources procurement plan has been approved, the Agency shall conduct an initial forward procurement for renewable energy credits from new utility-scale wind projects within 160 days after June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906). For the purposes of this initial forward procurement, the Agency shall solicit 15-year contracts for delivery of 1,000,000 renewable energy credits delivered annually from new utility-scale wind projects to begin delivery on June 1, 2019, if available, but not later than June 1, 2021, unless the project has delays in the establishment of an operating interconnection with the applicable transmission or distribution system as a result of the actions or inactions of the transmission or distribution provider, or other causes for force majeure as outlined in the procurement contract, in which case, not later than June 1, 2022. Payments to suppliers of renewable energy credits shall commence upon delivery. Renewable energy credits procured under this initial procurement shall be included in the Agency's long-term plan and shall apply to all renewable energy goals in this subsection (c).  

(ii) Notwithstanding whether a long-term renewable resources procurement plan has been approved, the Agency shall conduct an initial forward procurement for renewable energy credits from new utility-scale solar projects and brownfield site photovoltaic projects within one year after June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906). For the purposes of this initial forward procurement, the Agency shall solicit 15-year contracts for delivery of 1,000,000 renewable energy credits delivered annually from new utility-scale solar projects and brownfield site photovoltaic projects to begin delivery on June 1,  

2019, if available, but not later than June 1, 2021, unless the project has delays in the establishment of an operating interconnection with the applicable transmission or distribution system as a result of the actions or inactions of the transmission or distribution provider, or other causes for force majeure as outlined in the procurement contract, in which case, not later than June 1, 2022. The Agency may structure this initial procurement in one or more discrete procurement events. Payments to suppliers of renewable energy credits shall commence upon delivery. Renewable energy credits procured under this initial procurement shall be included in the Agency's long-term plan and shall apply to all renewable energy goals in this subsection (c).  

(iii) Notwithstanding whether the Commission has approved the periodic long-term renewable resources procurement plan revision described in Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act, the Agency shall conduct at least one subsequent forward procurement for renewable energy credits from new utility-scale wind projects, new utility-scale solar projects, and new brownfield site photovoltaic projects within 240 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly in quantities necessary to meet the requirements of subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (1) through the delivery year beginning June 1, 2021. Subsequent forward procurements for utility-scale wind projects shall solicit at least 1,000,000 renewable energy credits delivered annually per procurement event and shall be planned, scheduled, and designed such that the cumulative amount of renewable energy credits delivered from all new wind projects in each delivery year shall not exceed the Agency's projection of the cumulative amount of renewable energy credits that will be delivered from all new photovoltaic projects, including utility-scale and distributed photovoltaic devices, in the same delivery year at the time scheduled for wind contract delivery.  

(iv) Notwithstanding whether the Commission has approved the periodic long-term renewable resources procurement plan revision described in Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act, the Agency shall open capacity for each category in the Adjustable Block program within 90 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly manner:  

#  

(1) The Agency shall open the first block of annual capacity for the category described in item (i) of subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1). The first block of annual capacity for item (i) shall be for at least 75 megawatts of total nameplate capacity. The price of the renewable energy credit for this block of capacity shall be 4% less than the price of the last open block in this category. Projects on a waitlist shall be awarded contracts first in the order in which they appear on the waitlist. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for those renewable energy credits that qualify and are procured under this subitem (1) of this item (iv), the renewable energy credit delivery contract value shall be paid in full, based on the estimated generation during the first 15 years of operation, by the contracting utilities at the time that the facility producing the renewable energy credits is interconnected at the distribution system level of the utility and verified as energized and in compliance by the Program Administrator. The electric utility shall receive and retire all renewable energy credits generated by the project for the first 15 years of operation. Renewable energy credits generated by the project thereafter shall not be transferred under the renewable energy credit delivery contract with the counterparty electric utility. (2) The Agency shall open the first block of annual capacity for the category described in item (ii) of subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1). The first block of annual capacity for item (ii) shall be for at least 75 megawatts of total nameplate capacity.  

(A) The price of the renewable energy credit for any project on a waitlist for this category before the opening of this block shall be 4% less than the price of the last open block in this category. Projects on the waitlist shall be awarded contracts first in the order in which they appear on the waitlist. Any projects that are less than or equal to 25 kilowatts in size on the waitlist for this capacity shall be moved to the waitlist for paragraph (1) of this item (iv). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, projects that were on the waitlist prior to opening of this block shall not be required to be in compliance with the requirements of subparagraph (Q) of this paragraph (1) of this subsection (c). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for those renewable energy credits procured from projects that were on the waitlist for this category before the opening of this block 20% of the renewable energy credit delivery contract value, based on the estimated generation during the first 15 years of operation, shall be paid by the contracting utilities at the time that the facility producing the renewable energy credits is interconnected at the distribution system level of the utility and verified as energized by the Program Administrator. The remaining portion shall be paid ratably over the subsequent 4-year period. The electric utility shall receive and retire all renewable energy credits generated by the project during the first 15 years of operation. Renewable energy credits generated by the project thereafter shall not be transferred under the renewable energy credit delivery contract with the counterparty electric utility.  

(B) The price of renewable energy credits for any project not on the waitlist for this category before the opening of the block shall be determined and published by the Agency. Projects not on a waitlist as of the opening of this block shall be subject to the requirements of subparagraph (Q) of this paragraph (1), as applicable. Projects not on a waitlist as of the opening of this block shall be subject to the contract provisions outlined in item (iii) of subparagraph (L) of this paragraph (1). The Agency shall strive to publish updated prices and an updated renewable energy credit delivery contract as quickly as possible.  

(3) For opening the first 2 blocks of annual capacity for projects participating in item (iii) of subparagraph (K) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c), projects shall be selected exclusively from those projects on the ordinal waitlists of community renewable generation projects established by the Agency based on the status of those ordinal waitlists as of December 31, 2020, and only those projects previously determined to be eligible for the Agency's April 2019 community solar project selection process.  

The first 2 blocks of annual capacity for item (iii) shall be for 250 megawatts of total nameplate capacity, with both blocks opening simultaneously under the schedule outlined in the paragraphs below. Projects shall be selected as follows:  

(A) The geographic balance of selected projects shall follow the Group classification found in the Agency's Revised Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan, with 70% of capacity allocated to projects on the Group B waitlist and 30% of capacity allocated to projects on the Group A waitlist.  

(B) Contract awards for waitlisted   
projects shall be allocated proportionate to   
the total nameplate capacity amount across   
both ordinal waitlists associated with that   
applicant firm or its affiliates, subject to following conditions. (i) Each applicant firm having a waitlisted project eligible for selection shall receive no less than 500 kilowatts in awarded capacity across all groups, and no approved vendor may receive more than 20% of each Group's waitlist allocation. (ii) Each applicant firm, upon receiving an award of program capacity proportionate to its waitlisted capacity, may then determine which waitlisted projects it chooses to be selected for a contract award up to that capacity amount. (iii) Assuming all other program requirements are met, applicant firms may adjust the nameplate capacity of applicant projects without losing waitlist eligibility, so long as no project is  

greater than 2,000 kilowatts in size. (iv) Assuming all other program requirements are met, applicant firms may adjust the expected production associated with applicant projects, subject to verification by the Program Administrator. (C) After a review of affiliate information and the current ordinal waitlists, the Agency shall announce the nameplate capacity award amounts associated with applicant firms no later than 90 days after effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly.  

(D) Applicant firms shall submit their portfolio of projects used to satisfy those contract awards no less than 90 days after the Agency's announcement. The total nameplate capacity of all projects used to satisfy that portfolio shall be no greater than the Agency's nameplate capacity award amount associated with that applicant firm. An applicant firm may decline, in whole or in part, its nameplate capacity award without penalty, with such unmet capacity rolled over to the next block opening for project selection under item (iii) of subparagraph (K)  

of this subsection (c). Any projects not included in an applicant firm's portfolio may reapply without prejudice upon the next block reopening for project selection under item (iii) of subparagraph (K) of this subsection (c).  

(E) The renewable energy credit delivery contract shall be subject to the contract and payment terms outlined in item (iv) of subparagraph (L) of this subsection (c). Contract instruments used for this subparagraph shall contain the following  

# terms:  

(i) Renewable energy credit prices shall be fixed, without further adjustment under any other provision of this Act or for any other reason, at 10% lower than prices applicable to the last open block for this category, inclusive of any adders available for achieving a minimum of 50% of subscribers to the project's nameplate capacity being residential or small commercial customers with subscriptions of below 25 kilowatts in size;  

(ii) A requirement that a minimum of 50% of subscribers to the project's nameplate capacity be residential or small commercial customers with subscriptions of below 25 kilowatts in size;  

(iii) Permission for the ability of a contract holder to substitute projects with other waitlisted projects without penalty should a project receive a non-binding estimate of costs to construct the interconnection facilities and any required distribution upgrades associated with that project of greater than 30 cents per watt AC of that project's nameplate capacity. In developing the applicable contract instrument, the Agency may consider whether other circumstances outside of the control of the applicant firm should also warrant project substitution rights.  

The Agency shall publish a finalized updated renewable energy credit delivery contract developed consistent with these terms and conditions no less than 30 days before applicant firms must submit their portfolio of projects pursuant to item (D).  

(F) To be eligible for an award, the applicant firm shall certify that not less than prevailing wage, as determined pursuant to the Illinois Prevailing Wage Act, was or will be paid to employees who are engaged in construction activities associated with a selected project.  

(4) The Agency shall open the first block of annual capacity for the category described in item (iv) of subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1). The first block of annual capacity for item (iv) shall be for at least 50 megawatts of total nameplate capacity. Renewable energy credit prices shall be fixed, without further adjustment under any other provision of this Act or for any other reason, at the price in the last open block in the category described in item (ii) of subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1). Pricing for future blocks of annual capacity for this category may be adjusted in the Agency's second revision to its Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan. Projects in this category shall be subject to the contract terms outlined in item (iv) of subparagraph (L) of this paragraph (1).  

(5) The Agency shall open the equivalent of 2 years of annual capacity for the category described in item (v) of subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1). The first block of annual capacity for item (v) shall be for at least 10 megawatts of total nameplate capacity. Notwithstanding the provisions of item (v) of subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1), for the purpose of this initial block, the agency shall accept new project applications intended to increase the diversity of areas hosting community solar projects, the business models of projects, and the size of projects, as described by the Agency in its long-term renewable resources procurement plan that is approved as of the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly. Projects in this category shall be subject to the contract terms outlined in item (iii) of subsection (L) of this paragraph (1).  

(6) The Agency shall open the first blocks of annual capacity for the category described in item (vi) of subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1), with allocations of capacity within the block generally matching the historical share of block capacity allocated between the category described in items (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1). The first two blocks of annual capacity for item (vi) shall be for at least 75 megawatts of total nameplate capacity. The price of renewable energy credits for the blocks of capacity shall be 4% less than the price of the last open blocks in the categories described in items (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1). Pricing for future blocks of annual capacity for this category may be adjusted in the Agency's second revision to its Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan. Projects in this category shall be subject to the applicable contract terms outlined in items (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (L) of this paragraph (1). If, at any time after the time set for delivery of renewable energy credits pursuant to the initial procurements in items (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph (G), the cumulative amount of renewable energy credits projected to be delivered from all new wind projects in a given delivery year exceeds the cumulative amount of renewable energy credits projected to be delivered from all new photovoltaic projects in that delivery year by 200,000 or more renewable energy credits, then the Agency shall within 60 days adjust the procurement programs in the long-term renewable resources procurement plan to ensure that the projected cumulative amount of renewable energy credits to be delivered from all new wind projects does not exceed the projected cumulative amount of renewable energy credits to be delivered from all new photovoltaic projects by 200,000 or more renewable energy credits, provided that nothing in this Section shall preclude the projected cumulative amount of renewable energy credits to be delivered from all new photovoltaic projects from exceeding the projected cumulative amount of renewable energy credits to be delivered from all new wind projects in each delivery year and provided further that nothing in this item (iv) shall require the curtailment of an executed contract. The Agency shall update, on a quarterly basis, its projection of the renewable energy credits to be delivered from all projects in each delivery year. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Agency may adjust the timing of procurement events conducted under this subparagraph (G). The long-term renewable resources procurement plan shall set forth the process by which the adjustments may be made.  

(v) Upon the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, for all competitive procurements and any procurements of renewable energy credit from new utility-scale wind and new utility-scale photovoltaic projects, the Agency shall procure indexed renewable energy credits and direct respondents to offer a strike price.  

(1) The purchase price of the indexed renewable energy credit payment shall be calculated for each settlement period. That payment, for any settlement period, shall be equal to the difference resulting from subtracting the strike price from the index price for that settlement period. If this difference results in a negative number, the indexed REC counterparty shall owe the seller the absolute value multiplied by the quantity of energy produced in the relevant settlement period. If this difference results in a positive number, the seller shall owe the indexed REC counterparty this amount multiplied by the quantity of energy produced in the relevant settlement period.  

(2) Parties shall cash settle every month, summing up all settlements (both positive and negative, if applicable) for the prior month.  

(3) To ensure funding in the annual budget established under subparagraph (E) for indexed renewable energy credit procurements for each year of the term of such contracts, which must have a minimum tenure of 20 calendar years, the procurement administrator, Agency, Commission staff, and procurement monitor shall quantify the annual cost of the contract by utilizing an industry-standard, third-party forward price curve for energy at the appropriate hub or load zone, including the estimated magnitude and timing of the price effects related to federal carbon controls. Each forward price curve shall contain a specific value of the forecasted market price of electricity for each annual delivery year of the contract. For procurement planning purposes, the impact on the annual budget for the cost of indexed renewable energy credits for each delivery year shall be determined as the expected annual contract expenditure for that year, equaling the difference between (i) the sum across all relevant contracts of the applicable strike price multiplied by contract quantity and (ii) the sum across all relevant contracts of the forward price curve for the applicable load zone for that year multiplied by contract quantity. The contracting utility shall not assume an obligation in excess of the estimated annual cost of the contracts for indexed renewable energy credits. Forward curves shall be revised on an annual basis as updated forward price curves are released and filed with the Commission in the proceeding approving the Agency's most recent long-term renewable resources procurement plan. If the expected contract spend is higher or lower than the total quantity of contracts multiplied by the forward price curve value for that year, the forward price curve shall be updated by the procurement administrator, in consultation with the Agency, Commission staff, and procurement monitors, using then-currently available price forecast data and additional budget dollars shall be obligated or reobligated as appropriate.  

(4) To ensure that indexed renewable energy credit prices remain predictable and affordable, the Agency may consider the institution of a price collar on REC prices paid under indexed renewable energy credit procurements establishing floor and ceiling REC prices applicable to indexed REC contract prices. Any price collars applicable to indexed REC procurements shall be proposed by the Agency through its long-term renewable resources procurement plan. (vi) (v) All procurements under this subparagraph (G) shall comply with the geographic requirements in subparagraph (I) of this paragraph (1) and shall follow the procurement processes and procedures described in this Section and Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act to the extent practicable, and these processes and procedures may be expedited to accommodate the schedule established by this subparagraph (G).  

(H) The procurement of renewable energy resources for a given delivery year shall be reduced as described in this subparagraph (H) if an alternative retail electric supplier meets the requirements described in this subparagraph (H).  

(i) Within 45 days after June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906), an alternative retail electric supplier or its successor shall submit an informational filing to the Illinois Commerce Commission certifying that, as of December 31, 2015, the alternative retail electric supplier owned one or more electric generating facilities that generates renewable energy resources as defined in Section 1-10 of this Act, provided that such facilities are not powered by wind or photovoltaics, and the facilities generate one renewable energy credit for each megawatthour of energy produced from the facility.  

The informational filing shall identify each facility that was eligible to satisfy the alternative retail electric supplier's obligations under Section 16-115D of the Public Utilities Act as described in this item (i).  

(ii) For a given delivery year, the alternative retail electric supplier may elect to supply its retail customers with renewable energy credits from the facility or facilities described in item (i) of this subparagraph (H) that continue to be owned by the alternative retail electric supplier.  

(iii) The alternative retail electric supplier shall notify the Agency and the applicable utility, no later than February 28 of the year preceding the applicable delivery year or 15 days after June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906), whichever is later, of its election under item (ii) of this subparagraph (H) to supply renewable energy credits to retail customers of the utility. Such election shall identify the amount of renewable energy credits to be supplied by the alternative retail electric supplier to the utility's retail customers and the source of the renewable energy credits identified in the informational filing as described in item (i) of this subparagraph (H), subject to the following limitations:  

For the delivery year beginning June 1, 2018, the maximum amount of renewable energy credits to be supplied by an alternative retail electric supplier under this subparagraph (H) shall be $68\%$ multiplied by $25\%$ multiplied by $14.5\%$ multiplied by the amount of metered electricity (megawatt-hours) delivered by the alternative retail electric supplier to Illinois retail customers during the delivery year ending May 31, 2016.  

For delivery years beginning June 1, 2019 and each year thereafter, the maximum amount of renewable energy credits to be supplied by an alternative retail electric supplier under this subparagraph (H) shall be $68\%$ multiplied by $50\%$ multiplied by 16% multiplied by the amount of metered electricity (megawatt-hours) delivered by the alternative retail electric supplier to Illinois retail customers during the delivery year ending May 31, 2016, provided that the 16% value shall increase by 1.5% each delivery year thereafter to $25\%$ by the delivery year beginning June 1, 2025, and thereafter the $25\%$ value shall apply to each delivery year.  

For each delivery year, the total amount of renewable energy credits supplied by all alternative retail electric suppliers under this subparagraph (H) shall not exceed 9% of the Illinois target renewable energy credit quantity. The Illinois target renewable energy credit quantity for the delivery year beginning June 1, 2018 is $14.5\%$ multiplied by the total amount of metered electricity (megawatt-hours) delivered in the delivery year immediately preceding that delivery year, provided that the 14.5% shall increase by 1.5% each delivery year thereafter to $25\%$ by the delivery year beginning June 1, 2025, and thereafter the $25\%$ value shall apply to each delivery year.  

If the requirements set forth in items (i) through (iii) of this subparagraph (H) are met, the charges that would otherwise be applicable to the retail customers of the alternative retail electric supplier under paragraph (6) of this subsection (c) for the applicable delivery year shall be reduced by the ratio of the quantity of renewable energy credits supplied by the alternative retail electric supplier compared to that supplier's target renewable energy credit quantity. The supplier's target renewable energy credit quantity for the delivery year beginning June 1, 2018 is 14.5% multiplied by the total amount of metered electricity (megawatt-hours) delivered by the alternative retail supplier in that delivery year, provided that the 14.5% shall increase by 1.5% each delivery year thereafter to $25\%$ by the delivery year beginning June 1, 2025, and thereafter the $25\%$ value shall apply to each delivery year.  

On or before April 1 of each year, the Agency shall annually publish a report on its website that identifies the aggregate amount of renewable energy credits supplied by alternative retail electric suppliers under this subparagraph (H).  

(I) The Agency shall design its long-term renewable energy procurement plan to maximize the State's interest in the health, safety, and welfare of its residents, including but not limited to minimizing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter and other pollution that adversely affects public health in this State, increasing fuel and resource diversity in this State, enhancing the reliability and resiliency of the electricity distribution system in this State, meeting goals to limit carbon dioxide emissions under federal or State law, and contributing to a cleaner and healthier environment for the citizens of this State. In order to further these legislative purposes, renewable energy credits shall be eligible to be counted toward the renewable energy requirements of this subsection (c) if they are generated from facilities located in this State. The Agency may qualify renewable energy credits from facilities located in states adjacent to Illinois or renewable energy credits associated with the electricity generated by a utility-scale wind energy facility or utility-scale photovoltaic facility and transmitted by a qualifying direct current project described in subsection (b-5) of Section 8-406 of the Public Utilities Act to a delivery point on the electric transmission grid located in this State or a state adjacent to Illinois, if the generator demonstrates and the Agency determines that the operation of such facility or facilities will help promote the State's interest in the health, safety, and welfare of its residents based on the public interest criteria described above. For the purposes of this Section, renewable resources that are delivered via a high voltage direct current converter station located in Illinois shall be deemed generated in Illinois at the time and location the energy is converted to alternating current by the high voltage direct current converter station if the high voltage direct current transmission line: (i) after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, was constructed with a project labor agreement; (ii) is capable of transmitting electricity at 525kv; (iii) has an Illinois converter station located and interconnected in the region of the PJM Interconnection, LLC; (iv) does not operate as a public utility; and (v) if the high voltage direct current transmission line was energized after June 1, 2023. To ensure that the public interest criteria are applied to the procurement and given full effect, the Agency's long-term procurement plan shall describe in detail how each public interest factor shall be considered and weighted for facilities located in states adjacent to Illinois.  

(J) In order to promote the competitive development of renewable energy resources in furtherance of the State's interest in the health, safety, and welfare of its residents, renewable energy credits shall not be eligible to be counted toward the renewable energy requirements of this subsection (c) if they are sourced from a generating unit whose costs were being recovered through rates regulated by this State or any other state or states on or after January 1, 2017. Each contract executed to purchase renewable energy credits under this subsection (c) shall provide for the contract's termination if the costs of the generating unit supplying the renewable energy credits subsequently begin to be recovered through rates regulated by this State or any other state or states; and each contract shall further provide that, in that event, the supplier of the credits must return $110\%$ of all payments received under the contract. Amounts returned under the requirements of this subparagraph (J) shall be retained by the utility and all of these amounts shall be used for the procurement of additional renewable energy credits from new wind or new photovoltaic resources as defined in this subsection (c). The long-term plan shall provide that these renewable energy credits shall be procured in the next procurement event.  

Notwithstanding the limitations of this subparagraph (J), renewable energy credits sourced from generating units that are constructed, purchased, owned, or leased by an electric utility as part of an approved project, program, or pilot under Section 1-56 of this Act shall be eligible to be counted toward the renewable energy requirements of this subsection (c), regardless of how the costs of these units are recovered. As long as a generating unit or an identifiable portion of a generating unit has not had and does not have its costs recovered through rates regulated by this State or any other state, HVDC renewable energy credits associated with that generating unit or identifiable portion thereof shall be eligible to be counted toward the renewable energy requirements of this subsection (c).  

(K) The long-term renewable resources procurement plan developed by the Agency in accordance with subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (1) shall include an Adjustable Block program for the procurement of renewable energy credits from new photovoltaic projects that are distributed renewable energy generation devices or new photovoltaic community renewable generation projects. The Adjustable Block program shall be generally designed to provide for the steady, predictable, and sustainable growth of new solar photovoltaic development in Illinois. To this end, the Adjustable Block program shall provide a transparent annual schedule of prices and quantities to enable the photovoltaic market to scale up and for renewable energy credit prices to adjust at a predictable rate over time. The prices set by the Adjustable Block program can be reflected as a set value or as the product of a formula.  

The Adjustable Block program shall include for each category of eligible projects for each delivery year: a single block of nameplate capacity, a price for renewable energy credits within that block, and the terms and conditions for securing a spot on a waitlist once the block is : a schedule of standard block purchase prices to be offered; a series of steps, with associated nameplate capacity and purchase prices that adjust from step to step; and automatic opening of the next step as soon as the nameplate capacity and available purchase prices for an open step are fully committed or reserved. Except as outlined below, the waitlist of projects in a given year will carry over to apply to the subsequent year when another block is opened. Only projects energized on or after June 1, 2017 shall be eligible for the Adjustable Block program. For each category for each delivery year block group the Agency shall determine the number of blocks, the amount of generation capacity in each block, and the purchase price for each block, provided that the purchase price provided and the total amount of generation in all blocks for all categories block groups shall be sufficient to meet the goals in this subsection (c). The Agency shall strive to issue a single block sized to provide for stability and market growth. The Agency shall establish program eligibility requirements that ensure that projects that enter the program are sufficiently mature to indicate a demonstrable path to completion. The Agency may periodically review its prior decisions establishing the number of blocks, the amount of generation capacity in each block, and the purchase price for each block, and may propose, on an expedited basis, changes to these previously set values, including but not limited to redistributing these amounts and the available funds as necessary and appropriate, subject to Commission approval as part of the periodic plan revision process described in Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. The Agency may define different block sizes, purchase prices, or other distinct terms and conditions for projects located in different utility service territories if the Agency deems it necessary to meet the goals in this subsection (c).  

The Adjustable Block program shall include at least the following categories block groups in at least the following amounts, which may be adjusted upon review by the Agency and approval by the Commission as described in this subparagraph (K):  

(i) At least 20% 25% from distributed renewable energy generation devices with a nameplate capacity of no more than 25 10 kilowatts.  

(ii) At least 20% 25% from distributed renewable energy generation devices with a nameplate capacity of more than 25 10 kilowatts and no more than 5,000 2,000 kilowatts. The Agency may create sub-categories within this category to account for the differences between projects for small commercial customers, large commercial customers, and public or non-profit customers.  

(iii) At least 30% 25% from photovoltaic community renewable generation projects. Capacity for this category for the first 2 delivery years after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly shall be allocated to waitlist projects as provided in paragraph (3) of item (iv) of subparagraph (G). Starting in the third delivery year after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly or earlier if the Agency determines there is additional capacity needed for to meet previous delivery year requirements, the following shall apply:  

(1) the Agency shall select projects on a   
first-come, first-serve basis, however the Agency   
may suggest additional methods to prioritize   
projects that are submitted at the same time; (2) projects shall have subscriptions of 25 kW   
or less for at least 50% of the facility's  

nameplate capacity and the Agency shall price the renewable energy credits with that as a factor; (3) projects shall not be colocated with one or more other community renewable generation projects, as defined in the Agency's first revised long-term renewable resources procurement plan approved by the Commission on February 18, 2020, such that the aggregate nameplate capacity exceeds 5,000 kilowatts; and  

(4) projects greater than 2 MW may not apply until after the approval of the Agency's revised Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly.  

(iv) At least 15% from distributed renewable generation devices or photovoltaic community renewable generation projects installed at public schools. The Agency may create subcategories within this category to account for the differences between project size or location. Projects located within environmental justice communities or within Organizational Units that fall within Tier 1 or Tier 2 shall be given priority. Each of the Agency's periodic updates to its long-term renewable resources procurement plan to incorporate the procurement described in this subparagraph (iv) shall also include the proposed quantities or blocks, pricing, and contract terms applicable to the procurement as indicated herein. In each such update and procurement, the Agency shall set the renewable energy credit price and establish payment terms for the renewable energy credits procured pursuant to this subparagraph (iv) that make it feasible and affordable for public schools to install photovoltaic distributed renewable energy devices on their premises, including, but not limited to, those public schools subject to the prioritization provisions of this subparagraph. For the purposes of this item (iv):  

"Environmental Justice Community" shall have the   
same meaning set forth in the Agency's long-term   
renewable resources procurement plan; "Organization Unit", "Tier 1" and "Tier 2" shall the meanings set for in Section 18-8.15 of the   
School Code; "Public schools" shall have the meaning set forth   
in Section 1-3 of the School Code. (v) At least 5% from community-driven community   
solar projects intended to provide more direct and   
tangible connection and benefits to the communities   
which they serve or in which they operate and,   
additionally, to increase the variety of community   
solar locations, models, and options in Illinois. As  

part of its long-term renewable resources procurement plan, the Agency shall develop selection criteria for projects participating in this category. Nothing in this Section shall preclude the Agency from creating a selection process that maximizes community ownership and community benefits in selecting projects to receive renewable energy credits. Selection criteria shall include:  

(1) community ownership or community wealth-building;  

(2) additional direct and indirect community benefit, beyond project participation as a subscriber, including, but not limited to, economic, environmental, social, cultural, and physical benefits;  

(3) meaningful involvement in project organization and development by community members or nonprofit organizations or public entities located in or serving the community;  

(4) engagement in project operations and management by nonprofit organizations, public entities, or community members; and  

(5) whether a project is developed in response to a site-specific RFP developed by community members or a nonprofit organization or public entity located in or serving the community.  

Selection criteria may also prioritize projects that:  

(1) are developed in collaboration with or to provide complementary opportunities for the Clean Jobs Workforce Network Program, the Illinois Climate Works Preapprenticeship Program, the Returning Residents Clean Jobs Training Program, the Clean Energy Contractor Incubator Program, or the Clean Energy Primes Contractor Accelerator Program;  

(2) increase the diversity of locations of   
community solar projects in Illinois, including by   
locating in urban areas and population centers; (3) are located in Equity Investment Eligible   
Communities; (4) are not greenfield projects; (5) serve only local subscribers; (6) have a nameplate capacity that does not   
exceed 500 kW; (7) are developed by an equity eligible   
contractor; or (8) otherwise meaningfully advance the goals   
of providing more direct and tangible connection   
and benefits to the communities which they serve   
or in which they operate and increasing the   
variety of community solar locations, models, and  

options in Illinois.  

For the purposes of this item (v):  

"Community" means a social unit in which people come together regularly to effect change; a social unit in which participants are marked by a cooperative spirit, a common purpose, or shared interests or characteristics; or a space understood by its residents to be delineated through geographic boundaries or landmarks.  

"Community benefit" means a range of services and activities that provide affirmative, economic, environmental, social, cultural, or physical value to a community; or a mechanism that enables economic development, high-quality employment, and education opportunities for local workers and residents, or formal monitoring and oversight structures such that community members may ensure that those services and activities respond to local knowledge and needs.  

"Community ownership" means an arrangement in which an electric generating facility is, or over time will be, in significant part, owned collectively by members of the community to which an electric generating facility provides benefits; members of that community participate in decisions regarding the governance, operation, maintenance, and upgrades of and to that facility; and members of that community benefit from regular use of that facility.  

Terms and guidance within these criteria that are not defined in this item (v) shall be defined by the Agency, with stakeholder input, during the development of the Agency's long-term renewable resources procurement plan. The Agency shall develop regular opportunities for projects to submit applications for projects under this category, and develop selection criteria that gives preference to projects that better meet individual criteria as well as projects that address a higher number of criteria.  

(vi) At least 10% from distributed renewable energy generation devices, which includes distributed renewable energy devices with a nameplate capacity under 5,000 kilowatts or photovoltaic community renewable generation projects, from applicants that are equity eligible contractors. The Agency may create subcategories within this category to account for the differences between project size and type. The Agency shall propose to increase the percentage in this item (vi) over time to 40% based on factors, including, but not limited to, the number of equity eligible contractors and capacity used in this item (vi) in previous delivery years.  

The Agency shall propose a payment structure for contracts executed pursuant to this paragraph under which, upon a demonstration of qualification or need, applicant firms are advanced capital disbursed after contract execution but before the contracted project's energization. The amount or percentage of capital advanced prior to project energization shall be sufficient to both cover any increase in development costs resulting from prevailing wage requirements or project-labor agreements, and designed to overcome barriers in access to capital faced by equity eligible contractors. The amount or percentage of advanced capital may vary by subcategory within this category and by an applicant's demonstration of need, with such levels to be established through the Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan authorized under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of this Section.  

Contracts developed featuring capital advanced prior to a project's energization shall feature provisions to ensure both the successful development of applicant projects and the delivery of the renewable energy credits for the full term of the contract, including ongoing collateral requirements and other provisions deemed necessary by the Agency, and may include energization timelines longer than for comparable project types. The percentage or amount of capital advanced prior to project energization shall not operate to increase the overall contract value, however contracts executed under this subparagraph may feature renewable energy credit prices higher than those offered to similar projects participating in other categories. Capital advanced prior to energization shall serve to reduce the ratable payments made after energization under items (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (L) or payments made for each renewable energy credit delivery under item (iv) of subparagraph (L).  

(vii) (iv) The remaining capacity 25% shall be allocated as specified by the Agency in order to respond to market demand the long-term renewable resources procurement plan. The Agency shall allocate any discretionary capacity prior to the beginning of each delivery year.  

To the extent there is uncontracted capacity from any block in any of categories (i) through (vi) at the end of a delivery year, the Agency shall redistribute that capacity to one or more other categories giving priority to categories with projects on a waitlist. The redistributed capacity shall be added to the annual capacity in the subsequent delivery year, and the price for renewable energy credits shall be the price for the new delivery year. Redistributed capacity shall not be considered redistributed when determining whether the goals in this  

subsection (K) have been met.  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, as the Agency increases the capacity in item (vi) to 40% over time, the Agency may reduce the capacity of items (i) through (v) proportionate to the capacity of the categories of projects in item (vi), to achieve a balance of project types.  

The Adjustable Block program shall be designed to ensure that renewable energy credits are procured from photovoltaic distributed renewable energy generation devices and new photovoltaic community renewable energy generation projects in diverse locations and are not concentrated in a few regional geographic areas.  

(L) Notwithstanding provisions for advancing capital prior to project energization found in item (vi) of subparagraph (K), the The procurement of photovoltaic renewable energy credits under items (i) through (vi) (iv) of subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1) shall otherwise be subject to the following contract and payment terms:  

(i) (Blank). The Agency shall procure contracts of at least 15 years in length.  

(ii) For those renewable energy credits that qualify and are procured under item (i) of subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1), and any similar category projects that are procured under item (vi) of subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1) that qualify and are procured under item (vi), the contract length shall be 15 years. The renewable energy credit delivery contract value purchase price shall be paid in full, based on the estimated generation during the first 15 years of operation, by the contracting utilities at the time that the facility producing the renewable energy credits is interconnected at the distribution system level of the utility and verified as energized and compliant by the Program Administrator energized. The electric utility shall receive and retire all renewable energy credits generated by the project for the first 15 years of operation. Renewable energy credits generated by the project thereafter shall not be transferred under the renewable energy credit delivery contract with the counterparty electric utility.  

(iii) For those renewable energy credits that qualify and are procured under item (ii) and (v) (iii) of subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1) and any like projects similar category that qualify and are procured under item (vi), the contract length shall be 15 years. 15% any additional categories of distributed generation included in the long-term renewable resources procurement plan and approved by the Commission, 20 percent of the renewable energy credit delivery contract value, based on the estimated generation during the first 15 years of operation, purchase price shall be paid by the contracting utilities at the time that the facility producing the renewable energy credits is interconnected at the distribution system level of the utility and verified as energized and compliant by the Program Administrator. The remaining portion shall be paid ratably over the subsequent 6-year 4-year period. The electric utility shall receive and retire all renewable energy credits generated by the project for the first 15 years of operation. Renewable energy credits generated by the project thereafter shall not be transferred under the renewable energy credit delivery contract with the counterparty electric utility.  

(iv) For those renewable energy credits that qualify and are procured under items (iii) and (iv) of subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1), and any like projects that qualify and are procured under item (vi), the renewable energy credit delivery contract length shall be 20 years and shall be paid over the delivery term, not to exceed during each delivery year the contract price multiplied by the estimated annual renewable energy credit generation amount. If generation of renewable energy credits during a delivery year exceeds the estimated annual generation amount, the excess renewable energy credits shall be carried forward to future delivery years and shall not expire during the delivery term. If generation of renewable energy credits during a delivery year, including carried forward excess renewable energy credits, if any, is less than the estimated annual generation amount, payments during such delivery year will not exceed the quantity generated plus the quantity carried forward multiplied by the contract price. The electric utility shall receive all renewable energy credits generated by the project during the first 20 years of operation and retire all renewable energy credits paid for under this item (iv) and return at the end of the delivery term all renewable energy credits that were not paid for. Renewable energy credits generated by the project thereafter shall not be transferred under the renewable energy credit delivery contract with the counterparty electric utility. Notwithstanding the preceding, for those projects participating under item (iii) of subparagraph (K), the contract price for a delivery year shall be based on subscription levels as measured on the higher of the first business day of the delivery year or the first business day 6 months after the first business day of the delivery year. Subscription of 90% of nameplate capacity or greater shall be deemed to be fully subscribed for the purposes of this item (iv). For projects receiving a 20-year delivery contract, REC prices shall be adjusted downward for consistency with the incentive levels previously determined to be necessary to support projects under 15-year delivery contracts, taking into consideration any additional new requirements placed on the projects, including, but not limited to, labor standards.  

(v) (iv) Each contract shall include provisions to ensure the delivery of the estimated quantity of renewable energy credits and ongoing collateral requirements and other provisions deemed appropriate by the Agency for the full term of the contract.  

(vi) (v) The utility shall be the counterparty to the contracts executed under this subparagraph (L) that are approved by the Commission under the process described in Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. No contract shall be executed for an amount that is less than one renewable energy credit per year.  

(vii) (vi) If, at any time, approved applications for the Adjustable Block program exceed funds collected by the electric utility or would cause the Agency to exceed the limitation described in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (1) on the amount of renewable energy resources that may be procured, then the Agency may shall consider future uncommitted funds to be reserved for these contracts on a first-come, first-served basis, with the delivery of renewable energy credits required beginning at the time that the reserved funds become available.  

(viii) (vii) Nothing in this Section shall require the utility to advance any payment or pay any amounts that exceed the actual amount of revenues anticipated to be collected by the utility under paragraph (6) of this subsection (c) and subsection (k) of Section 16-108 of the Public Utilities Act inclusive of eligible funds collected in prior years and alternative compliance payments for use by the utility, and contracts executed under this Section shall expressly incorporate this limitation.  

(ix) Notwithstanding other requirements of this subparagraph (L), no modification shall be required to Adjustable Block program contracts if they were already executed prior to the establishment, approval, and implementation of new contract forms as a result of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly. (x) Contracts may be assignable, but only to entities first deemed by the Agency to have met program terms and requirements applicable to direct program participation. In developing contracts for the delivery of renewable energy credits, the Agency shall  

be permitted to establish fees applicable to each contract assignment.  

(M) The Agency shall be authorized to retain one or more experts or expert consulting firms to develop, administer, implement, operate, and evaluate the Adjustable Block program described in subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1), and the Agency shall retain the consultant or consultants in the same manner, to the extent practicable, as the Agency retains others to administer provisions of this Act, including, but not limited to, the procurement administrator. The selection of experts and expert consulting firms and the procurement process described in this subparagraph (M) are exempt from the requirements of Section 20-10 of the Illinois Procurement Code, under Section 20-10 of that Code. The Agency shall strive to minimize administrative expenses in the implementation of the Adjustable Block program.  

The Program Administrator may charge application fees to participating firms to cover the cost of program administration. Any application fee amounts shall initially be determined through the long-term renewable resources procurement plan, and modifications to any application fee that deviate more than 25% from the Commission's approved value must be approved by the Commission as a long-term plan revision under Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. The Agency shall consider stakeholder feedback when making adjustments to application fees and shall notify stakeholders in advance of any planned changes.  

In addition to covering the costs of program administration, the Agency, in conjunction with its Program Administrator, may also use the proceeds of such fees charged to participating firms to support public education and ongoing regional and national coordination with nonprofit organizations, public bodies, and others engaged in the implementation of renewable energy incentive programs or similar initiatives. This work may include developing papers and reports, hosting regional and national conferences, and other work deemed necessary by the Agency to position the State of Illinois as a national leader in renewable energy incentive program development and administration.  

The Agency and its consultant or consultants shall monitor block activity, share program activity with stakeholders and conduct quarterly regularly scheduled meetings to discuss program activity and market conditions. If necessary, the Agency may make prospective administrative adjustments to the Adjustable Block program design, such as redistributing available funds or making adjustments to purchase prices as necessary to achieve the goals of this subsection (c). Program modifications to any block price, capacity block, or other program element that do not deviate from the Commission's approved value by more than 10% 25% shall take effect immediately and are not subject to Commission review and approval. Program modifications to any block price, capacity block, or other program element that deviate more than 10% 25% from the Commission's approved value must be approved by the Commission as a long-term plan amendment under Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. The Agency shall consider stakeholder feedback when making adjustments to the Adjustable Block design and shall notify stakeholders in advance of any planned changes.  

The Agency and its program administrators for both the Adjustable Block program and the Illinois Solar for All Program, consistent with the requirements of this subsection (c) and subsection (b) of Section 1-56 of this Act, shall propose the Adjustable Block program terms, conditions, and requirements, including the prices to be paid for renewable energy credits, where applicable, and requirements applicable to participating entities and project applications, through the development, review, and approval of the Agency's long-term renewable resources procurement plan described in this subsection (c) and paragraph (5) of subsection (b) of Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. Terms, conditions, and requirements for program participation shall include the following: (i) The Agency shall establish a registration  

process for entities seeking to qualify for program-administered incentive funding and establish baseline qualifications for vendor approval. The Agency must maintain a list of approved entities on each program's website, and may revoke a vendor's ability to receive program-administered incentive funding status upon a determination that the vendor failed to comply with contract terms, the law, or other program requirements.  

(ii) The Agency shall establish program requirements and minimum contract terms to ensure projects are properly installed and produce their expected amounts of energy. Program requirements may include on-site inspections and photo documentation of projects under construction. The Agency may require repairs, alterations, or additions to remedy any material deficiencies discovered. Vendors who have a disproportionately high number of deficient systems may lose their eligibility to continue to receive State-administered incentive funding through Agency programs and procurements.  

(iii) To discourage deceptive marketing or other bad faith business practices, the Agency may require direct program participants, including agents operating on their behalf, to provide standardized disclosures to a customer prior to that customer's execution of a contract for the development of a distributed generation system or a subscription to a community solar project.  

(iv) The Agency shall establish one or multiple Consumer Complaints Centers to accept complaints regarding businesses that participate in, or otherwise benefit from, State-administered incentive funding through Agency-administered programs. The Agency shall maintain a public database of complaints with any confidential or particularly sensitive information redacted from public entries.  

(v) Through a filing in the proceeding for the approval of its long-term renewable energy resources procurement plan, the Agency shall provide an annual written report to the Illinois Commerce Commission documenting the frequency and nature of complaints and any enforcement actions taken in response to those complaints.  

(vi) The Agency shall schedule regular meetings with representatives of the Office of the Attorney General, the Illinois Commerce Commission, consumer protection groups, and other interested stakeholders to share relevant information about consumer protection, project compliance, and complaints received.  

(vii) To the extent that complaints received implicate the jurisdiction of the Office of the Attorney General, the Illinois Commerce Commission, or local, State, or federal law enforcement, the Agency shall also refer complaints to those entities as appropriate.  

(N) The long-term renewable resources procurement plan required by this subsection (c) shall include a community renewable generation program. The Agency shall establish the terms, conditions, and program requirements for photovoltaic community renewable generation projects with a goal to expand renewable energy generating facility access to a broader group of energy consumers, to ensure robust participation opportunities for residential and small commercial customers and those who cannot install renewable energy on their own properties. Subject to reasonable limitations, any Any plan approved by the Commission shall allow subscriptions to community renewable generation projects to be portable and transferable. For purposes of this subparagraph (N), "portable" means that subscriptions may be retained by the subscriber even if the subscriber relocates or changes its address within the same utility service territory; and "transferable" means that a subscriber may assign or sell subscriptions to another person within the same utility service territory.  

Through the development of its long-term renewable resources procurement plan, the Agency may consider whether community renewable generation projects utilizing technologies other than photovoltaics should be supported through State-administered incentive funding, and may issue requests for information to gauge market demand.  

Electric utilities shall provide a monetary credit to a subscriber's subsequent bill for service for the proportional output of a community renewable generation project attributable to that subscriber as specified in Section 16-107.5 of the Public Utilities Act.  

The Agency shall purchase renewable energy credits from subscribed shares of photovoltaic community renewable generation projects through the Adjustable Block program described in subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1) or through the Illinois Solar for All Program described in Section 1-56 of this Act. The electric utility shall purchase any unsubscribed energy from community renewable generation projects that are Qualifying Facilities ("QF") under the electric utility's tariff for purchasing the output from QFs under Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.  

The owners of and any subscribers to a community renewable generation project shall not be considered public utilities or alternative retail electricity suppliers under the Public Utilities Act solely as a result of their interest in or subscription to a community renewable generation project and shall not be required to become an alternative retail electric supplier by participating in a community renewable generation project with a public utility.  

(O) For the delivery year beginning June 1, 2018, the long-term renewable resources procurement plan required by this subsection (c) shall provide for the Agency to procure contracts to continue offering the Illinois Solar for All Program described in subsection (b) of Section 1-56 of this Act, and the contracts approved by the Commission shall be executed by the utilities that are subject to this subsection (c). The long-term renewable resources procurement plan shall allocate up to \$50,000,000 5% of the funds available under the plan for the applicable delivery year, or \$10,000,000 per delivery year, whichever is greater, to fund the programs, and the plan shall determine the amount of funding to be apportioned to the programs identified in subsection (b) of Section 1-56 of this Act; provided that for the delivery years beginning June 1, 2021, June 1, 2022, and June 1, 2023, the long-term renewable resources procurement plan may average the annual budgets over a 3-year period to account for program ramp-up. For for the delivery years beginning June 1, 2017, June 1, 2021, and June 1, 2024 2025, June 1, 2027, and June 1, 2030 and additional the long-term renewable resources procurement plan shall allocate 10% of the funds available under the plan for the applicable delivery year, or \$20,000,000 per delivery year, whichever is greater, and \$10,000,000 of such funds in such year shall be provided to the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to implement the workforce development programs and reporting as outlined in used by an electric utility that serves more than 3,000,000 retail customers in the State to implement IaT Commission-approved plan under Section 16-108.12 of the Public Utilities Act. In making the determinations required under this subparagraph (O), the Commission shall consider the experience and performance under the programs and any evaluation reports. The Commission shall also provide for an independent evaluation of those programs on a periodic basis that are funded under this subparagraph (O).  

(P) All programs and procurements under this subsection (c) shall be designed to encourage participating projects to use a diverse and equitable workforce and a diverse set of contractors, including minority-owned businesses, disadvantaged businesses, trade unions, graduates of any workforce training programs administered under this Act, and small businesses.  

The Agency shall develop a method to optimize procurement of renewable energy credits from proposed utility-scale projects that are located in communities eligible to receive Energy Transition Community Grants pursuant to Section 10-20 of the Energy Community Reinvestment Act. If this requirement conflicts with other provisions of law or the Agency determines that full compliance with the requirements of this subparagraph (P) would be unreasonably costly or administratively impractical, the Agency is to propose alternative approaches to achieve development of renewable energy resources in communities eligible to receive Energy Transition Community Grants pursuant to Section 10-20 of the Energy Community Reinvestment Act or seek an exemption from this requirement from the Commission.  

(Q) Each facility listed in subitems (i) through (viii) of item (1) of this subparagraph (Q) for which a renewable energy credit delivery contract is signed after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly is subject to the following requirements through the Agency's long-term renewable resources procurement plan:  

(1) Each facility shall be subject to the prevailing wage requirements included in the Prevailing Wage Act. The Agency shall require verification that all construction performed on the facility by the renewable energy credit delivery contract holder, its contractors, or its subcontractors relating to construction of the facility is performed by construction employees eceiving an amount for that work equal to or greater han the general prevailing rate, as that term is efined in Section 3 of the Prevailing Wage Act. For urposes of this item (1), "house of worship" means roperty that is both (1) used exclusively by a eligious society or body of persons as a place for eligious exercise or religious worship and (2) ecognized as exempt from taxation pursuant to Section 5-40 of the Property Tax Code.

(2) Renewable energy credits procured from new utility-scale wind projects, new utility-scale solar projects, and new brownfield solar projects pursuant to Agency procurement events occurring after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly must be from facilities built by general contractors that must enter into a project labor agreement, as defined by this Act, prior to construction. The project labor agreement shall be filed with the Director in accordance with procedures established by the Agency through its long-term renewable resources procurement plan. Any information submitted to the Agency in this item (2) shall be considered commercially sensitive information. At a minimum, the project labor agreement must provide the names, addresses, and occupations of the owner of the plant and the individuals representing the labor organization employees participating in the project labor agreement consistent with the Project Labor Agreements Act. The agreement must also specify the terms and conditions as defined by this Act.  

(3) It is the intent of this Section to ensure that economic development occurs across Illinois communities, that emerging businesses may grow, and that there is improved access to the clean energy economy by persons who have greater economic burdens to success. The Agency shall take into consideration the unique cost of compliance of this subparagraph (Q) that might be borne by equity eligible contractors, shall include such costs when determining the price of renewable energy credits in the Adjustable Block program, and shall take such costs into consideration in a nondiscriminatory manner when comparing bids for competitive procurements. The Agency shall consider costs associated with compliance whether in the development, financing, or construction of projects.  

The Agency shall periodically review the assumptions in these costs and may adjust prices, in compliance with subparagraph (M) of this paragraph (1).  

(R) In its long-term renewable resources procurement plan, the Agency shall establish a self-direct renewable portfolio standard compliance program for eligible self-direct customers that purchase renewable energy credits from utility-scale wind and solar projects through long-term agreements for purchase of renewable energy credits as described in this Section. Such long-term agreements may include the purchase of energy or other products on a physical or financial basis and may involve an alternative retail electric supplier as defined in Section 16-102 of the Public Utilities Act. This program shall take effect in the delivery year commencing June 1, 2023.  

(1) For the purposes of this subparagraph:  

"Eligible self-direct customer" means any retail customers of an electric utility that serves 3,000,000 or more retail customers in the State and whose total highest 30-minute demand was more than 10,000 kilowatts, or any retail customers of an electric utility that serves less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State and whose total highest 15-minute demand was more than 10,000 kilowatts.  

LRB102 11366 BMS 16699 b "Retail customer" has the meaning set forth in   
Section 16-102 of the Public Utilities Act and ultiple retail customer accounts under the same orporate parent may aggregate their account demands o meet the 10,000 kilowatt threshold. The criteria   
for determining whether this subparagraph is pplicable to a retail customer shall be based on the 2 consecutive billing periods prior to the start of he year in which the application is filed. (2) For renewable energy credits to count toward   
the self-direct renewable portfolio standard ompliance program, they must: (i) qualify as renewable energy credits as defined in Section 1-10 of this Act; (ii) be sourced from one or more renewable energy generating facilities that comply with the geographic requirements as set forth in subparagraph (I) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) as interpreted through the Agency's long-term renewable resources procurement plan, or, where applicable, the geographic requirements that governed utility-scale renewable energy credits at the time the eligible self-direct customer entered into the applicable renewable energy credit purchase agreement; (iii) be procured through long-term contracts with term lengths of at least 10 years either directly with the renewable energy generating facility or through a bundled power purchase agreement, a virtual power purchase agreement, an agreement between the renewable generating facility, an alternative retail electric supplier, and the customer, or such other structure as is permissible under this subparagraph (R);   
(iv) be equivalent in volume to at least 40% of the eligible self-direct customer's usage, determined annually by the eligible self-direct customer's usage during the previous delivery year, measured to the nearest megawatt-hour;   
(v) be retired by or on behalf of the large energy customer;   
(vi) be sourced from new utility-scale wind projects or new utility-scale solar projects; and (vii) if the contracts for renewable energy credits are entered into after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, the new utility-scale wind projects or new utility-scale solar projects must comply with the requirements established in subparagraphs (P) and (Q) of paragraph (1) of this subsection (c) and subsection (c-10).   
(3) The self-direct renewable portfolio standard  

compliance program shall be designed to allow eligible self-direct customers to procure new renewable energy credits from new utility-scale wind projects or new utility-scale photovoltaic projects. The Agency shall annually determine the amount of utility-scale renewable energy credits it will include each year from the self-direct renewable portfolio standard compliance program, subject to receiving qualifying applications. In making this determination, the Agency shall evaluate publicly available analyses and studies of the potential market size for utility-scale renewable energy long-term purchase agreements by commercial and industrial energy customers and make that report publicly available. If demand for participation in the self-direct renewable portfolio standard compliance program exceeds availability, the Agency shall ensure participation is evenly split between commercial and industrial users to the extent there is sufficient demand from both customer classes. Each renewable energy credit procured pursuant to this subparagraph (R) by a self-direct customer shall reduce the total volume of renewable energy credits the Agency is otherwise required to procure from new utility-scale projects pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) of this subsection (c) on behalf of contracting utilities where the eligible self-direct customer is located. The self-direct customer shall file an annual compliance report with the Agency pursuant to terms established by the Agency through its long-term renewable resources procurement plan to be eligible for participation in this program. Customers must provide the Agency with their most recent electricity billing statements or other information deemed necessary by the Agency to demonstrate they are an eligible self-direct customer. (4) The Commission shall approve a reduction in the volumetric charges collected pursuant to Section 16-108 of the Public Utilities Act for approved eligible self-direct customers equivalent to the anticipated cost of renewable energy credit deliveries under contracts for new utility-scale wind and new utility-scale solar entered for each delivery year after the large energy customer begins retiring eligible new utility scale renewable energy credits for self-compliance. The self-direct credit amount shall be determined annually and is equal to the estimated portion of the cost authorized by subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) of this subsection (c) that supported the annual procurement of utility-scale renewable energy credits in the prior delivery year using a methodology described in the long-term renewable resources procurement plan, expressed on a per kilowatthour basis, and does not include (i) costs associated with any contracts entered into before the delivery year in which the customer files the initial compliance report to be eligible for participation in the self-direct program, and (ii) costs associated with procuring renewable energy credits through existing and future contracts through the Adjustable Block Program, subsection (c-5) of this Section 1-75, and the Solar for All Program. The Agency shall assist the Commission in determining the current and future costs. The Agency must determine the self-direct credit amount for new and existing eligible self-direct customers and submit this to the Commission in an annual compliance filing. The Commission must approve the self-direct credit amount by June 1, 2023 and June 1 of each delivery year thereafter.  

(5) Customers described in this subparagraph (R) shall apply, on a form developed by the Agency, to the Agency to be designated as a self-direct eligible customer. Once the Agency determines that a self-direct customer is eligible for participation in the program, the self-direct customer will remain eligible until the end of the term of the contract. Thereafter, application may be made not less than 12 months before the filing date of the long-term  

Public Act 102-0662 LRB102 11366 BMS 16699 b newable resources procurement plan described in this Act. At a minimum, such application shall contain the following: (i) the customer's certification that, at the time of the customer's application, the customer qualifies to be a self-direct eligible customer, including documents demonstrating that qualification; (ii) the customer's certification that the customer has entered into or will enter into by the beginning of the applicable procurement year, one or more bilateral contracts for new wind projects or new photovoltaic projects, including supporting documentation; (iii) certification that the contract or contracts for new renewable energy resources are long-term contracts with term lengths of at least 10 years, including supporting documentation; (iv) certification of the quantities of renewable energy credits that the customer will purchase each year under such contract or contracts, including supporting documentation; (v) proof that the contract is sufficient to produce renewable energy credits to be equivalent in volume to at least 40% of the large energy customer's usage from the previous delivery year, measured to the nearest megawatt-hour; and (vi) certification that the customer intends to maintain the contract for the duration of the length of the contract.  

(6) If a customer receives the self-direct credit but fails to properly procure and retire renewable energy credits as required under this subparagraph (R), the Commission, on petition from the Agency and after notice and hearing, may direct such customer's utility to recover the cost of the wrongfully received self-direct credits plus interest through an adder to charges assessed pursuant to Section 16-108 of the Public Utilities Act. Self-direct customers who knowingly fail to properly procure and retire renewable energy credits and do not notify the Agency are ineligible for continued participation in the self-direct renewable portfolio standard compliance program.  

(2) (Blank).  

(3) (Blank).  

(4) The electric utility shall retire all renewable energy credits used to comply with the standard.  

(5) Beginning with the 2010 delivery year and ending June 1, 2017, an electric utility subject to this subsection (c) shall apply the lesser of the maximum alternative compliance payment rate or the most recent estimated alternative compliance payment rate for its service territory for the corresponding compliance period, established pursuant to subsection (d) of Section 16-115D of the Public Utilities Act to its retail customers that take service pursuant to the electric utility's hourly pricing tariff or tariffs. The electric utility shall retain all amounts collected as a result of the application of the alternative compliance payment rate or rates to such customers, and, beginning in 2011, the utility shall include in the information provided under item (1) of subsection (d) of Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act the amounts collected under the alternative compliance payment rate or rates for the prior year ending May 31. Notwithstanding any limitation on the procurement of renewable energy resources imposed by item (2) of this subsection (c), the Agency shall increase its spending on the purchase of renewable energy resources to be procured by the electric utility for the next plan year by an amount equal to the amounts collected by the utility under the alternative compliance payment rate or rates in the prior year ending May 31.  

(6) The electric utility shall be entitled to recover all of its costs associated with the procurement of renewable energy credits under plans approved under this Section and Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. These costs shall include associated reasonable expenses for implementing the procurement programs, including, but not limited to, the costs of administering and evaluating the Adjustable Block program, through an automatic adjustment clause tariff in accordance with subsection (k) of Section 16-108 of the Public Utilities Act.  

(7) Renewable energy credits procured from new photovoltaic projects or new distributed renewable energy generation devices under this Section after June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906) must be procured from devices installed by a qualified person in compliance with the requirements of Section 16-128A of the Public Utilities Act and any rules or regulations adopted thereunder.  

In meeting the renewable energy requirements of this subsection (c), to the extent feasible and consistent with State and federal law, the renewable energy credit procurements, Adjustable Block solar program, and community renewable generation program shall provide employment opportunities for all segments of the population and workforce, including minority-owned and female-owned business enterprises, and shall not, consistent with State and federal law, discriminate based on race or socioeconomic status.

In the second procurement event, the Agency shall select applicants and new renewable energy facilities to supply renewable energy credits, at a price of \$30 per renewable energy credit, aggregating to no more than 625,000 renewable energy credits per year less the amount of renewable energy credits each year contracted for as a result of the first procurement event, for the applicable durations. The number of renewable energy credits to be procured as specified in this paragraph (5) shall not be reduced based on renewable energy credits procured in the self-direct renewable energy credit compliance program established pursuant to subparagraph (R) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75.  

(6) The obligation to purchase renewable energy credits from the applicants and their new renewable energy facilities selected by the Agency shall be allocated to the electric utilities based on their respective percentages of kilowatthours delivered to delivery services customers to the aggregate kilowatthour deliveries by the electric utilities to delivery services customers for the year ended December 31, 2021. In order to achieve these allocation percentages between or among the electric utilities, the Agency shall require each applicant that is selected in the procurement event to enter into a contract with each electric utility for the sale and purchase of renewable energy credits from each new renewable energy facility to be constructed and operated by the applicant, with the sale and purchase obligations under the contracts to aggregate to the total number of renewable energy credits per year to be supplied by the applicant from the new renewable energy facility.  

(7) The Agency shall submit its proposed selection of applicants, new renewable energy facilities to be constructed, and renewable energy credit amounts for each procurement event to the Commission for approval. The  

Commission shall, within 2 business days after receipt of the Agency's proposed selections, approve the proposed selections if it determines that the applicants and the new renewable energy facilities to be constructed meet the selection criteria set forth in this subsection (c-5) and that the Agency seeks approval for contracts of applicable durations aggregating to no more than the maximum amount of renewable energy credits per year authorized by this subsection (c-5) for the procurement event, at a price of \$30 per renewable energy credit.  

(8) The Agency, in conjunction with its procurement administrator if one is retained, the electric utilities, and potential applicants for contracts to produce and supply renewable energy credits pursuant to this subsection (c-5), shall develop a standard form contract for the sale, delivery and purchase of renewable energy credits pursuant to this subsection (c-5). Each contract resulting from the first procurement event shall allow for a commercial operation date for the new renewable energy facility of either June 1, 2023 or June 1, 2024, with such dates subject to adjustment as provided in this paragraph. Each contract resulting from the second procurement event shall provide for a commercial operation date on June 1 next occurring up to 48 months after execution of the contract. Each contract shall provide that the owner shall receive payments for renewable energy credits for the applicable durations beginning with the commercial operation date of the new renewable energy facility. The form contract shall provide for adjustments to the commercial operation and payment start dates as needed due to any delays in completing the procurement and contracting processes, in finalizing interconnection agreements and installing interconnection facilities, and in obtaining other necessary governmental permits and approvals. The form contract shall be, to the maximum extent possible, consistent with standard electric industry contracts for sale, delivery, and purchase of renewable energy credits while taking into account the specific requirements of this subsection (c-5). The form contract shall provide for over-delivery and under-delivery of renewable energy credits within reasonable ranges during each 12-month period and penalty, default, and enforcement provisions for failure of the selling party to deliver renewable energy credits as specified in the contract and to comply with the requirements of this subsection (c-5). The standard form contract shall specify that all renewable energy credits delivered to the electric utility pursuant to the contract shall be retired. The Agency shall make the proposed contracts available for a reasonable period for comment by potential applicants, and shall publish the final form contract at least 30 days before the date of the first  

procurement event. (9) Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative

The Treasurer shall accept all written warrants so signed and shall be released from liability for all payments made on those warrants.  

(11) Diversity, equity, and inclusion plans.  

(A) Each applicant selected in a procurement event to contract to supply renewable energy credits in accordance with this subsection (c-5) and each owner selected by the Department to receive a grant or grants to support the construction and operation of a new energy storage facility or facilities in accordance with this subsection (c-5) shall, within 60 days following the Commission's approval of the applicant to contract to supply renewable energy credits or within 60 days following execution of a grant contract with the Department, as applicable, submit to the Commission a diversity, equity, and inclusion plan setting forth the applicant's or owner's numeric goals for the diversity composition of its supplier entities for the new renewable energy facility or new energy storage facility, as applicable, which shall be referred to for purposes of this paragraph (11) as the project, and the applicant's or owner's action plan and schedule for achieving those goals.  

(B) For purposes of this paragraph (11), diversity composition shall be based on the percentage, which shall be a minimum of 25%, of eligible expenditures for contract awards for materials and services (which shall be defined in the plan) to business enterprises owned by minority persons, women, or persons with disabilities as defined in Section 2 of the Business Enterprise for Minorities, Women, and Persons with Disabilities Act, to LGBTQ business enterprises, to veteran-owned business enterprises, and to business enterprises located in environmental justice communities. The diversity composition goals of the plan may include eligible expenditures in areas for vendor or supplier opportunities in addition to development and construction of the project, and may exclude from eligible expenditures materials and services with limited market availability, limited production and availability from suppliers in the United States, such as solar panels and storage batteries, and material and services that are subject to critical energy infrastructure or cybersecurity requirements or restrictions. The plan may provide that the diversity composition goals may be met through Tier 1 Direct or Tier 2 subcontracting expenditures or a combination thereof for the project. (C) The plan shall provide for, but not be limited to: (i) internal initiatives, including multi-tier initiatives, by the applicant or owner, or by its engineering, procurement and construction contractor if one is used for the project, which for purposes of this paragraph (11) shall be referred to as the EPC contractor, to enable diverse businesses to be considered fairly for selection to provide materials and services; (ii) requirements for the applicant or owner or its EPC contractor to proactively solicit and utilize diverse businesses to provide materials and services; and (iii) requirements for the applicant or owner or its EPC contractor to hire a diverse workforce for the project. The plan shall include a description of the applicant's or owner's diversity recruiting efforts both for the project and for other areas of the applicant's or owner's business operations. The plan shall provide for the imposition of financial penalties on the applicant's or owner's EPC contractor for failure to exercise best efforts to comply with and execute the EPC contractor's diversity obligations under the plan. The plan may provide for the applicant or owner to set aside a portion of the work on the project to serve as an incubation program for qualified businesses, as specified in the plan, owned by minority persons, women, persons with disabilities, LGBTQ persons, and veterans, and businesses located in environmental justice communities, seeking to enter the renewable energy industry.  

(D) The applicant or owner may submit a revised or updated plan to the Commission from time to time as circumstances warrant. The applicant or owner shall file annual reports with the Commission detailing the applicant's or owner's progress in implementing its plan and achieving its goals and any modifications the applicant or owner has made to its plan to better achieve its diversity, equity and inclusion goals. The applicant or owner shall file a final report on the fifth June 1 following the commercial operation date of the new renewable energy resource or new energy storage facility, but the applicant or owner shall thereafter continue to be subject to applicable reporting requirements of Section 5-117 of the Public Utilities Act.  

(c-10) Equity accountability system. It is the purpose of this subsection (c-10) to create an equity accountability system, which includes the minimum equity standards for all renewable energy procurements, the equity category of the Adjustable Block Program, and the equity prioritization for noncompetitive procurements, that is successful in advancing priority access to the clean energy economy for businesses and workers from communities that have been excluded from economic opportunities in the energy sector, have been subject to disproportionate levels of pollution, and have disproportionately experienced negative public health outcomes. Further, it is the purpose of this subsection to ensure that this equity accountability system is successful in advancing equity across Illinois by providing access to the clean energy economy for businesses and workers from communities that have been historically excluded from economic opportunities in the energy sector, have been subject to disproportionate levels of pollution, and have disproportionately experienced negative public health outcomes.   
(1) Minimum equity standards. The Agency shall create  

programs with the purpose of increasing access to and development of equity eligible contractors, who are prime contractors and subcontractors, across all of the programs it manages. All applications for renewable energy credit procurements shall comply with specific minimum equity commitments. Starting in the delivery year immediately following the next long-term renewable resources procurement plan, at least 10% of the project workforce for each entity participating in a procurement program outlined in this subsection (c-10) must be done by equity eligible persons or equity eligible contractors. The Agency shall increase the minimum percentage each delivery year thereafter by increments that ensure a statewide average of 30% of the project workforce for each entity participating in a procurement program is done by equity eligible persons or equity eligible contractors by 2030. The Agency shall propose a schedule of percentage increases to the minimum equity standards in its draft revised renewable energy resources procurement plan submitted to the Commission for approval pursuant to paragraph (5) of subsection (b) of Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. In determining these annual increases, the Agency shall have the discretion to establish different minimum equity standards for different types of procurements and different regions of the State if the Agency finds that doing so will further the purposes of this subsection (c-10). The proposed schedule of annual increases shall be revisited and updated on an annual basis. Revisions shall be developed with stakeholder input, including from equity eligible persons, equity eligible contractors, clean energy industry representatives, and community-based organizations that work with such persons and contractors.  

(A) At the start of each delivery year, the Agency shall require a compliance plan from each entity participating in a procurement program of subsection (c) of this Section that demonstrates how they will achieve compliance with the minimum equity standard percentage for work completed in that delivery year. If an entity applies for its approved vendor or designee status between delivery years, the Agency shall require a compliance plan at the time of application.  

(B) Halfway through each delivery year, the Agency shall require each entity participating in a procurement program to confirm that it will achieve compliance in that delivery year, when applicable. The Agency may offer corrective action plans to entities that are not on track to achieve compliance.  

(C) At the end of each delivery year, each entity participating and completing work in that delivery year in a procurement program of subsection (c) shall submit a report to the Agency that demonstrates how it achieved compliance with the minimum equity standards percentage for that delivery year.  

(D) The Agency shall prohibit participation in procurement programs by an approved vendor or designee, as applicable, or entities with which an approved vendor or designee, as applicable, shares a common parent company if an approved vendor or designee, as applicable, failed to meet the minimum equity standards for the prior delivery year. Waivers approved for lack of equity eligible persons or equity eligible contractors in a geographic area of a project shall not count against the approved vendor or designee. The Agency shall offer a corrective action plan for any such entities to assist them in obtaining compliance and shall allow continued access to procurement programs upon an approved vendor or designee demonstrating compliance.  

(E) The Agency shall pursue efficiencies achieved by combining with other approved vendor or designee reporting.  

(2) Equity accountability system within the Adjustable Block program. The equity category described in item (vi) of subparagraph (K) of subsection (c) is only available to applicants that are equity eligible contractors.  

(3) Equity accountability system within competitive procurements. Through its long-term renewable resources procurement plan, the Agency shall develop requirements for ensuring that competitive procurement processes, including utility-scale solar, utility-scale wind, and brownfield site photovoltaic projects, advance the equity goals of this subsection (c-10). Subject to Commission approval, the Agency shall develop bid application requirements and a bid evaluation methodology for ensuring that utilization of equity eligible contractors, whether as bidders or as participants on project development, is optimized, including requiring that winning or successful applicants for utility-scale projects are or will partner with equity eligible contractors and giving preference to bids through which a higher portion of contract value flows to equity eligible contractors. To the extent practicable, entities participating in competitive procurements shall also be required to meet all the equity accountability requirements for approved vendors and their designees under this subsection (c-10). In developing these requirements, the Agency shall also consider whether equity goals can be further advanced through additional measures.  

(4) In the first revision to the long-term renewable   
energy resources procurement plan and each revision   
thereafter, the Agency shall include the following: (A) The current status and number of equity eligible contractors listed in the Energy Workforce  

Equity Database designed in subsection (c-25), including the number of equity eligible contractors with current certifications as issued by the Agency.  

(B) A mechanism for measuring, tracking, and reporting project workforce at the approved vendor or designee level, as applicable, which shall include a measurement methodology and records to be made available for audit by the Agency or the Program Administrator.  

(C) A program for approved vendors, designees, eligible persons, and equity eligible contractors to receive trainings, guidance, and other support from the Agency or its designee regarding the equity category outlined in item (vi) of subparagraph (K) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) and in meeting the minimum equity standards of this subsection (c-10).  

(D) A process for certifying equity eligible contractors and equity eligible persons. The certification process shall coordinate with the Energy Workforce Equity Database set forth in subsection (c-25).  

(E) An application for waiver of the minimum equity standards of this subsection, which the Agency shall have the discretion to grant in rare circumstances. The Agency may grant such a waiver where the applicant provides evidence of significant efforts toward meeting the minimum equity commitment, including: use of the Energy Workforce Equity Database; efforts to hire or contract with entities that hire eligible persons; and efforts to establish contracting relationships with eligible contractors. The Agency shall support applicants in understanding the Energy Workforce Equity Database and other resources for pursuing compliance of the minimum equity standards. Waivers shall be project-specific, unless the Agency deems it necessary to grant a waiver across a portfolio of projects, and in effect for no longer than one year. Any waiver extension or subsequent waiver request from an applicant shall be subject to the requirements of this Section and shall specify efforts made to reach compliance. When considering whether to grant a waiver, and to what extent, the Agency shall consider the degree to which similarly situated applicants have been able to meet these minimum equity commitments. For repeated waiver requests for specific lack of eligible persons or eligible contractors available, the Agency shall make recommendations to target recruitment to add such eligible persons or eligible contractors to the database.  

(5) The Agency shall collect information about work on projects or portfolios of projects subject to these minimum equity standards to ensure compliance with this subsection (c-10). Reporting in furtherance of this requirement may be combined with other annual reporting requirements. Such reporting shall include proof of certification of each equity eligible contractor or equity eligible person during the applicable time period.  

(6) The Agency shall keep confidential all information and communication that provides private or personal information.  

(7) Modifications to the equity accountability system. As part of the update of the long-term renewable resources procurement plan to be initiated in 2023, or sooner if the Agency deems necessary, the Agency shall determine the extent to which the equity accountability system described in this subsection (c-10) has advanced the goals of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, including through the inclusion of equity eligible persons and equity eligible contractors in renewable energy credit projects. If the Agency finds that the equity accountability system has failed to meet those goals to its fullest potential, the Agency may revise the following criteria for future Agency procurements: (A) the percentage of project workforce, or other appropriate workforce measure, certified as equity eligible persons or equity eligible contractors; (B) definitions for equity investment eligible persons and equity investment eligible community; and (C) such other modifications necessary to advance the goals of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly effectively. Such revised criteria may also establish distinct equity accountability systems for different types of procurements or different regions of the State if the Agency finds that doing so will further the purposes of such programs. Revisions shall be developed with stakeholder input, including from equity eligible persons, equity eligible contractors, and community-based organizations that work with such persons and contractors. (c-15) Racial discrimination elimination powers and process.  

(1) Purpose. It is the purpose of this subsection to empower the Agency and other State actors to remedy racial discrimination in Illinois' clean energy economy as effectively and expediently as possible, including through the use of race-conscious remedies, such as race-conscious contracting and hiring goals, as consistent with State and federal law.  

(2) Racial disparity and discrimination review process.  

(A) Within one year after awarding contracts using the equity actions processes established in this Section, the Agency shall publish a report evaluating the effectiveness of the equity actions point criteria of this Section in increasing participation of equity eligible persons and equity eligible contractors. The report shall disaggregate participating workers and contractors by race and ethnicity. The report shall be forwarded to the Governor, the General Assembly, and the Illinois Commerce Commission and be made available to the public.  

(B) As soon as is practicable thereafter, the Agency, in consultation with the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, Department of Labor, and other agencies that may be relevant, shall commission and publish a disparity and availability study that measures the presence and impact of discrimination on minority businesses and workers in Illinois' clean energy economy. The Agency may hire consultants and experts to conduct the disparity and availability study, with the retention of those consultants and experts exempt from the requirements of Section 20-10 of the Illinois Procurement Code. The Illinois Power Agency shall forward a copy of its findings and recommendations to the Governor, the General Assembly, and the Illinois Commerce Commission. If the disparity and availability study establishes a strong basis in evidence that there is discrimination in Illinois' clean energy economy, the Agency, Department of Commerce and Economic  

Opportunity, Department of Labor, Department of Corrections, and other appropriate agencies shall take appropriate remedial actions, including race-conscious remedial actions as consistent with State and federal law, to effectively remedy this discrimination. Such remedies may include modification of the equity accountability system as described in subsection (c-10).  

(c-20) Program data collection.  

(1) Purpose. Data collection, data analysis, and reporting are critical to ensure that the benefits of the clean energy economy provided to Illinois residents and businesses are equitably distributed across the State. The Agency shall collect data from program applicants in order to track and improve equitable distribution of benefits across Illinois communities for all procurements the Agency conducts. The Agency shall use this data to, among other things, measure any potential impact of racial discrimination on the distribution of benefits and provide information necessary to correct any discrimination through methods consistent with State and federal law.  

(2) Agency collection of program data. The Agency shall collect demographic and geographic data for each entity awarded contracts under any Agency-administered program.  

(3) Required information to be collected. The Agency shall collect the following information from applicants nd program participants where applicable: (A) demographic information, including racial or ethnic identity for real persons employed, contracted, or subcontracted through the program and owners of businesses or entities that apply to receive renewable energy credits from the Agency; (B) geographic location of the residency of real persons employed, contracted, or subcontracted through the program and geographic location of the headquarters of the business or entity that applies to receive renewable energy credits from the Agency; and (C) any other information the Agency determines is necessary for the purpose of achieving the purpose of this subsection. (4) Publication of collected information. The Agency hall publish, at least annually, information on the emographics of program participants on an aggregate asis. (5) Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to imit the authority of the Agency, or other agency or epartment of the State, to require or collect demographic nformation from applicants of other State programs. (c-25) Energy Workforce Equity Database. (1) The Agency, in consultation with the Department of ommerce and Economic Opportunity, shall create an Energy  

Workforce Equity Database, and may contract with a third party to do so ("database program administrator"). If the Department decides to contract with a third party, that third party shall be exempt from the requirements of Section 20-10 of the Illinois Procurement Code. The Energy Workforce Equity Database shall be a searchable database of suppliers, vendors, and subcontractors for clean energy industries that is:  

(A) publicly accessible;   
(B) easy for people to find and use;   
(C) organized by company specialty or field; (D) region-specific; and  

(E) populated with information including, but not limited to, contacts for suppliers, vendors, or subcontractors who are minority and women-owned business enterprise certified or who participate or have participated in any of the programs described in this Act.  

(2) The Agency shall create an easily accessible,   
public facing online tool using the database information   
that includes, at a minimum, the following: (A) a map of environmental justice and equity investment eligible communities; (B) job postings and recruiting opportunities; (C) a means by which recruiting clean energy companies can find and interact with current or former  

participants of clean energy workforce training programs;  

(D) information on workforce training service providers and training opportunities available to prospective workers;  

(E) renewable energy company diversity reporting;  

(F) a list of equity eligible contractors with their contact information, types of work performed, and locations worked in;  

(G) reporting on outcomes of the programs described in the workforce programs of the Energy Transition Act, including information such as, but not limited to, retention rate, graduation rate, and placement rates of trainees; and  

(H) information about the Jobs and Environmental Justice Grant Program, the Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund, and other sources of capital.  

(3) The Agency shall ensure the database is regularly updated to ensure information is current and shall coordinate with the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to ensure that it includes information on individuals and entities that are or have participated in the Clean Jobs Workforce Network Program, Clean Energy Contractor Incubator Program, Returning Residents Clean Jobs Training Program, or Clean Energy Primes Contractor Accelerator Program.  

(c-30) Enforcement of minimum equity standards. All entities seeking renewable energy credits must submit an annual report to demonstrate compliance with each of the equity commitments required under subsection (c-10). If the Agency concludes the entity has not met or maintained its minimum equity standards required under the applicable subparagraphs under subsection (c-10), the Agency shall deny the entity's ability to participate in procurement programs in subsection (c), including by withholding approved vendor or designee status. The Agency may require the entity to enter into a corrective action plan. An entity that is not recertified for failing to meet required equity actions in subparagraph (c-10) may reapply once they have a corrective action plan and achieve compliance with the minimum equity standards.  

(d) Clean coal portfolio standard.  

(1) The procurement plans shall include electricity generated using clean coal. Each utility shall enter into one or more sourcing agreements with the initial clean coal facility, as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection (d), covering electricity generated by the initial clean coal facility representing at least $5\%$ of each utility's total supply to serve the load of eligible retail customers in 2015 and each year thereafter, as described in paragraph (3) of this subsection (d), subject to the limits specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection (d). It is the goal of the State that by January 1, 2025, $25\%$ of the electricity used in the State shall be generated by cost-effective clean coal facilities. For purposes of this subsection (d), "cost-effective" means that the expenditures pursuant to such sourcing agreements do not cause the limit stated in paragraph (2) of this subsection (d) to be exceeded and do not exceed cost-based benchmarks, which shall be developed to assess all expenditures pursuant to such sourcing agreements covering electricity generated by clean coal facilities, other than the initial clean coal facility, by the procurement administrator, in consultation with the Commission staff, Agency staff, and the procurement monitor and shall be subject to Commission review and approval.  

A utility party to a sourcing agreement shall immediately retire any emission credits that it receives in connection with the electricity covered by such agreement.  

Utilities shall maintain adequate records documenting the purchases under the sourcing agreement to comply with this subsection (d) and shall file an accounting with the load forecast that must be filed with the Agency by July 15 of each year, in accordance with subsection (d) of Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act.  

A utility shall be deemed to have complied with the clean coal portfolio standard specified in this subsection (d) if the utility enters into a sourcing agreement as required by this subsection (d).  

(2) For purposes of this subsection (d), the required execution of sourcing agreements with the initial clean coal facility for a particular year shall be measured as a percentage of the actual amount of electricity (megawatt-hours) supplied by the electric utility to eligible retail customers in the planning year ending immediately prior to the agreement's execution. For purposes of this subsection (d), the amount paid per kilowatthour means the total amount paid for electric service expressed on a per kilowatthour basis. For purposes of this subsection (d), the total amount paid for electric service includes without limitation amounts paid for supply, transmission, distribution, surcharges and add-on taxes.  

Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection (d), the total amount paid under sourcing agreements with clean coal facilities pursuant to the procurement plan for any given year shall be reduced by an amount necessary to limit the annual estimated average net increase due to the costs of these resources included in the amounts paid by eligible retail customers in connection with electric service to:  

(A) in 2010, no more than 0.5% of the amount paid per kilowatthour by those customers during the year  

ending May 31, 2009;  

(B) in 2011, the greater of an additional 0.5% of the amount paid per kilowatthour by those customers during the year ending May 31, 2010 or 1% of the amount paid per kilowatthour by those customers during the year ending May 31, 2009;  

(C) in 2012, the greater of an additional 0.5% of the amount paid per kilowatthour by those customers during the year ending May 31, 2011 or 1.5% of the amount paid per kilowatthour by those customers during the year ending May 31, 2009;  

(D) in 2013, the greater of an additional 0.5% of the amount paid per kilowatthour by those customers during the year ending May 31, 2012 or 2% of the amount paid per kilowatthour by those customers during the year ending May 31, 2009; and  

(E) thereafter, the total amount paid under sourcing agreements with clean coal facilities pursuant to the procurement plan for any single year shall be reduced by an amount necessary to limit the estimated average net increase due to the cost of these resources included in the amounts paid by eligible retail customers in connection with electric service to no more than the greater of (i) 2.015% of the amount paid per kilowatthour by those customers during the year ending May 31, 2009 or (ii) the incremental amount per kilowatthour paid for these resources in 2013. These requirements may be altered only as provided by statute.  

No later than June 30, 2015, the Commission shall review the limitation on the total amount paid under sourcing agreements, if any, with clean coal facilities pursuant to this subsection (d) and report to the General Assembly its findings as to whether that limitation unduly constrains the amount of electricity generated by cost-effective clean coal facilities that is covered by sourcing agreements.  

(3) Initial clean coal facility. In order to promote development of clean coal facilities in Illinois, each electric utility subject to this Section shall execute a sourcing agreement to source electricity from a proposed clean coal facility in Illinois (the "initial clean coal facility") that will have a nameplate capacity of at least 500 MW when commercial operation commences, that has a final Clean Air Act permit on June 1, 2009 (the effective date of Public Act 95-1027), and that will meet the definition of clean coal facility in Section 1-10 of this Act when commercial operation commences. The sourcing agreements with this initial clean coal facility shall be subject to both approval of the initial clean coal facility by the General Assembly and satisfaction of the requirements of paragraph (4) of this subsection (d) and shall be executed within 90 days after any such approval by the General Assembly. The Agency and the Commission shall have authority to inspect all books and records associated with the initial clean coal facility during the term of such a sourcing agreement. A utility's sourcing agreement for electricity produced by the initial clean coal facility shall include:  

(A) a formula contractual price (the "contract price") approved pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection (d), which shall:  

(i) be determined using a cost of service methodology employing either a level or deferred capital recovery component, based on a capital structure consisting of $45\%$ equity and $55\%$ debt, and a return on equity as may be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which in any case may not exceed the lower of 11.5% or the rate of return approved by the General Assembly pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection (d); and  

(ii) provide that all miscellaneous net revenue, including but not limited to net revenue from the sale of emission allowances, if any, substitute natural gas, if any, grants or other support provided by the State of Illinois or the United States Government, firm transmission rights, if any, by-products produced by the facility, energy or capacity derived from the facility and not covered by a sourcing agreement pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection (d) or item (5) of subsection (d) of Section 16-115 of the Public Utilities Act, whether generated from the synthesis gas derived from coal, from SNG, or from natural gas, shall be credited against the revenue requirement for this initial clean coal facility;  

(B) power purchase provisions, which shall:  

(i) provide that the utility party to such sourcing agreement shall pay the contract price for electricity delivered under such sourcing agreement;  

(ii) require delivery of electricity to the regional transmission organization market of the utility that is party to such sourcing agreement;  

(iii) require the utility party to such sourcing agreement to buy from the initial clean coal facility in each hour an amount of energy equal to all clean coal energy made available from the initial clean coal facility during such hour times a fraction, the numerator of which is such utility's retail market sales of electricity (expressed in kilowatthours sold) in the State during the prior calendar month and the denominator of which is the total retail market sales of electricity (expressed in kilowatthours sold) in the State by utilities during such prior month and the sales of electricity (expressed in kilowatthours sold) in the State by alternative retail electric suppliers during such prior month that are subject to the requirements of this subsection (d) and paragraph (5) of subsection (d) of Section 16-115 of the Public Utilities Act, provided that the amount purchased by the utility in any year will be limited by paragraph (2) of this subsection (d); and  

(iv) be considered pre-existing contracts in such utility's procurement plans for eligible retail customers;  

(C) contract for differences provisions, which shall:  

(i) require the utility party to such sourcing agreement to contract with the initial clean coal facility in each hour with respect to an amount of energy equal to all clean coal energy made available from the initial clean coal facility during such hour times a fraction, the numerator of which is such utility's retail market sales of electricity (expressed in kilowatthours sold) in the utility's service territory in the State during the prior calendar month and the denominator of which is the total retail market sales of electricity (expressed in kilowatthours sold) in the State by utilities during such prior month and the sales of electricity (expressed in kilowatthours sold) in the State by alternative retail electric suppliers during such prior month that are subject to the requirements of this subsection (d) and paragraph (5) of subsection (d) of Section 16-115 of the Public Utilities Act, provided that the amount paid by the utility in any year will be limited by paragraph (2) of this subsection (d);  

(ii) provide that the utility's payment obligation in respect of the quantity of electricity determined pursuant to the preceding clause (i) shall be limited to an amount equal to (1) the difference between the contract price determined pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (3) of this subsection (d) and the day-ahead price for electricity delivered to the regional transmission organization market of the utility that is party to such sourcing agreement (or any successor delivery point at which such utility's supply obligations are financially settled on an hourly basis) (the "reference price") on the day preceding the day on which the electricity is delivered to the initial clean coal facility busbar, multiplied by (2) the quantity of electricity determined pursuant to the preceding clause (i); and  

(iii) not require the utility to take physical delivery of the electricity produced by the facility;  

(D) general provisions, which shall:  

(i) specify a term of no more than 30 years, commencing on the commercial operation date of the facility;  

(ii) provide that utilities shall maintain adequate records documenting purchases under the sourcing agreements entered into to comply with this subsection (d) and shall file an accounting with the load forecast that must be filed with the Agency by July 15 of each year, in accordance with subsection (d) of Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act;  

(iii) provide that all costs associated with the initial clean coal facility will be periodically reported to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and to purchasers in accordance with applicable laws governing cost-based wholesale power contracts;  

(iv) permit the Illinois Power Agency to assume ownership of the initial clean coal facility, without monetary consideration and otherwise on reasonable terms acceptable to the Agency, if the Agency so requests no less than years prior to the end of the stated contract term;  

(v) require the owner of the initial clean coal facility to provide documentation to the Commission each year, starting in the facility's first year of commercial operation, accurately reporting the quantity of carbon emissions from the facility that have been captured and sequestered and report any quantities of carbon released from the site or sites at which carbon emissions were sequestered in prior years, based on continuous monitoring of such sites. If, in any year after the first year of commercial operation, the owner of the facility fails to demonstrate that the initial clean coal facility captured and sequestered at least $50\%$ of the total carbon emissions that the facility would otherwise emit or that sequestration of emissions from prior years has failed, resulting in the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the owner of the facility must offset excess emissions. Any such carbon offsets must be permanent, additional, verifiable, real, located within the State of Illinois, and legally and practicably enforceable. The cost of such offsets for the facility that are not recoverable shall not exceed $\$15$ million in any given year. No costs of any such purchases of carbon offsets may be recovered from a utility or its customers. All carbon offsets purchased for this purpose and any carbon emission credits associated with sequestration of carbon from the facility must be permanently retired. The initial clean coal facility shall not forfeit its designation as a clean coal facility if the facility fails to fully comply with the applicable carbon sequestration requirements in any given year, provided the requisite offsets are purchased. However, the Attorney General, on behalf of the People of the State of Illinois, may specifically enforce the facility's sequestration requirement and the other terms of this contract provision. Compliance with the sequestration requirements and offset purchase requirements specified in paragraph (3) of this subsection (d) shall be reviewed annually by an independent expert retained by the owner of the initial clean coal facility, with the advance written approval of the Attorney General. The Commission may, in the course of the review specified in item (vii), reduce the allowable return on equity for the facility if the facility willfully fails to comply with the carbon capture and sequestration requirements set forth in this item (v);  

(vi) include limits on, and accordingly provide for modification of, the amount the utility is required to source under the sourcing agreement consistent with paragraph (2) of this subsection (d);  

(vii) require Commission review: (1) to determine the justness, reasonableness, and prudence of the inputs to the formula referenced in subparagraphs (A)(i) through (A)(iii) of paragraph (3) of this subsection (d), prior to an adjustment in those inputs including, without limitation, the capital structure and return on equity, fuel costs, and other operations and maintenance costs and (2) to approve the costs to be passed through to customers under the sourcing agreement by which the utility satisfies its statutory obligations. Commission review shall occur no less than every 3 years, regardless of whether any adjustments have been proposed, and shall be completed within 9 months;  

(viii) limit the utility's obligation to such amount as the utility is allowed to recover through tariffs filed with the Commission, provided that neither the clean coal facility nor the utility waives any right to assert federal pre-emption or any other argument in response to a purported disallowance of recovery costs;  

(ix) limit the utility's or alternative retail electric supplier's obligation to incur any liability until such time as the facility is in commercial operation and generating power and energy and such power and energy is being delivered to the facility busbar;  

(x) provide that the owner or owners of the initial clean coal facility, which is the counterparty to such sourcing agreement, shall have the right from time to time to elect whether the obligations of the utility party thereto shall be governed by the power purchase provisions or the contract for differences provisions;  

(xi) append documentation showing that the formula rate and contract, insofar as they relate to the power purchase provisions, have been approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pursuant to Section 205 of the Federal  

Power Act;  

(xii) provide that any changes to the terms of the contract, insofar as such changes relate to the power purchase provisions, are subject to review under the public interest standard applied by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pursuant to Sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act; and  

(xiii) conform with customary lender requirements in power purchase agreements used as the basis for financing non-utility generators.  

(4) Effective date of sourcing agreements with the initial clean coal facility. Any proposed sourcing agreement with the initial clean coal facility shall not become effective unless the following reports are prepared and submitted and authorizations and approvals obtained:  

(i) Facility cost report. The owner of the initial clean coal facility shall submit to the Commission, the Agency, and the General Assembly a front-end engineering and design study, a facility cost report, method of financing (including but not limited to structure and associated costs), and an operating and maintenance cost quote for the facility (collectively "facility cost report"), which shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (4) of subsection (d) of this Section, and shall provide the Commission and the Agency access to the work papers, relied upon documents, and any other backup documentation related to the facility cost report.  

(ii) Commission report. Within 6 months following receipt of the facility cost report, the Commission, in consultation with the Agency, shall submit a report to the General Assembly setting forth its analysis of the facility cost report. Such report shall include, but not be limited to, a comparison of the costs associated with electricity generated by the initial clean coal facility to the costs associated with electricity generated by other types of generation facilities, an analysis of the rate impacts on residential and small business customers over the life of the sourcing agreements, and an analysis of the likelihood that the initial clean coal facility will commence commercial operation by and be delivering power to the facility's busbar by 2016. To assist in the preparation of its report, the Commission, in consultation with the Agency, may hire one or more experts or consultants, the costs of which shall be paid for by the owner of the initial clean coal facility. The Commission and Agency may begin the process of selecting such experts or consultants prior to receipt of the facility cost report.  

(iii) General Assembly approval. The proposed sourcing agreements shall not take effect unless, based on the facility cost report and the Commission's report, the General Assembly enacts authorizing legislation approving (A) the projected price, stated in cents per kilowatthour, to be charged for electricity generated by the initial clean coal facility, (B) the projected impact on residential and small business customers' bills over the life of the sourcing agreements, and (C) the maximum allowable return on equity for the project; and  

(iv) Commission review. If the General Assembly enacts authorizing legislation pursuant to subparagraph (iii) approving a sourcing agreement, the Commission shall, within 90 days of such enactment, complete a review of such sourcing agreement. During such time period, the Commission shall implement any directive of the General Assembly, resolve any disputes between the parties to the sourcing agreement concerning the terms of such agreement, approve the form of such agreement, and issue an order finding that the sourcing agreement is prudent and reasonable. The facility cost report shall be prepared as follows:  

(A) The facility cost report shall be prepared by duly licensed engineering and construction firms detailing the estimated capital costs payable to one or more contractors or suppliers for the engineering, procurement and construction of the components comprising the initial clean coal facility and the estimated costs of operation and maintenance of the facility. The facility cost report shall include:  

(i) an estimate of the capital cost of the core plant based on one or more front end engineering and design studies for the gasification island and related facilities. The core plant shall include all civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, control, and safety systems.  

(ii) an estimate of the capital cost of the balance of the plant, including any capital costs associated with sequestration of carbon dioxide emissions and all interconnects and interfaces required to operate the facility, such as transmission of electricity, construction or backfeed power supply, pipelines to transport substitute natural gas or carbon dioxide, potable water supply, natural gas supply, water supply, water discharge, landfill, access roads, and coal delivery.  

The quoted construction costs shall be expressed in nominal dollars as of the date that the quote is prepared and shall include capitalized financing costs during construction, taxes, insurance, and other owner's costs, and an assumed escalation in materials and labor beyond the date as of which the construction cost quote is expressed.  

(B) The front end engineering and design study for the gasification island and the cost study for the balance of plant shall include sufficient design work to permit quantification of major categories of materials, commodities and labor hours, and receipt of quotes from vendors of major equipment required to construct and operate the clean coal facility.  

(C) The facility cost report shall also include an operating and maintenance cost quote that will provide the estimated cost of delivered fuel, personnel, maintenance contracts, chemicals, catalysts, consumables, spares, and other fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs. The delivered fuel cost estimate will be provided by a recognized third party expert or experts in the fuel and transportation industries. The balance of the operating and maintenance cost quote, excluding delivered fuel costs, will be developed based on the inputs provided by duly licensed engineering and construction firms performing the construction cost quote, potential vendors under long-term service agreements and plant operating agreements, or recognized third party plant operator or operators.  

The operating and maintenance cost quote (including the cost of the front end engineering and design study) shall be expressed in nominal dollars as of the date that the quote is prepared and shall include taxes, insurance, and other owner's costs, and an assumed escalation in materials and labor beyond the date as of which the operating and maintenance cost quote is expressed.  

(D) The facility cost report shall also include an analysis of the initial clean coal facility's ability to deliver power and energy into the applicable regional transmission organization markets and an analysis of the expected capacity factor for the initial clean coal facility.  

(E) Amounts paid to third parties unrelated to the owner or owners of the initial clean coal facility to prepare the core plant construction cost quote, including the front end engineering and design study, and the operating and maintenance cost quote will be reimbursed through Coal Development Bonds.  

(5) Re-powering and retrofitting coal-fired power plants previously owned by Illinois utilities to qualify as clean coal facilities. During the 2009 procurement planning process and thereafter, the Agency and the Commission shall consider sourcing agreements covering electricity generated by power plants that were previously owned by Illinois utilities and that have been or will be converted into clean coal facilities, as defined by Section 1-10 of this Act. Pursuant to such procurement planning process, the owners of such facilities may propose to the Agency sourcing agreements with utilities and alternative retail electric suppliers required to comply with subsection (d) of this Section and item (5) of subsection (d) of Section 16-115 of the Public Utilities Act, covering electricity generated by such facilities. In the case of sourcing agreements that are power purchase agreements, the contract price for electricity sales shall be established on a cost of service basis. In the case of sourcing agreements that are contracts for differences, the contract price from which the reference price is subtracted shall be established on a cost of service basis. The Agency and the Commission may approve any such utility sourcing agreements that do not exceed cost-based benchmarks developed by the procurement administrator, in consultation with the Commission staff, Agency staff and the procurement monitor, subject to Commission review and approval. The Commission shall have authority to inspect all books and records associated with these clean coal facilities during the term of any such contract.  

(6) Costs incurred under this subsection (d) or pursuant to a contract entered into under this subsection (d) shall be deemed prudently incurred and reasonable in amount and the electric utility shall be entitled to full cost recovery pursuant to the tariffs filed with the Commission.  

(d-5) Zero emission standard.  

(1) Beginning with the delivery year commencing on June 1, 2017, the Agency shall, for electric utilities that serve at least 100,000 retail customers in this State, procure contracts with zero emission facilities that are reasonably capable of generating cost-effective zero emission credits in an amount approximately equal to $16\%$ of the actual amount of electricity delivered by each electric utility to retail customers in the State during calendar year 2014. For an electric utility serving fewer than 100,000 retail customers in this State that requested, under Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act, that the Agency procure power and energy for all or a portion of the utility's Illinois load for the delivery year commencing June 1, 2016, the Agency shall procure contracts with zero emission facilities that are reasonably capable of generating cost-effective zero emission credits in an amount approximately equal to 16% of the portion of power and energy to be procured by the Agency for the utility. The duration of the contracts procured under this subsection (d-5) shall be for a term of 10 years ending May 31, 2027. The quantity of zero emission credits to be procured under the contracts shall be all of the zero emission credits generated by the zero emission facility in each delivery year; however, if the zero emission facility is owned by more than one entity, then the quantity of zero emission credits to be procured under the contracts shall be the amount of zero emission credits that are generated from the portion of the zero emission facility that is owned by the winning supplier.  

The 16% value identified in this paragraph (1) is the average of the percentage targets in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of this Section for the 5 delivery years beginning June 1, 2017.  

The procurement process shall be subject to the following provisions:  

(A) Those zero emission facilities that intend to participate in the procurement shall submit to the Agency the following eligibility information for each zero emission facility on or before the date established by the Agency:  

(i) the in-service date and remaining useful life of the zero emission facility;  

(ii) the amount of power generated annually for each of the years 2005 through 2015, and the projected zero emission credits to be generated over the remaining useful life of the zero emission facility, which shall be used to determine the capability of each facility;  

(iii) the annual zero emission facility cost projections, expressed on a per megawatthour basis, over the next 6 delivery years, which shall include the following: operation and maintenance expenses; fully allocated overhead costs, which shall be allocated using the methodology developed by the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations; fuel expenditures; non-fuel capital expenditures; spent fuel expenditures; a return on working capital; the cost of operational and market risks that could be avoided by ceasing operation; and any other costs necessary for continued operations, provided that "necessary" means, for purposes of this item (iii), that the costs could reasonably be avoided only by ceasing operations of the zero emission facility; and  

(iv) a commitment to continue operating, for the duration of the contract or contracts executed under the procurement held under this subsection (d-5), the zero emission facility that produces the zero emission credits to be procured in the procurement.  

The information described in item (iii) of this subparagraph (A) may be submitted on a confidential basis and shall be treated and maintained by the Agency, the procurement administrator, and the  

Commission as confidential and proprietary and exempt from disclosure under subparagraphs (a) and (g) of paragraph (1) of Section 7 of the Freedom of Information Act. The Office of Attorney General shall have access to, and maintain the confidentiality of, such information pursuant to Section 6.5 of the Attorney General Act.  

(B) The price for each zero emission credit procured under this subsection (d-5) for each delivery year shall be in an amount that equals the Social Cost of Carbon, expressed on a price per megawatthour basis. However, to ensure that the procurement remains affordable to retail customers in this State if electricity prices increase, the price in an applicable delivery year shall be reduced below the Social Cost of Carbon by the amount ("Price Adjustment") by which the market price index for the applicable delivery year exceeds the baseline market price index for the consecutive 12-month period ending May 31, 2016. If the Price Adjustment is greater than or equal to the Social Cost of Carbon in an applicable delivery year, then no payments shall be due in that delivery year. The components of this calculation are defined as follows:  

(i) Social Cost of Carbon: The Social Cost of Carbon is $\$16.50$ per megawatthour, which is based on the U.S. Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon's price in the August 2016 Technical Update using a $3\%$ discount rate, adjusted for inflation for each year of the program. Beginning with the delivery year commencing June 1, 2023, the price per megawatthour shall increase by \$1 per megawatthour, and continue to increase by an additional $\$1$ per megawatthour each delivery year thereafter.  

(ii) Baseline market price index: The baseline market price index for the consecutive 12-month period ending May 31, 2016 is $\$31$ .40 per megawatthour, which is based on the sum of (aa) the average day-ahead energy price across all hours of such 12-month period at the PJM Interconnection LLC Northern Illinois Hub, (bb) $50\%$ multiplied by the Base Residual Auction, or its successor, capacity price for the rest of the RTO zone group determined by PJM Interconnection LLC, divided by 24 hours per day, and (cc) $50\%$ multiplied by the Planning Resource Auction, or its successor, capacity price for Zone 4 determined by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc., divided by 24 hours per day.  

(iii) Market price index: The market price index for a delivery year shall be the sum of projected energy prices and projected capacity prices determined as follows:  

(aa) Projected energy prices: the projected energy prices for the applicable delivery year shall be calculated once for the year using the forward market price for the PJM Interconnection, LLC Northern Illinois Hub. The forward market price shall be calculated as follows: the energy forward prices for each month of the applicable delivery year averaged for each trade date during the calendar year immediately preceding that delivery year to produce a single energy forward price for the delivery year. The forward market price calculation shall use data published by the Intercontinental Exchange, or its successor.  

(bb) Projected capacity prices:  

(I) For the delivery years commencing June 1, 2017, June 1, 2018, and June 1, 2019, the projected capacity price shall be equal to the sum of (1) $50\%$ multiplied by the Base Residual Auction, or its successor, price for the rest of the RTO zone group as determined by PJM  

Interconnection LLC, divided by 24 hours per day and, (2) $50\%$ multiplied by the resource auction price determined in the resource auction administered by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc., in which the largest percentage of load cleared for Local Resource Zone 4, divided by 24 hours per day, and where such price is determined by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc.  

(II) For the delivery year commencing June 1, 2020, and each year thereafter, the projected capacity price shall be equal to the sum of (1) $50\%$ multiplied by the Base Residual Auction, or its successor, price for the ComEd zone as determined by PJM Interconnection LLC, divided by 24 hours per day, and (2) $50\%$ multiplied by the resource auction price determined in the resource auction administered by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc., in which the largest percentage of load cleared for Local Resource Zone 4, divided by 24 hours per day, and where such price  

is determined by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. For purposes of this subsection (d-5):  

"Rest of the RTO" and "ComEd Zone" shall have the meaning ascribed to them by PJM Interconnection, LLC.  

"RTO" means regional transmission organization.  

(C) No later than 45 days after June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906), the Agency shall publish its proposed zero emission standard procurement plan. The plan shall be consistent with the provisions of this paragraph (1) and shall provide that winning bids shall be selected based on public interest criteria that include, but are not limited to, minimizing carbon dioxide emissions that result from electricity consumed in Illinois and minimizing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter emissions that adversely affect the citizens of this State. In particular, the selection of winning bids shall take into account the incremental environmental benefits resulting from the procurement, such as any existing environmental benefits that are preserved by the procurements held under Public Act 99-906 and would cease to exist if the procurements were not held, including the preservation of zero emission facilities. The plan shall also describe in detail how each public interest factor shall be considered and weighted in the bid selection process to ensure that the public interest criteria are applied to the procurement and given full effect.  

For purposes of developing the plan, the Agency shall consider any reports issued by a State agency, board, or commission under House Resolution 1146 of the 98th General Assembly and paragraph (4) of subsection (d) of this Section, as well as publicly available analyses and studies performed by or for regional transmission organizations that serve the State and their independent market monitors.  

Upon publishing of the zero emission standard procurement plan, copies of the plan shall be posted and made publicly available on the Agency's website. All interested parties shall have 10 days following the date of posting to provide comment to the Agency on the plan. All comments shall be posted to the Agency's website. Following the end of the comment period, but no more than 60 days later than June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906), the Agency shall revise the plan as necessary based on the comments received and file its zero emission standard procurement plan with the Commission.  

If the Commission determines that the plan will result in the procurement of cost-effective zero emission credits, then the Commission shall, after notice and hearing, but no later than 45 days after the Agency filed the plan, approve the plan or approve with modification. For purposes of this subsection (d-5), "cost effective" means the projected costs of procuring zero emission credits from zero emission facilities do not cause the limit stated in paragraph (2) of this subsection to be exceeded.  

(C-5) As part of the Commission's review and acceptance or rejection of the procurement results, the Commission shall, in its public notice of successful bidders:  

(i) identify how the winning bids satisfy the public interest criteria described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (1) of minimizing carbon dioxide emissions that result from electricity consumed in Illinois and minimizing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter emissions that adversely affect the citizens of this State;  

(ii) specifically address how the selection of winning bids takes into account the incremental environmental benefits resulting from the procurement, including any existing environmental benefits that are preserved by the procurements held under Public Act 99-906 and would have ceased to exist if the procurements had not been held, such as the preservation of zero emission facilities;  

(iii) quantify the environmental benefit of preserving the resources identified in item (ii) of this subparagraph (C-5), including the following:  

(aa) the value of avoided greenhouse gas emissions measured as the product of the zero emission facilities' output over the contract term multiplied by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency eGrid subregion carbon dioxide emission rate and the U.S. Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon's price in the August 2016 Technical Update using a $3\%$ discount rate, adjusted for inflation for each delivery year; and  

(bb) the costs of replacement with other zero carbon dioxide resources, including wind and photovoltaic, based upon the simple average of the following:  

(I) the price, or if there is more than one price, the average of the prices, paid for renewable energy credits from new utility-scale wind projects in the procurement events specified in item (i) of subparagraph (G) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of this Section; and  

(II) the price, or if there is more than one price, the average of the prices, paid for renewable energy credits from new utility-scale solar projects and brownfield site photovoltaic projects in the procurement events specified in item (ii) of subparagraph (G) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of this Section and, after January 1, 2015, renewable energy credits from photovoltaic distributed generation projects in procurement events held under subsection (c) of this Section.  

Each utility shall enter into binding contractual arrangements with the winning suppliers.  

The procurement described in this subsection (d-5), including, but not limited to, the execution of all contracts procured, shall be completed no later than May 10, 2017. Based on the effective date of Public Act 99-906, the Agency and Commission may, as appropriate, modify the various dates and timelines under this subparagraph and subparagraphs (C) and (D) of this paragraph (1). The procurement and plan approval processes required by this subsection (d-5)  

shall be conducted in conjunction with the procurement and plan approval processes required by subsection (c) of this Section and Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act, to the extent practicable. Notwithstanding whether a procurement event is conducted under Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act, the Agency shall immediately initiate a procurement process on June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906).  

(D) Following the procurement event described in this paragraph (1) and consistent with subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (1), the Agency shall calculate the payments to be made under each contract for the next delivery year based on the market price index for that delivery year. The Agency shall publish the payment calculations no later than May 25, 2017 and every May 25 thereafter.  

(E) Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection (d-5), the contracts executed under this subsection (d-5) shall provide that the zero emission facility may, as applicable, suspend or terminate performance under the contracts in the following instances:  

(i) A zero emission facility shall be excused from its performance under the contract for any cause beyond the control of the resource, including, but not restricted to, acts of God, flood, drought, earthquake, storm, fire, lightning, epidemic, war, riot, civil disturbance or disobedience, labor dispute, labor or material shortage, sabotage, acts of public enemy, explosions, orders, regulations or restrictions imposed by governmental, military, or lawfully established civilian authorities, which, in any of the foregoing cases, by exercise of commercially reasonable efforts the zero emission facility could not reasonably have been expected to avoid, and which, by the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, it has been unable to overcome. In such event, the zero emission facility shall be excused from performance for the duration of the event, including, but not limited to, delivery of zero emission credits, and no payment shall be due to the zero emission facility during the duration of the event.  

(ii) A zero emission facility shall be permitted to terminate the contract if legislation is enacted into law by the General Assembly that imposes or authorizes a new tax, special assessment, or fee on the generation of electricity, the ownership or leasehold of a generating unit, or the privilege or occupation of such generation, ownership, or leasehold of generation units by a zero emission facility. However, the provisions of this item (ii) do not apply to any generally applicable tax, special assessment or fee, or requirements imposed by federal law.  

(iii) A zero emission facility shall be permitted to terminate the contract in the event that the resource requires capital expenditures in excess of \$40,000,000 that were neither known nor reasonably foreseeable at the time it executed the contract and that a prudent owner or operator of such resource would not undertake.  

(iv) A zero emission facility shall be permitted to terminate the contract in the event the Nuclear Regulatory Commission terminates the resource's license.  

(F) If the zero emission facility elects to terminate a contract under subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (1), then the Commission shall reopen the docket in which the Commission approved the zero emission standard procurement plan under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (1) and, after notice and hearing, enter an order acknowledging the contract termination election if such termination is consistent with the provisions of this subsection (d-5).  

(2) For purposes of this subsection (d-5), the amount paid per kilowatthour means the total amount paid for electric service expressed on a per kilowatthour basis. For purposes of this subsection (d-5), the total amount paid for electric service includes, without limitation, amounts paid for supply, transmission, distribution, surcharges, and add-on taxes.  

Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection (d-5), the contracts executed under this subsection (d-5) shall provide that the total of zero emission credits procured under a procurement plan shall be subject to the limitations of this paragraph (2). For each delivery year, the contractual volume receiving payments in such year shall be reduced for all retail customers based on the amount necessary to limit the net increase that delivery year to the costs of those credits included in the amounts paid by eligible retail customers in connection with electric service to no more than 1.65% of the amount paid per kilowatthour by eligible retail customers during the year ending May 31, 2009. The result of this computation shall apply to and reduce the procurement for all retail customers, and all those customers shall pay the same single, uniform cents per kilowatthour charge under subsection (k) of Section 16-108 of the Public Utilities Act. To arrive at a maximum dollar amount of zero emission credits to be paid for the particular delivery year, the resulting per kilowatthour amount shall be applied to the actual amount of kilowatthours of electricity delivered by the electric utility in the delivery year immediately prior to the procurement, to all retail customers in its service territory. Unpaid contractual volume for any delivery year shall be paid in any subsequent delivery year in which such payments can be made without exceeding the amount specified in this paragraph (2). The calculations required by this paragraph (2) shall be made only once for each procurement plan year. Once the determination as to the amount of zero emission credits to be paid is made based on the calculations set forth in this paragraph (2), no subsequent rate impact determinations shall be made and no adjustments to those contract amounts shall be allowed. All costs incurred under those contracts and in implementing this subsection (d-5) shall be recovered by the electric utility as provided in this Section.  

No later than June 30, 2019, the Commission shall review the limitation on the amount of zero emission credits procured under this subsection (d-5) and report to the General Assembly its findings as to whether that limitation unduly constrains the procurement of cost-effective zero emission credits.  

(3) Six years after the execution of a contract under this subsection (d-5), the Agency shall determine whether the actual zero emission credit payments received by the supplier over the 6-year period exceed the Average ZEC Payment. In addition, at the end of the term of a contract executed under this subsection (d-5), or at the time, if any, a zero emission facility's contract is terminated under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) of this subsection (d-5), then the Agency shall determine whether the actual zero emission credit payments received by the supplier over the term of the contract exceed the Average ZEC Payment, after taking into account any amounts previously credited back to the utility under this paragraph (3). If the Agency determines that the actual zero emission credit payments received by the supplier over the relevant period exceed the Average ZEC Payment, then the supplier shall credit the difference back to the utility. The amount of the credit shall be remitted to the applicable electric utility no later than 120 days after the Agency's determination, which the utility shall reflect as a credit on its retail customer bills as soon as practicable; however, the credit remitted to the utility shall not exceed the total amount of payments received by the facility under its contract.  

For purposes of this Section, the Average ZEC Payment shall be calculated by multiplying the quantity of zero emission credits delivered under the contract times the average contract price. The average contract price shall be determined by subtracting the amount calculated under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (3) from the amount calculated under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (3), as follows:  

(A) The average of the Social Cost of Carbon, as defined in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection (d-5), during the term of the contract.  

(B) The average of the market price indices, as defined in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection (d-5), during the term of the contract, minus the baseline market price index, as defined in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection (d-5).  

If the subtraction yields a negative number, then the Average ZEC Payment shall be zero.  

(4) Cost-effective zero emission credits procured from zero emission facilities shall satisfy the applicable definitions set forth in Section 1-10 of this Act.  

(5) The electric utility shall retire all zero emission credits used to comply with the requirements of this subsection (d-5).  

(6) Electric utilities shall be entitled to recover all of the costs associated with the procurement of zero emission credits through an automatic adjustment clause tariff in accordance with subsection (k) and (m) of Section 16-108 of the Public Utilities Act, and the contracts executed under this subsection (d-5) shall provide that the utilities' payment obligations under such contracts shall be reduced if an adjustment is required under subsection (m) of Section 16-108 of the Public Utilities Act.  

(7) This subsection (d-5) shall become inoperative on January 1, 2028. (d-10) Nuclear Plant Assistance; carbon mitigation credits.  

(1) The General Assembly finds: (A) The health, welfare, and prosperity of all Illinois citizens require that the State of Illinois act to avoid and not increase carbon emissions from electric generation sources while continuing to ensure affordable, stable, and reliable electricity to all citizens.  

(B) Absent immediate action by the State to preserve existing carbon-free energy resources, those resources may retire, and the electric generation needs of Illinois' retail customers may be met instead by facilities that emit significant amounts of carbon pollution and other harmful air pollutants at a high social and economic cost until Illinois is able to develop other forms of clean energy.  

(C) The General Assembly finds that nuclear power generation is necessary for the State's transition to 100% clean energy, and ensuring continued operation of nuclear plants advances environmental and public health interests through providing carbon-free electricity while reducing the air pollution profile of the Illinois energy generation fleet.  

(D) The clean energy attributes of nuclear generation facilities support the State in its efforts to achieve 100% clean energy.  

(E) The State currently invests in various forms of clean energy, including, but not limited to, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and low-emission vehicles, among others.  

(F) The Environmental Protection Agency commissioned an independent audit which provided a detailed assessment of the financial condition of the Illinois nuclear fleet to evaluate its financial viability and whether the environmental benefits of such resources were at risk. The report identified the risk of losing the environmental benefits of several specific nuclear units. The report also identified that the LaSalle County Generating Station will continue to operate through 2026 and therefore is not eligible to participate in the carbon mitigation credit program.  

(G) Nuclear plants provide carbon-free energy, which helps to avoid many health-related negative impacts for Illinois residents.  

(H) The procurement of carbon mitigation credits representing the environmental benefits of carbon-free generation will further the State's efforts at achieving 100% clean energy and decarbonizing the electricity sector in a safe, reliable, and affordable manner. Further, the procurement of carbon emission credits will enhance the health and welfare of Illinois residents through decreased reliance on more highly polluting generation.  

(I) The General Assembly therefore finds it necessary to establish carbon mitigation credits to ensure decreased reliance on more carbon-intensive energy resources, for transitioning to a fully decarbonized electricity sector, and to help ensure health and welfare of the State's residents.  

(2) As used in this subsection:  

"Baseline costs" means costs used to establish a customer protection cap that have been evaluated through an independent audit of a carbon-free energy resource conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency that evaluated projected annual costs for operation and maintenance expenses; fully allocated overhead costs, which shall be allocated using the methodology developed by the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations; fuel expenditures; nonfuel capital expenditures; spent fuel expenditures; a return on working capital; the cost of operational and market risks that could be avoided by ceasing operation; and any other costs necessary for continued operations, provided that "necessary" means, for purposes of this definition, that the costs could reasonably be avoided only by ceasing operations of the carbon-free energy resource.  

"Carbon mitigation credit" means a tradable credit that represents the carbon emission reduction attributes of one megawatt-hour of energy produced from a carbon-free energy resource.  

"Carbon-free energy resource" means a generation facility that: (1) is fueled by nuclear power; and (2) is interconnected to PJM Interconnection, LLC.  

(3) Procurement.  

(A) Beginning with the delivery year commencing on June 1, 2022, the Agency shall, for electric utilities serving at least 3,000,000 retail customers in the State, seek to procure contracts for no more than approximately 54,500,000 cost-effective carbon mitigation credits from carbon-free energy resources because such credits are necessary to support current levels of carbon-free energy generation and ensure the State meets its carbon dioxide emissions reduction goals. The Agency shall not make a partial award of a contract for carbon mitigation credits covering a fractional amount of a carbon-free energy resource's projected output.  

(B) Each carbon-free energy resource that intends to participate in a procurement shall be required to submit to the Agency the following information for the resource on or before the date established by the Agency:  

(i) the in-service date and remaining useful life   
of the carbon-free energy resource; (ii) the amount of power generated annually for   
each of the past 10 years, which shall be used to   
determine the capability of each facility; (iii) a commitment to be reflected in any contract   
entered into pursuant to this subsection (d-10) to   
continue operating the carbon-free energy resource at   
a capacity factor of at least 88% annually on average   
for the duration of the contract or contracts executed   
under the procurement held under this subsection   
(d-10), except in an instance described in   
subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d-5)   
of this Section or made impracticable as a result of   
compliance with law or regulation; (iv) financial need and the risk of loss of the   
environmental benefits of such resource, which shall   
include the following information: (I) the carbon-free energy resource's cost projections, expressed on a per megawatt-hour basis, over the next 5 delivery years, which shall include the following: operation and maintenance expenses; fully allocated overhead costs, which shall be allocated using the methodology developed by the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations; fuel expenditures; nonfuel capital expenditures;  

spent fuel expenditures; a return on working capital; the cost of operational and market risks that could be avoided by ceasing operation; and any other costs necessary for continued operations, provided that "necessary" means, for purposes of this subitem (I), that the costs could reasonably be avoided only by ceasing operations of the carbon-free energy resource; and  

(II) the carbon-free energy resource's revenue projections, including energy, capacity, ancillary services, any other direct State support, known or anticipated federal attribute credits, known or anticipated tax credits, and any other direct federal support.  

The information described in this subparagraph (B) may be submitted on a confidential basis and shall be treated and maintained by the Agency, the procurement administrator, and the Commission as confidential and proprietary and exempt from disclosure under subparagraphs (a) and (g) of paragraph (1) of Section 7 of the Freedom of Information Act. The Office of the Attorney General shall have access to, and maintain the confidentiality of, such information pursuant to Section 6.5 of the Attorney General Act.  

(C) The Agency shall solicit bids for the contracts described in this subsection (d-10) from carbon-free energy resources that have satisfied the requirements of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (3). The contracts procured pursuant to a procurement event shall reflect, and be subject to, the following terms, requirements, and limitations:  

(i) Contracts are for delivery of carbon mitigation credits, and are not energy or capacity sales contracts requiring physical delivery. Pursuant to item (iii), contract payments shall fully deduct the value of any monetized federal production tax credits, credits issued pursuant to a federal clean energy standard, and other federal credits if applicable.  

(ii) Contracts for carbon mitigation credits shall commence with the delivery year beginning on June 1, 2022 and shall be for a term of 5 delivery years concluding on May 31, 2027.  

(iii) The price per carbon mitigation credit to be paid under a contract for a given delivery year shall be equal to an accepted bid price less the sum of:  

(I) one of the following energy price indices, selected by the bidder at the time of the bid for the term of the contract:  

(aa) the weighted-average hourly day-ahead price for the applicable delivery year at the busbar of all resources procured pursuant to  

this subsection (d-10), weighted by actual production from the resources; or   
(bb) the projected energy price for the PJM Interconnection, LLC Northern Illinois Hub for the applicable delivery year determined according to subitem (aa) of item (iii) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d-5).  

(II) the Base Residual Auction Capacity Price for the ComEd zone as determined by PJM Interconnection, LLC, divided by 24 hours per day, for the applicable delivery year for the first 3 delivery years, and then any subsequent delivery years unless the PJM Interconnection, LLC applies the Minimum Offer Price Rule to participating carbon-free energy resources because they supply carbon mitigation credits pursuant to this Section at which time, upon notice by the carbon-free energy resource to the Commission and subject to the Commission's confirmation, the value under this subitem shall be zero, as further described in the carbon mitigation credit procurement plan; and  

(III) any value of monetized federal tax credits, direct payments, or similar subsidy provided to the carbon-free energy resource from any unit of government that is not already reflected in energy prices.  

If the price-per-megawatt-hour calculation performed under item (iii) of this subparagraph (C) for a given delivery year results in a net positive value, then the electric utility counterparty to the contract shall multiply such net value by the applicable contract quantity and remit the amount to the supplier.  

To protect retail customers from retail rate impacts that may arise upon the initiation of carbon policy changes, if the price-per-megawatt-hour calculation performed under item (iii) of this subparagraph (C) for a given delivery year results in a net negative value, then the supplier counterparty to the contract shall multiply such net value by the applicable contract quantity and remit such amount to the electric utility counterparty. The electric utility shall reflect such amounts remitted by suppliers as a credit on its retail customer bills as soon as practicable.  

(iv) to ensure that retail customers in Northern Illinois do not pay more for carbon mitigation credits than the value such credits provide, and notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d-10), the Agency shall not accept bids for contracts  

LRB102 11366 BMS 16699 b at exceed a customer protection cap equal to the seline costs of carbon-free energy resources. The baseline costs for the applicable year shall the following: (I) For the delivery year beginning June 1, 2022, the baseline costs shall be an amount equal to \$30.30 per megawatt-hour. (II) For the delivery year beginning June 1, 2023, the baseline costs shall be an amount equal to \$32.50 per megawatt-hour. (III) For the delivery year beginning June 1, 2024, the baseline costs shall be an amount equal to \$33.43 per megawatt-hour. (IV) For the delivery year beginning June 1, 2025, the baseline costs shall be an amount equal to \$33.50 per megawatt-hour. (V) For the delivery year beginning June 1, 2026, the baseline costs shall be an amount equal to \$34.50 per megawatt-hour. An Environmental Protection Agency consultant recast, included in a report issued April 14, 2021, ojects that a carbon-free energy resource has the portunity to earn on average approximately \$30.28 r megawatt-hour, for the sale of energy and capacity during the time period between 2022 and 2027. erefore, the sale of carbon mitigation credits provides the opportunity to receive an additional amount per megawatt-hour in addition to the projected prices for energy and capacity.  

Although actual energy and capacity prices may vary from year-to-year, the General Assembly finds that this customer protection cap will help ensure that the cost of carbon mitigation credits will be less than its value, based upon the social cost of carbon identified in the Technical Support Document issued in February 2021 by the U.S. Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases and the PJM Interconnection, LLC carbon dioxide marginal emission rate for 2020, and that a carbon-free energy resource receiving payment for carbon mitigation credits receives no more than necessary to keep those units in operation.  

(D) No later than 7 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, the Agency shall publish its proposed carbon mitigation credit procurement plan. The Plan shall provide that winning bids shall be selected by taking into consideration which resources best match public interest criteria that include, but are not limited to, minimizing carbon dioxide emissions that result from electricity consumed in Illinois and minimizing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter emissions that adversely affect the citizens of this State. The selection of winning bids shall also take into account the incremental environmental benefits resulting from the procurement or procurements, such as any existing environmental benefits that are preserved by a procurement held under this subsection (d-10) and would cease to exist if the procurement were not held, including the preservation of carbon-free energy resources. For those bidders having the same public interest criteria score, the relative ranking of such bidders shall be determined by price. The Plan shall describe in detail how each public interest factor shall be considered and weighted in the bid selection process to ensure that the public interest criteria are applied to the procurement. The Plan shall, to the extent practical and permissible by federal law, ensure that successful bidders make commercially reasonable efforts to apply for federal tax credits, direct payments, or similar subsidy programs that support carbon-free generation and for which the successful bidder is eligible. Upon publishing of the carbon mitigation credit procurement plan, copies of the plan shall be posted and made publicly available on the Agency's website. All interested parties shall have 7 days following the date of posting to provide comment to the Agency on the plan. All comments shall be posted to the Agency's website. Following the end of the comment period, but no more than 19 days later than the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, the Agency shall revise the plan as necessary based on the comments received and file its carbon mitigation credit procurement plan with the Commission.  

(E) If the Commission determines that the plan is likely to result in the procurement of cost-effective carbon mitigation credits, then the Commission shall, after notice and hearing and opportunity for comment, but no later than 42 days after the Agency filed the plan, approve the plan or approve it with modification. For purposes of this subsection (d-10), "cost-effective" means carbon mitigation credits that are procured from carbon-free energy resources at prices that are within the limits specified in this paragraph (3). As part of the Commission's review and acceptance or rejection of the procurement results, the Commission shall, in its public notice of successful bidders:  

(i) identify how the selected carbon-free energy   
resources satisfy the public interest criteria   
described in this paragraph (3) of minimizing carbon   
dioxide emissions that result from electricity   
consumed in Illinois and minimizing sulfur dioxide,   
nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter emissions that   
adversely affect the citizens of this State; (ii) specifically address how the selection of   
carbon-free energy resources takes into account the  

incremental environmental benefits resulting from the procurement, including any existing environmental benefits that are preserved by the procurements held under this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly and would have ceased to exist if the procurements had not been held, such as the preservation of carbon-free energy resources;  

(iii) quantify the environmental benefit of preserving the carbon-free energy resources procured pursuant to this subsection (d-10), including the following:  

(I) an assessment value of avoided greenhouse gas emissions measured as the product of the carbon-free energy resources' output over the contract term, using generally accepted methodologies for the valuation of avoided emissions; and  

(II) an assessment of costs of replacement with other carbon-free energy resources and renewable energy resources, including wind and photovoltaic generation, based upon an assessment of the prices paid for renewable energy credits through programs and procurements conducted pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of this Act, and the additional storage necessary to produce the same or similar capability of matching  

customer usage patterns.  

(F) The procurements described in this paragraph (3), including, but not limited to, the execution of all contracts procured, shall be completed no later than December 3, 2021. The procurement and plan approval processes required by this paragraph (3) shall be conducted in conjunction with the procurement and plan approval processes required by Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act, to the extent practicable. However, the Agency and Commission may, as appropriate, modify the various dates and timelines under this subparagraph and subparagraphs (D) and (E) of this paragraph (3) to meet the December 3, 2021 contract execution deadline. Following the completion of such procurements, and consistent with this paragraph (3), the Agency shall calculate the payments to be made under each contract in a timely fashion.  

(F-1) Costs incurred by the electric utility pursuant to a contract authorized by this subsection (d-10) shall be deemed prudently incurred and reasonable in amount, and the electric utility shall be entitled to full cost recovery pursuant to a tariff or tariffs filed with the Commission.  

(G) The counterparty electric utility shall retire all carbon mitigation credits used to comply with the requirements of this subsection (d-10).  

(H) If a carbon-free energy resource is sold to another owner, the rights, obligations, and commitments under this subsection (d-10) shall continue to the subsequent owner.  

(I) This subsection (d-10) shall become inoperative on January 1, 2028.  

(e) The draft procurement plans are subject to public comment, as required by Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act.  

(f) The Agency shall submit the final procurement plan to the Commission. The Agency shall revise a procurement plan if the Commission determines that it does not meet the standards set forth in Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act.  

(g) The Agency shall assess fees to each affected utility to recover the costs incurred in preparation of the annual procurement plan for the utility.  

(h) The Agency shall assess fees to each bidder to recover the costs incurred in connection with a competitive procurement process.  

(i) A renewable energy credit, carbon emission credit, or zero emission credit, or carbon mitigation credit can only be used once to comply with a single portfolio or other standard as set forth in subsection (c), subsection (d), or subsection (d-5) of this Section, respectively. A renewable energy credit, carbon emission credit, or zero emission credit, or carbon mitigation credit cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of more than one standard. If more than one type of credit is issued for the same megawatt hour of energy, only one credit can be used to satisfy the requirements of a single standard. After such use, the credit must be retired together with any other credits issued for the same megawatt hour of energy.

(20 ILCS 3855/1-92)  

Sec. 1-92. Aggregation of electrical load by municipalities, townships, and counties.  

(a) The corporate authorities of a municipality, township board, or county board of a county may adopt an ordinance under which it may aggregate in accordance with this Section residential and small commercial retail electrical loads located, respectively, within the municipality, the township, or the unincorporated areas of the county and, for that purpose, may solicit bids and enter into service agreements to facilitate for those loads the sale and purchase of electricity and related services and equipment.  

The corporate authorities, township board, or county board may also exercise such authority jointly with any other municipality, township, or county. Two or more municipalities, townships, or counties, or a combination of both, may initiate a process jointly to authorize aggregation by a majority vote of each particular municipality, township, or county as required by this Section.  

If the corporate authorities, township board, or the county board seek to operate the aggregation program as an opt-out program for residential and small commercial retail customers, then prior to the adoption of an ordinance with respect to aggregation of residential and small commercial retail electric loads, the corporate authorities of a municipality, the township board, or the county board of a county shall submit a referendum to its residents to determine whether or not the aggregation program shall operate as an opt-out program for residential and small commercial retail customers. Any county board that seeks to submit such a referendum to its residents shall do so only in unincorporated areas of the county where no electric aggregation ordinance has been adopted.  

In addition to the notice and conduct requirements of the general election law, notice of the referendum shall state briefly the purpose of the referendum. The question of whether the corporate authorities, the township board, or the county board shall adopt an opt-out aggregation program for residential and small commercial retail customers shall be submitted to the electors of the municipality, township board, or county board at a regular election and approved by a majority of the electors voting on the question. The corporate authorities, township board, or county board must certify to the proper election authority, which must submit the question at an election in accordance with the Election Code.  

The election authority must submit the question in substantially the following form:  

Shall the (municipality, township, or county in which the question is being voted upon) have the authority to arrange for the supply of electricity for its residential and small commercial retail customers who have not opted out of such program?  

The election authority must record the votes as "Yes" or "No".  

If a majority of the electors voting on the question vote in the affirmative, then the corporate authorities, township board, or county board may implement an opt-out aggregation program for residential and small commercial retail customers.  

A referendum must pass in each particular municipality, township, or county that is engaged in the aggregation program. If the referendum fails, then the corporate authorities, township board, or county board shall operate the aggregation program as an opt-in program for residential and small commercial retail customers.  

An ordinance under this Section shall specify whether the aggregation will occur only with the prior consent of each person owning, occupying, controlling, or using an electric load center proposed to be aggregated. Nothing in this Section, however, authorizes the aggregation of electric loads that are served or authorized to be served by an electric cooperative as defined by and pursuant to the Electric Supplier Act or loads served by a municipality that owns and operates its own electric distribution system. No aggregation shall take effect unless approved by a majority of the members of the corporate authority, township board, or county board voting upon the ordinance.  

A governmental aggregator under this Section is not a public utility or an alternative retail electric supplier.  

For purposes of this Section, "township" means the portion of a township that is an unincorporated portion of a county that is not otherwise a part of a municipality. In addition to such other limitations as are included in this Section, a township board shall only have authority to aggregate residential and small commercial customer loads in accordance with this Section if the county board of the county in which the township is located (i) is not also submitting a referendum to its residents at the same general election that the township board proposes to submit a referendum under this subsection (a), (ii) has not received authorization through passage of a referendum to operate an opt-out aggregation program for residential and small commercial retail customers under this subsection (a), and (iii) has not otherwise enacted an ordinance under this subsection (a) authorizing the operation of an opt-in aggregation program for residential and small commercial retail customers as described in this Section.  

(b) Upon the applicable requisite authority under this Section, the corporate authorities, the township board, or the county board, with assistance from the Illinois Power Agency, shall develop a plan of operation and governance for the aggregation program so authorized. Before adopting a plan under this Section, the corporate authorities, township board, or county board shall hold at least 2 public hearings on the plan. Before the first hearing, the corporate authorities, township board, or county board shall publish notice of the hearings once a week for 2 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the jurisdiction. The notice shall summarize the plan and state the date, time, and location of each hearing. Any load aggregation plan established pursuant to this Section shall:  

(1) provide for universal access to all applicable residential customers and equitable treatment of applicable residential customers; (2) describe demand management and energy efficiency services to be provided to each class of customers; and (3) meet any requirements established by law concerning aggregated service offered pursuant to this Section. (c) The process for soliciting bids for electricity and other related services and awarding proposed agreements for e purchase of electricity and other related services shall conducted in the following order:  

(1) The corporate authorities, township board, or county board may solicit bids for electricity and other related services. The bid specifications may include a provision requiring the bidder to disclose the fuel type of electricity to be procured or generated on behalf of the aggregation program customers. The corporate authorities, township board, or county board may consider the proposed source of electricity to be procured or generated to be put into the grid on behalf of aggregation program customers in the competitive bidding process. The Agency and Commission may collaborate to issue joint guidance on voluntary uniform standards for bidder disclosures of the source of electricity to be procured or generated to be put into the grid on behalf of aggregation program customers.  

(1.5) A township board shall request from the electric utility those residential and small commercial customers within their aggregate area either by zip code or zip codes or other means as determined by the electric utility. The electric utility shall then provide to the township board the residential and small commercial customers, including the names and addresses of residential and small commercial customers, electronically. The township board shall be responsible for authenticating the residential and small commercial customers contained in this listing and providing edits of the data to affirm, add, or delete the residential and small commercial customers located within its jurisdiction. The township board shall provide the edited list to the electric utility in an electronic format or other means selected by the electric utility and certify that the information is accurate.  

(2) Notwithstanding Section 16-122 of the Public Utilities Act and Section 2HH of the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, an electric utility that provides residential and small commercial retail electric service in the aggregate area must, upon request of the corporate authorities, township board, or the county board in the aggregate area, submit to the requesting party, in an electronic format, those account numbers, names, and addresses of residential and small commercial retail customers in the aggregate area that are reflected in the electric utility's records at the time of the request; provided, however, that any township board has first provided an accurate customer list to the electric utility as provided for herein.

(220 ILCS 5/4-604.5 new)  

Sec. 4-604.5. Restitution for misconduct.  

(a) It is the policy of this State that public utility ethical and criminal misconduct shall not be tolerated. The General Assembly finds it necessary to collect restitution, to be distributed as described in subsection (e), from a public utility that has been found guilty of violations of criminal law or that has entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement that details violations of criminal law that result in harm to  

ratepayers.  

(b) In light of such violations, the Illinois Commerce Commission shall, within 150 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, initiate an investigation as to whether Commonwealth Edison collected, spent, allocated, transferred, remitted, or caused in any other way to be expended ratepayer funds in connection with the conduct detailed in the Deferred Prosecution Agreement of July 16, 2020 between the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois and Commonwealth Edison. The investigation shall also determine whether any ratepayer funds were used to pay the criminal penalty agreed to in the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The investigation shall determine whether the public utility collected, spent, allocated, transferred, remitted, or caused in any other way to be expended ratepayer funds that were not lawfully recoverable through rates, and which should accordingly be refunded to ratepayers and calculate such benefits to initiate a refund to ratepayers as a result of such conduct. The investigation shall conclude no later than 330 days following initiation and shall be conducted as a contested case, as defined in Section 1-30 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act.  

(c) If regulated entities are found guilty of criminal conduct, the Commission may initiate an investigation, impose penalties, order restitution and such other remedies it deems necessary, and initiate refunds to ratepayers as described in subsection (b). Such investigation and proceeding may commence within 150 days of a finding of guilt. Any funds collected pursuant to this subsection shall be distributed as described in subsection (e). The Commission may order any other remedies it deems necessary.  

(d) Pursuant to subsection (e), the investigation shall calculate a schedule for remittance to State funds and to ratepayers, over a period of no more than 4 years, to be paid by the public utility from profits, returns, or shareholder dollars. No costs related to the investigation or contested proceeding authorized by this Section, restitution, or refunds may be recoverable through rates.  

(e) Funds collected pursuant to this Section, for the purposes of restitution, shall be repaid by the public utility as a per therm or per-kilowatt-hour credit to the public utility's ratepayers as a separate line item on the utility bill.  

(f) No public utility may use ratepayer funds to pay a criminal penalty imposed by any local, State, or federal law enforcement entity or court.  

(g) Any penalties, restitution, refunds, or remedies provided for in this Section are in addition to and not a substitution for other remedies that may be provided for by law.  

Sec. 4-605. Reliability mitigation plan findings. The General Assembly finds that reducing carbon dioxide and copollutant emissions in a manner that does not threaten electric reliability and resource adequacy is essential to the health and safety of all Illinois citizens. Therefore, the Commission shall review reliability mitigation plans filed pursuant to Section 9.15 of the Environmental Protection Act to ensure adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and environmentally sustainable electric service is available to ratepayers by approving reliability mitigation plans that permit the Illinois Pollution Control Board to enforce emission reductions in a manner that preserves reliability and resource adequacy in wholesale and retail electricity markets.

Sec. 5-117. Supplier diversity goals.  

(a) The public policy of this State is to collaboratively work with companies that serve Illinois residents to improve their supplier diversity in a non-antagonistic manner.  

(b) The Commission shall require all gas, electric, and water companies with at least 100,000 customers under its authority, as well as suppliers of wind energy, solar energy, hydroelectricity, nuclear energy, and any other supplier of energy within this State other than wind energy and solar energy required to comply with the reporting requirements under Section 1505-215 of the Department of Labor Law of the  

Civil Administrative Code of Illinois, to submit an annual report by April 15, 2015 and every April 15 thereafter, in a searchable Adobe PDF format, on all procurement goals and actual spending for female-owned, minority-owned, veteran-owned, and small business enterprises in the previous calendar year. These goals shall be expressed as a percentage of the total work performed by the entity submitting the report, and the actual spending for all female-owned, minority-owned, veteran-owned, and small business enterprises shall also be expressed as a percentage of the total work performed by the entity submitting the report.  

(c) Each participating company in its annual report shall include the following information:  

(1) an explanation of the plan for the next year to increase participation;  

(2) an explanation of the plan to increase the goals;  

(3) the areas of procurement each company shall be actively seeking more participation in in the next year;  

(4) an outline of the plan to alert and encourage potential vendors in that area to seek business from the company;  

(5) an explanation of the challenges faced in finding quality vendors and offer any suggestions for what the Commission could do to be helpful to identify those vendors;  

(6) a list of the certifications the company  

recognizes;  

(7) the point of contact for any potential vendor who wishes to do business with the company and explain the process for a vendor to enroll with the company as a minority-owned, women-owned, or veteran-owned company; and (8) any particular success stories to encourage other companies to emulate best practices.  

(d) Each annual report shall include as much State-specific data as possible. If the submitting entity does not submit State-specific data, then the company shall include any national data it does have and explain why it could not submit State-specific data and how it intends to do so in future reports, if possible.  

(e) Each annual report shall include the rules, regulations, and definitions used for the procurement goals in the company's annual report.  

(f) The Commission and all participating entities shall hold an annual workshop open to the public in 2015 and every year thereafter on the state of supplier diversity to collaboratively seek solutions to structural impediments to achieving stated goals, including testimony from each participating entity as well as subject matter experts and advocates. The Commission shall publish a database on its website of the point of contact for each participating entity for supplier diversity, along with a list of certifications each company recognizes from the information submitted in each

Sec. 8-103B. Energy efficiency and demand-response measures.  

(a) It is the policy of the State that electric utilities are required to use cost-effective energy efficiency and demand-response measures to reduce delivery load. Requiring investment in cost-effective energy efficiency and demand-response measures will reduce direct and indirect costs to consumers by decreasing environmental impacts and by avoiding or delaying the need for new generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. It serves the public interest to allow electric utilities to recover costs for reasonably and prudently incurred expenditures for energy efficiency and demand-response measures. As used in this Section, "cost-effective" means that the measures satisfy the total resource cost test. The low-income measures described in subsection (c) of this Section shall not be required to meet the total resource cost test. For purposes of this Section, the terms "energy-efficiency", "demand-response", "electric utility", and "total resource cost test" have the meanings set forth in the Illinois Power Agency Act. "Black, indigenous, and people of color" and "BIPOC" means people who are members of the groups described in subparagraphs (a) through (e) of paragraph (A) of subsection (1) of Section 2 of the Business Enterprise for Minorities, Women, and Persons with Disabilities Act.  

(a-5) This Section applies to electric utilities serving more than 500,000 retail customers in the State for those multi-year plans commencing after December 31, 2017.  

(b) For purposes of this Section, electric utilities subject to this Section that serve more than 3,000,000 retail customers in the State shall be deemed to have achieved a cumulative persisting annual savings of 6.6% from energy efficiency measures and programs implemented during the period beginning January 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2017, which percent is based on the deemed average weather normalized sales of electric power and energy during calendar years 2014, 2015, and 2016 of 88,000,000 MWhs. For the purposes of this subsection (b) and subsection (b-5), the 88,000,000 MWhs of deemed electric power and energy sales shall be reduced by the number of MWhs equal to the sum of the annual consumption of customers that have opted out of are exempt from subsections (a) through (j) of this Section under paragraph (1) of subsection (l) of this Section, as averaged across the calendar years 2014, 2015, and 2016. After 2017, the deemed value of cumulative persisting annual savings from energy efficiency measures and programs implemented during the period beginning January 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2017, shall be reduced each year, as follows, and the applicable value shall be applied to and count toward the utility's achievement of the cumulative persisting annual savings goals set forth in subsection (b-5):  

(1) 5.8% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2018; (2) 5.2% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2019; (3) 4.5% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2020; (4) 4.0% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2021; (5) 3.5% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2022; (6) 3.1% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2023; (7) 2.8% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2024; (8) 2.5% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2025; (9) 2.3% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2026; (10) 2.1% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2027;  

(11) 1.8% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings   
for the year ending December 31, 2028; (12) 1.7% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings   
for the year ending December 31, 2029; and (13) 1.5% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings   
for the year ending December 31, 2030;. (14) 1.3% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings   
for the year ending December 31, 2031; (15) 1.1% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings   
for the year ending December 31, 2032; (16) 0.9% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings   
for the year ending December 31, 2033; (17) 0.7% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings   
for the year ending December 31, 2034; (18) 0.5% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings   
for the year ending December 31, 2035; (19) 0.4% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings   
for the year ending December 31, 2036; (20) 0.3% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings   
for the year ending December 31, 2037; (21) 0.2% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings   
for the year ending December 31, 2038; (22) 0.1% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings   
for the year ending December 31, 2039; and (23) 0.0% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings   
for the year ending December 31, 2040 and all subsequent  

years.  

For purposes of this Section, "cumulative persisting annual savings" means the total electric energy savings in a given year from measures installed in that year or in previous years, but no earlier than January 1, 2012, that are still operational and providing savings in that year because the measures have not yet reached the end of their useful lives.  

(b-5) Beginning in 2018, electric utilities subject to this Section that serve more than 3,000,000 retail customers in the State shall achieve the following cumulative persisting annual savings goals, as modified by subsection (f) of this Section and as compared to the deemed baseline of 88,000,000 MWhs of electric power and energy sales set forth in subsection (b), as reduced by the number of MWhs equal to the sum of the annual consumption of customers that have opted out of are exempt from subsections (a) through (j) of this Section under paragraph (1) of subsection (l) of this Section as averaged across the calendar years 2014, 2015, and 2016, through the implementation of energy efficiency measures during the applicable year and in prior years, but no earlier than January 1, 2012:  

(1) 7.8% cumulative persisting annual savings for the   
year ending December 31, 2018; (2) 9.1% cumulative persisting annual savings for the   
year ending December 31, 2019; (3) 10.4% cumulative persisting annual savings for the  

year ending December 31, 2020;  

(4) 11.8% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2021; (5) 13.1% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2022; (6) 14.4% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2023; (7) 15.7% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2024; (8) 17% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2025; (9) 17.9% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2026; (10) 18.8% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2027; (11) 19.7% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2028; (12) 20.6% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2029; and (13) 21.5% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2030.  

No later than December 31, 2021, the Illinois Commerce Commission shall establish additional cumulative persisting annual savings goals for the years 2031 through 2035. No later than December 31, 2024, the Illinois Commerce Commission shall establish additional cumulative persisting annual savings goals for the years 2036 through 2040. The Commission shall also establish additional cumulative persisting annual savings goals every 5 years thereafter to ensure that utilities always have goals that extend at least 11 years into the future. The cumulative persisting annual savings goals beyond the year 2030 shall increase by 0.9 percentage points per year, absent a Commission decision to initiate a proceeding to consider establishing goals that increase by more or less than that amount. Such a proceeding must be conducted in accordance with the procedures described in subsection (f) of this Section. If such a proceeding is initiated, the cumulative persisting annual savings goals established by the Commission through that proceeding shall reflect the Commission's best estimate of the maximum amount of additional savings that are forecast to be cost-effectively achievable unless such best estimates would result in goals that represent less than 0.5 percentage point annual increases in total cumulative persisting annual savings. The Commission may only establish goals that represent less than 0.5 percentage point annual increases in cumulative persisting annual savings if it can demonstrate, based on clear and convincing evidence and through independent analysis, that 0.5 percentage point increases are not cost-effectively achievable. The Commission shall inform its decision based on an energy efficiency potential study that conforms to the requirements of this Section.  

(b-10) For purposes of this Section, electric utilities subject to this Section that serve less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State shall be deemed to have achieved a cumulative persisting annual savings of 6.6% from energy efficiency measures and programs implemented during the period beginning January 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2017, which is based on the deemed average weather normalized sales of electric power and energy during calendar years 2014, 2015, and 2016 of 36,900,000 MWhs. For the purposes of this subsection (b-10) and subsection (b-15), the 36,900,000 MWhs of deemed electric power and energy sales shall be reduced by the number of MWhs equal to the sum of the annual consumption of customers that have opted out of are exempt from subsections (a) through (j) of this Section under paragraph (1) of subsection (l) of this Section, as averaged across the calendar years 2014, 2015, and 2016. After 2017, the deemed value of cumulative persisting annual savings from energy efficiency measures and programs implemented during the period beginning January 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2017, shall be reduced each year, as follows, and the applicable value shall be applied to and count toward the utility's achievement of the cumulative persisting annual savings goals set forth in subsection (b-15):  

(1) 5.8% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2018; (2) 5.2% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings  

SB2408 Enrolled LRB102 11366 BMS 16699 b for the year ending December 31, 2019; (3) 4.5% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2020; (4) 4.0% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2021; (5) 3.5% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2022; (6) 3.1% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2023; (7) 2.8% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2024; (8) 2.5% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2025; (9) 2.3% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2026; (10) 2.1% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2027; (11) 1.8% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2028; (12) 1.7% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2029; and (13) 1.5% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2030;. (14) 1.3% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2031; (15) 1.1% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings

for the year ending December 31, 2039; and (23) 0.0% deemed cumulative persisting annual savings   
for the year ending December 31, 2040 and all subsequent   
years.  

(b-15) Beginning in 2018, electric utilities subject to this Section that serve less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State shall achieve the following cumulative persisting annual savings goals, as modified by subsection (b-20) and subsection (f) of this Section and as compared to the deemed baseline as reduced by the number of MWhs equal to the sum of the annual consumption of customers that have opted out of are exempt from subsections (a) through (j) of this Section under paragraph (1) of subsection (l) of this Section as averaged across the calendar years 2014, 2015, and 2016, through the implementation of energy efficiency measures during the applicable year and in prior years, but no earlier than January 1, 2012:  

(1) 7.4% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2018; (2) 8.2% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2019; (3) 9.0% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2020; (4) 9.8% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2021; (5) 10.6% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2022; (6) 11.4% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2023; (7) 12.2% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2024; (8) $13\%$ cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2025; (9) 13.6% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2026; (10) 14.2% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2027;  

(11) 14.8% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2028;  

(12) 15.4% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2029; and  

(13) 16% cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2030.  

No later than December 31, 2021, the Illinois Commerce Commission shall establish additional cumulative persisting annual savings goals for the years 2031 through 2035. No later than December 31, 2024, the Illinois Commerce Commission shall establish additional cumulative persisting annual savings goals for the years 2036 through 2040. The Commission shall also establish additional cumulative persisting annual savings goals every 5 years thereafter to ensure that utilities always have goals that extend at least 11 years into the future. The cumulative persisting annual savings goals beyond the year 2030 shall increase by 0.6 percentage points per year, absent a Commission decision to initiate a proceeding to consider establishing goals that increase by more or less than that amount. Such a proceeding must be conducted in accordance with the procedures described in subsection (f) of this Section. If such a proceeding is initiated, the cumulative persisting annual savings goals established by the Commission through that proceeding shall reflect the Commission's best estimate of the maximum amount of additional savings that are forecast to be cost-effectively achievable unless such best estimates would result in goals that represent less than 0.4 percentage point annual increases in total cumulative persisting annual savings. The Commission may only establish goals that represent less than 0.4 percentage point annual increases in cumulative persisting annual savings if it can demonstrate, based on clear and convincing evidence and through independent analysis, that 0.4 percentage point increases are not cost-effectively achievable. The Commission shall inform its decision based on an energy efficiency potential study that conforms to the requirements of this Section.  

The difference between the cumulative persisting annual savings goal for the applicable calendar year and the cumulative persisting annual savings goal for the immediately preceding calendar year is 0.8% for the period of January 1, 2018 through December and 0.6% for the period of January 1, 2026 through December 31, 2030.  

(b-20) Each electric utility subject to this Section may include cost-effective voltage optimization measures in its plans submitted under subsections (f) and (g) of this Section, and the costs incurred by a utility to implement the measures under a Commission-approved plan shall be recovered under the provisions of Article IX or Section 16-108.5 of this Act. For purposes of this Section, the measure life of voltage optimization measures shall be 15 years. The measure life period is independent of the depreciation rate of the voltage optimization assets deployed. Utilities may claim savings from voltage optimization on circuits for more than 15 years if they can demonstrate that they have made additional investments necessary to enable voltage optimization savings to continue beyond 15 years. Such demonstrations must be subject to the review of independent evaluation.  

Within 270 days after June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906), an electric utility that serves less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State shall file a plan with the Commission that identifies the cost-effective voltage optimization investment the electric utility plans to undertake through December 31, 2024. The Commission, after notice and hearing, shall approve or approve with modification the plan within 120 days after the plan's filing and, in the order approving or approving with modification the plan, the Commission shall adjust the applicable cumulative persisting annual savings goals set forth in subsection (b-15) to reflect any amount of cost-effective energy savings approved by the Commission that is greater than or less than the following cumulative persisting annual savings values attributable to voltage optimization for the applicable year:  

(1) 0.0% of cumulative persisting annual savings for   
the year ending December 31, 2018; (2) 0.17% of cumulative persisting annual savings for   
the year ending December 31, 2019; (3) 0.17% of cumulative persisting annual savings for  

the year ending December 31, 2020;  

(4) 0.33% of cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2021; (5) 0.5% of cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2022; (6) 0.67% of cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2023; (7) $0.83\%$ of cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2024; and (8) 1.0% of cumulative persisting annual savings for the year ending December 31, 2025 and all subsequent years.  

(b-25) In the event an electric utility jointly offers an energy efficiency measure or program with a gas utility under plans approved under this Section and Section 8-104 of this Act, the electric utility may continue offering the program, including the gas energy efficiency measures, in the event the gas utility discontinues funding the program. In that event, the energy savings value associated with such other fuels shall be converted to electric energy savings on an equivalent Btu basis for the premises. However, the electric utility shall prioritize programs for low-income residential customers to the extent practicable. An electric utility may recover the costs of offering the gas energy efficiency measures under this subsection (b-25).  

For those energy efficiency measures or programs that save both electricity and other fuels but are not jointly offered with a gas utility under plans approved under this Section and Section 8-104 or not offered with an affiliated gas utility under paragraph (6) of subsection (f) of Section 8-104 of this Act, the electric utility may count savings of fuels other than electricity toward the achievement of its annual savings goal, and the energy savings value associated with such other fuels shall be converted to electric energy savings on an equivalent Btu basis at the premises.  

In no event shall more than 10% of each year's applicable annual total savings requirement incremental goal as defined in paragraph (7.5) (7) of subsection (g) of this Section be met through savings of fuels other than electricity.  

(b-27) Beginning in 2022, an electric utility may offer and promote measures that electrify space heating, water heating, cooling, drying, cooking, industrial processes, and other building and industrial end uses that would otherwise be served by combustion of fossil fuel at the premises, provided that the electrification measures reduce total energy consumption at the premises. The electric utility may count the reduction in energy consumption at the premises toward achievement of its annual savings goals. The reduction in energy consumption at the premises shall be calculated as the difference between: (A) the reduction in Btu consumption of fossil fuels as a result of electrification, converted to kilowatt-hour equivalents by dividing by 3,412 Btu's per kilowatt hour; and (B) the increase in kilowatt hours of electricity consumption resulting from the displacement of fossil fuel consumption as a result of electrification. An electric utility may recover the costs of offering and promoting electrification measures under this subsection (b-27).  

In no event shall electrification savings counted toward each year's applicable annual total savings requirement, as defined in paragraph (7.5) of subsection (g) of this Section, be greater than:  

(1) 5% per year for each year from 2022 through 2025; (2) 10% per year for each year from 2026 through 2029; and (3) 15% per year for 2030 and all subsequent years.  

In addition, a minimum of 25% of all electrification savings counted toward a utility's applicable annual total savings requirement must be from electrification of end uses in low-income housing. The limitations on electrification savings that may be counted toward a utility's annual savings goals are separate from and in addition to the subsection (b-25) limitations governing the counting of the other fuel savings resulting from efficiency measures and programs.  

As part of the annual informational filing to the Commission that is required under paragraph (9) of subsection (g) of this Section, each utility shall identify the specific electrification measures offered under this subjection (b-27);  

the quantity of each electrification measure that was installed by its customers; the average total cost, average utility cost, average reduction in fossil fuel consumption, and average increase in electricity consumption associated with each electrification measure; the portion of installations of each electrification measure that were in low-income single-family housing, low-income multifamily housing, non-low-income single-family housing, non-low-income multifamily housing, commercial buildings, and industrial facilities; and the quantity of savings associated with each measure category in each customer category that are being counted toward the utility's applicable annual total savings requirement. Prior to installing an electrification measure, the utility shall provide a customer with an estimate of the impact of the new measure on the customer's average monthly electric bill and total annual energy expenses.  

(c) Electric utilities shall be responsible for overseeing the design, development, and filing of energy efficiency plans with the Commission and may, as part of that implementation, outsource various aspects of program development and implementation. A minimum of $10\%$ , for electric utilities that serve more than 3,000,000 retail customers in the State, and a minimum of 7%, for electric utilities that serve less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State, of the utility's entire portfolio funding level for a given year shall be used to procure cost-effective energy efficiency measures from units of local government, municipal corporations, school districts, public housing, and community college districts, provided that a minimum percentage of available funds shall be used to procure energy efficiency from public housing, which percentage shall be equal to public housing's share of public building energy consumption.  

The utilities shall also implement energy efficiency measures targeted at low-income households, which, for purposes of this Section, shall be defined as households at or below $80\%$ of area median income, and expenditures to implement the measures shall be no less than \$40,000,000 \$25,000,000 per year for electric utilities that serve more than 3,000,000 retail customers in the State and no less than \$13,000,000 \$8,350,000 per year for electric utilities that serve less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State. The ratio of spending on efficiency programs targeted at low-income multifamily buildings to spending on efficiency programs targeted at low-income single-family buildings shall be designed to achieve levels of savings from each building type that are approximately proportional to the magnitude of cost-effective lifetime savings potential in each building type. Investment in low-income whole-building weatherization programs shall constitute a minimum of 80% of a utility's total budget specifically dedicated to serving low-income customers.  

The utilities shall work to bundle low-income energy efficiency offerings with other programs that serve low-income households to maximize the benefits going to these households. The utilities shall market and implement low-income energy efficiency programs in coordination with low-income assistance programs, the Illinois Solar for All Program, and weatherization whenever practicable. The program implementer shall walk the customer through the enrollment process for any programs for which the customer is eligible. The utilities shall also pilot targeting customers with high arrearages, high energy intensity (ratio of energy usage divided by home or unit square footage), or energy assistance programs with energy efficiency offerings, and then track reduction in arrearages as a result of the targeting. This targeting and bundling of low-income energy programs shall be offered to both low-income single-family and multifamily customers (owners and residents).  

The utilities shall invest in health and safety measures appropriate and necessary for comprehensively weatherizing a home or multifamily building, and shall implement a health and safety fund of at least 15% of the total income-qualified weatherization budget that shall be used for the purpose of making grants for technical assistance, construction, reconstruction, improvement, or repair of buildings to facilitate their participation in the energy efficiency programs targeted at low-income single-family and multifamily households. These funds may also be used for the purpose of making grants for technical assistance, construction, reconstruction, improvement, or repair of the following buildings to facilitate their participation in the energy efficiency programs created by this Section: (1) buildings that are owned or operated by registered 501(c)(3) public charities; and (2) day care centers, day care homes, or group day care homes, as defined under 89 Ill. Adm. Code Part 406, 407, or 408, respectively.  

Each electric utility shall assess opportunities to implement cost-effective energy efficiency measures and programs through a public housing authority or authorities located in its service territory. If such opportunities are identified, the utility shall propose such measures and programs to address the opportunities. Expenditures to address such opportunities shall be credited toward the minimum procurement and expenditure requirements set forth in this subsection (c).  

Implementation of energy efficiency measures and programs targeted at low-income households should be contracted, when it is practicable, to independent third parties that have demonstrated capabilities to serve such households, with a preference for not-for-profit entities and government agencies that have existing relationships with or experience serving low-income communities in the State.  

Each electric utility shall develop and implement reporting procedures that address and assist in determining the amount of energy savings that can be applied to the low-income procurement and expenditure requirements set forth in this subsection (c). Each electric utility shall also track the types and quantities or volumes of insulation and air sealing materials, and their associated energy saving benefits, installed in energy efficiency programs targeted at low-income single-family and multifamily households.  

The electric utilities shall participate in also convene a low-income energy efficiency accountability advisory committee ("the committee"), which will directly inform to assist in the design, implementation, and evaluation of the low-income and public-housing energy efficiency programs. The committee shall be comprised of the electric utilities subject to the requirements of this Section, the gas utilities subject to the requirements of Section 8-104 of this Act, the utilities' low-income energy efficiency implementation contractors, nonprofit organizations, community action agencies, advocacy groups, State and local governmental agencies, public-housing organizations, and representatives of community-based organizations, especially those living in or working with environmental justice communities and BIPOC communities. The committee shall be composed of 2 geographically differentiated subcommittees: one for stakeholders in northern Illinois and one for stakeholders in central and southern Illinois. The subcommittees shall meet together at least twice per year.  

There shall be one statewide leadership committee led by and composed of community-based organizations that are representative of BIPOC and environmental justice communities and that includes equitable representation from BIPOC communities. The leadership committee shall be composed of an equal number of representatives from the 2 subcommittees. The subcommittees shall address specific programs and issues, with the leadership committee convening targeted workgroups as needed. The leadership committee may elect to work with an independent facilitator to solicit and organize feedback, recommendations and meeting participation from a wide variety of community-based stakeholders. If a facilitator is used, they shall be fair and responsive to the needs of all stakeholders involved in the committee.  

All committee meetings must be accessible, with rotating locations if meetings are held in-person, virtual participation options, and materials and agendas circulated in advance.  

There shall also be opportunities for direct input by committee members outside of committee meetings, such as via individual meetings, surveys, emails and calls, to ensure robust participation by stakeholders with limited capacity and ability to attend committee meetings. Committee meetings shall emphasize opportunities to bundle and coordinate delivery of low-income energy efficiency with other programs that serve low-income communities, such as the Illinois Solar for All  

Program and bill payment assistance programs. Meetings shall include educational opportunities for stakeholders to learn more about these additional offerings, and the committee shall assist in figuring out the best methods for coordinated delivery and implementation of offerings when serving low-income communities. The committee shall directly and equitably influence and inform utility low-income and public-housing energy efficiency programs and priorities. Participating utilities shall implement recommendations from the committee whenever possible.  

Participating utilities shall track and report how input from the committee has led to new approaches and changes in their energy efficiency portfolios. This reporting shall occur at committee meetings and in quarterly energy efficiency reports to the Stakeholder Advisory Group and Illinois Commerce Commission, and other relevant reporting mechanisms. Participating utilities shall also report on relevant equity data and metrics requested by the committee, such as energy burden data, geographic, racial, and other relevant demographic data on where programs are being delivered and what populations programs are serving.  

The Illinois Commerce Commission shall oversee and have relevant staff participate in the committee. The committee shall have a budget of 0.25% of each utility's entire efficiency portfolio funding for a given year. The budget shall be overseen by the Commission. The budget shall be used to provide grants for community-based organizations serving on the leadership committee, stipends for community-based organizations participating in the committee, grants for community-based organizations to do energy efficiency outreach and education, and relevant meeting needs as determined by the leadership committee. The education and outreach shall include, but is not limited to, basic energy efficiency education, information about low-income energy efficiency programs, and information on the committee's purpose, structure, and activities.  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a utility providing approved energy efficiency measures and, if applicable, demand-response measures in the State shall be permitted to recover all reasonable and prudently incurred costs of those measures from all retail customers, except as provided in subsection (l) of this Section, as follows, provided that nothing in this subsection (d) permits the double recovery of such costs from customers:  

(1) The utility may recover its costs through an automatic adjustment clause tariff filed with and approved by the Commission. The tariff shall be established outside the context of a general rate case. Each year the Commission shall initiate a review to reconcile any amounts collected with the actual costs and to determine the required adjustment to the annual tariff factor to match annual expenditures. To enable the financing of the incremental capital expenditures, including regulatory assets, for electric utilities that serve less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State, the utility's actual year-end capital structure that includes a common equity ratio, excluding goodwill, of up to and including $50\%$ of the total capital structure shall be deemed reasonable and used to set rates.  

(2) A utility may recover its costs through an energy efficiency formula rate approved by the Commission under a filing under subsections (f) and (g) of this Section, which shall specify the cost components that form the basis of the rate charged to customers with sufficient specificity to operate in a standardized manner and be updated annually with transparent information that reflects the utility's actual costs to be recovered during the applicable rate year, which is the period beginning with the first billing day of January and extending through the last billing day of the following December. The energy efficiency formula rate shall be implemented through a tariff filed with the Commission under subsections (f) and (g) of this Section that is consistent with the provisions of this paragraph (2) and that shall be applicable to all delivery services customers. The Commission shall conduct an investigation of the tariff in a manner consistent with the provisions of this paragraph (2), subsections (f) and (g) of this Section, and the provisions of Article IX of this Act to the extent they do not conflict with this paragraph (2). The energy efficiency formula rate approved by the Commission shall remain in effect at the discretion of the utility and shall do the following:  

(A) Provide for the recovery of the utility's actual costs incurred under this Section that are prudently incurred and reasonable in amount consistent with Commission practice and law. The sole fact that a cost differs from that incurred in a prior calendar year or that an investment is different from that made in a prior calendar year shall not imply the imprudence or unreasonableness of that cost or investment.  

(B) Reflect the utility's actual year-end capital structure for the applicable calendar year, excluding goodwill, subject to a determination of prudence and reasonableness consistent with Commission practice and law. To enable the financing of the incremental capital expenditures, including regulatory assets, for electric utilities that serve less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State, a participating electric utility's actual year-end capital structure that includes a common equity ratio, excluding goodwill, of up to and including $50\%$ of the total capital structure shall be deemed reasonable and used to set rates.  

(C) Include a cost of equity, which shall be calculated as the sum of the following:  

(i) the average for the applicable calendar   
year of the monthly average yields of 30-year U.S.   
Treasury bonds published by the Board of Governors   
of the Federal Reserve System in its weekly H.15   
Statistical Release or successor publication; and (ii) 580 basis points.  

At such time as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ceases to include the monthly average yields of 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds in its weekly H.15 Statistical Release or successor publication, the monthly average yields of the U.S. Treasury bonds then having the longest duration published by the Board of Governors in its weekly H.15 Statistical Release or successor publication shall instead be used for purposes of this paragraph (2).  

(D) Permit and set forth protocols, subject to a determination of prudence and reasonableness consistent with Commission practice and law, for the following:  

(i) recovery of incentive compensation expense that is based on the achievement of operational metrics, including metrics related to budget controls, outage duration and frequency, safety, customer service, efficiency and productivity, and environmental compliance; however, this protocol shall not apply if such expense related to costs incurred under this Section is recovered under Article IX or Section 16-108.5 of this Act; incentive compensation expense that is based on net income or an affiliate's earnings per share shall not be recoverable under the energy efficiency formula rate;  

(ii) recovery of pension and other post-employment benefits expense, provided that such costs are supported by an actuarial study; however, this protocol shall not apply if such expense related to costs incurred under this Section is recovered under Article IX or Section 16-108.5 of this Act;  

(iii) recovery of existing regulatory assets over the periods previously authorized by the Commission;  

(iv) as described in subsection (e), amortization of costs incurred under this Section; and  

(v) projected, weather normalized billing determinants for the applicable rate year.  

(E) Provide for an annual reconciliation, as described in paragraph (3) of this subsection (d), less any deferred taxes related to the reconciliation, with interest at an annual rate of return equal to the utility's weighted average cost of capital, including a revenue conversion factor calculated to recover or refund all additional income taxes that may be payable or receivable as a result of that return, of the energy efficiency revenue requirement reflected in rates for each calendar year, beginning with the calendar year in which the utility files its energy efficiency formula rate tariff under this paragraph (2), with what the revenue requirement would have been had the actual cost information for the applicable calendar year been available at the filing date.  

The utility shall file, together with its tariff, the projected costs to be incurred by the utility during the rate year under the utility's multi-year plan approved under subsections (f) and (g) of this Section, including, but not limited to, the projected capital investment costs and projected regulatory asset balances with correspondingly updated depreciation and amortization reserves and expense, that shall populate the energy efficiency formula rate and set the initial rates under the formula.  

The Commission shall review the proposed tariff in conjunction with its review of a proposed multi-year plan, as specified in paragraph (5) of subsection (g) of this Section. The review shall be based on the same evidentiary standards, including, but not limited to, those concerning the prudence and reasonableness of the costs incurred by the utility, the Commission applies in a hearing to review a filing for a general increase in rates under Article IX of this Act. The initial rates shall take effect beginning with the January monthly billing period following the Commission's approval.  

The tariff's rate design and cost allocation across customer classes shall be consistent with the utility's automatic adjustment clause tariff in effect on June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906); however, the Commission may revise the tariff's rate design and cost allocation in subsequent proceedings under paragraph (3) of this subsection (d).  

If the energy efficiency formula rate is terminated, the then current rates shall remain in effect until such time as the energy efficiency costs are incorporated into new rates that are set under this subsection (d) or Article IX of this Act, subject to retroactive rate adjustment, with interest, to reconcile rates charged with actual costs.  

(3) The provisions of this paragraph (3) shall only apply to an electric utility that has elected to file an energy efficiency formula rate under paragraph (2) of this subsection (d). Subsequent to the Commission's issuance of an order approving the utility's energy efficiency formula rate structure and protocols, and initial rates under paragraph (2) of this subsection (d), the utility shall file, on or before June 1 of each year, with the Chief Clerk of the Commission its updated cost inputs to the energy efficiency formula rate for the applicable rate year and the corresponding new charges, as well as the information described in paragraph (9) of subsection (g) of this Section. Each such filing shall conform to the following requirements and include the following information:  

(A) The inputs to the energy efficiency formula rate for the applicable rate year shall be based on the projected costs to be incurred by the utility during the rate year under the utility's multi-year plan approved under subsections (f) and (g) of this Section, including, but not limited to, projected capital investment costs and projected regulatory asset balances with correspondingly updated depreciation and amortization reserves and expense. The filing shall also include a reconciliation of the energy efficiency revenue requirement that was in effect for the prior rate year (as set by the cost inputs for the prior rate year) with the actual revenue requirement for the prior rate year (determined using a year-end rate base) that uses amounts reflected in the applicable FERC Form 1 that reports the actual costs for the prior rate year. Any over-collection or under-collection indicated by such reconciliation shall be reflected as a credit against, or recovered as an additional charge to, respectively, with interest calculated at a rate equal to the utility's weighted average cost of capital approved by the Commission for the prior rate year, the charges for the applicable rate year. Such over-collection or under-collection shall be adjusted to remove any deferred taxes related to the reconciliation, for purposes of calculating interest at an annual rate of return equal to the utility's weighted average cost of capital approved by the Commission for the prior rate year, including a revenue conversion factor calculated to recover or refund all additional income taxes that may be payable or receivable as a result of that return. Each reconciliation shall be certified by the participating utility in the same manner that FERC Form 1 is certified. The filing shall also include the charge or credit, if any, resulting from the calculation required by subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of this subsection (d).  

Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the intent of the reconciliation is to ultimately reconcile both the revenue requirement reflected in rates for each calendar year, beginning with the calendar year in which the utility files its energy efficiency formula rate tariff under paragraph (2) of this subsection (d), with what the revenue requirement determined using a year-end rate base for the applicable calendar year would have been had the actual cost information for the applicable calendar year been available at the filing date.  

For purposes of this Section, "FERC Form 1" means the Annual Report of Major Electric Utilities, Licensees and Others that electric utilities are required to file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the Federal Power Act, Sections 3, 4(a), 304 and 209, modified as necessary to be consistent with 83 Ill. Admin. Code Part 415 as of May 1, 2011. Nothing in this Section is intended to allow costs that are not otherwise recoverable to be recoverable by virtue of inclusion in FERC Form 1.  

(B) The new charges shall take effect beginning on the first billing day of the following January billing period and remain in effect through the last billing day of the next December billing period regardless of whether the Commission enters upon a hearing under this paragraph (3).  

(C) The filing shall include relevant and necessary data and documentation for the applicable rate year. Normalization adjustments shall not be required.  

Within 45 days after the utility files its annual update of cost inputs to the energy efficiency formula rate, the Commission shall with reasonable notice, initiate a proceeding concerning whether the projected costs to be incurred by the utility and recovered during the applicable rate year, and that are reflected in the inputs to the energy efficiency formula rate, are consistent with the utility's approved multi-year plan under subsections (f) and (g) of this Section and whether the costs incurred by the utility during the prior rate year were prudent and reasonable. The Commission shall also have the authority to investigate the information and data described in paragraph (9) of subsection (g) of this Section, including the proposed adjustment to the utility's return on equity component of its weighted average cost of capital. During the course of the proceeding, each objection shall be stated with particularity and evidence provided in support thereof, after which the utility shall have the opportunity to rebut the evidence. Discovery shall be allowed consistent with the Commission's Rules of Practice, which Rules of Practice shall be enforced by the Commission or the assigned administrative law judge. The Commission shall apply the same evidentiary standards, including, but not limited to, those concerning the prudence and reasonableness of the costs incurred by the utility, during the proceeding as it would apply in a proceeding to review a filing for a general increase in rates under Article IX of this Act. The Commission shall not, however, have the authority in a proceeding under this paragraph (3) to consider or order any changes to the structure or protocols of the energy efficiency formula rate approved under paragraph (2) of this subsection (d). In a proceeding under this paragraph (3), the Commission shall enter its order no later than the earlier of 195 days after the utility's filing of its annual update of cost inputs to the energy efficiency formula rate or December 15. The utility's proposed return on equity calculation, as described in paragraphs (7) through (9) of subsection (g) of this Section, shall be deemed the final, approved calculation on December 15 of the year in which it is filed unless the Commission enters an order on or before December 15, after notice and hearing, that modifies such calculation consistent with this Section. The Commission's determinations of the prudence and reasonableness of the costs incurred, and determination of such return on equity calculation, for the applicable calendar year shall be final upon entry of the Commission's order and shall not be subject to reopening, reexamination, or collateral attack in any other Commission proceeding, case, docket, order, rule, or regulation; however, nothing in this paragraph (3) shall prohibit a party from petitioning the Commission to rehear or appeal to the courts the order under the provisions of this Act.  

(e) Beginning on June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906), a utility subject to the requirements of this Section may elect to defer, as a regulatory asset, up to the full amount of its expenditures incurred under this Section for each annual period, including, but not limited to, any expenditures incurred above the funding level set by subsection (f) of this Section for a given year. The total expenditures deferred as a regulatory asset in a given year shall be amortized and recovered over a period that is equal to the weighted average of the energy efficiency measure lives implemented for that year that are reflected in the regulatory asset. The unamortized balance shall be recognized as of December 31 for a given year. The utility shall also earn a return on the total of the unamortized balances of all of the energy efficiency regulatory assets, less any deferred taxes related to those unamortized balances, at an annual rate equal to the utility's weighted average cost of capital that includes, based on a year-end capital structure, the utility's actual cost of debt for the applicable calendar year and a cost of equity, which shall be calculated as the sum of the (i) the average for the applicable calendar year of the monthly average yields of 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in its weekly H.15 Statistical Release or successor publication; and (ii) 580 basis points, including a revenue conversion factor calculated to recover or refund all additional income taxes that may be payable or receivable as a result of that return. Capital investment costs shall be depreciated and recovered over their useful lives consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. The weighted average cost of capital shall be applied to the capital investment cost balance, less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated deferred income taxes, as of December 31 for a given year.  

When an electric utility creates a regulatory asset under the provisions of this Section, the costs are recovered over a period during which customers also receive a benefit which is in the public interest. Accordingly, it is the intent of the General Assembly that an electric utility that elects to create a regulatory asset under the provisions of this Section shall recover all of the associated costs as set forth in this Section. After the Commission has approved the prudence and reasonableness of the costs that comprise the regulatory asset, the electric utility shall be permitted to recover all such costs, and the value and recoverability through rates of the associated regulatory asset shall not be limited, altered, impaired, or reduced.  

(f) Beginning in 2017, each electric utility shall file an energy efficiency plan with the Commission to meet the energy efficiency standards for the next applicable multi-year period beginning January 1 of the year following the filing, according to the schedule set forth in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subsection (f). If a utility does not file such a plan on or before the applicable filing deadline for the plan, it shall face a penalty of \$100,000 per day until the plan is filed.  

(1) No later than 30 days after June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906), each electric utility shall file a 4-year energy efficiency plan commencing on January 1, 2018 that is designed to achieve the cumulative persisting annual savings goals specified in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (b-5) of this Section or in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (b-15) of this Section, as applicable, through implementation of energy efficiency measures; however, the goals may be reduced if the utility's expenditures are limited pursuant to subsection (m) of this Section or, for a utility that serves less than 3,000,000 retail customers, if each of the following conditions are met: (A) the plan's analysis and forecasts of the utility's ability to acquire energy savings demonstrate that achievement of such goals is not cost effective; and (B) the amount of energy savings achieved by the utility as determined by the independent evaluator for the most recent year for which savings have been evaluated preceding the plan filing was less than the average annual amount of savings required to achieve the goals for the applicable 4-year plan period. Except as provided in subsection (m) of this Section, annual increases in cumulative persisting annual savings goals during the applicable 4-year plan period shall not be reduced to amounts that are less than the maximum amount of cumulative persisting annual savings that is forecast to be cost-effectively achievable during the 4-year plan period. The Commission shall review any proposed goal reduction as part of its review and approval of the utility's proposed plan.  

(2) No later than March 1, 2021, each electric utility shall file a 4-year energy efficiency plan commencing on January 1, 2022 that is designed to achieve the cumulative persisting annual savings goals specified in paragraphs (5) through (8) of subsection (b-5) of this Section or in paragraphs (5) through (8) of subsection (b-15) of this Section, as applicable, through implementation of energy efficiency measures; however, the goals may be reduced if either (1) clear and convincing evidence demonstrates, through independent analysis, that the expenditure limits in subsection (m) of this Section preclude full achievement of the goals or (2) the utility's expenditures are limited pursuant to subsection (m) of this Section or, each of the following conditions are met: (A) the plan's analysis and forecasts of the utility's ability to acquire energy savings demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence and through independent analysis that achievement of such goals is not cost effective; and (B) the amount of energy savings achieved by the utility as determined by the independent evaluator for the most recent year for which savings have been evaluated preceding the plan filing was less than the average annual amount of savings required to achieve the goals for the applicable 4-year plan period. If there is not clear and convincing evidence that achieving the savings goals specified in paragraph (b-5) or (b-15) of this Section is possible both cost-effectively and within the expenditure limits in subsection (m), such savings goals shall not be reduced. Except as provided in subsection (m) of this Section, annual increases in cumulative persisting annual savings goals during the applicable 4-year plan period shall not be reduced to amounts that are less than the maximum amount of cumulative persisting annual savings that is forecast to be cost-effectively achievable during the 4-year plan period. The Commission shall review any proposed goal reduction as part of its review and approval of the utility's proposed plan.  

(3) No later than March 1, 2025, each electric utility shall file a 4-year 5-year energy efficiency plan commencing on January 1, 2026 that is designed to achieve the cumulative persisting annual savings goals specified in paragraphs (9) through (12) (13) of subsection (b-5) of this Section or in paragraphs (9) through (12) (13) of subsection (b-15) of this Section, as applicable, through implementation of energy efficiency measures; however, the goals may be reduced if either (1) clear and convincing evidence demonstrates, through independent analysis, that the expenditure limits in subsection (m) of this Section preclude full achievement of the goals or (2) the utility's expenditures are limited pursuant to subsection (m) of this Section or, each of the following conditions are met: (A) the plan's analysis and forecasts of the utility's ability to acquire energy savings demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence and through independent analysis that achievement of such goals is not cost effective; and (B) the amount of energy savings achieved by the utility as determined by the independent evaluator for the most recent year for which savings have been evaluated preceding the plan filing was less than the average annual amount of savings required to achieve the goals for the applicable 4-year 5-year plan period. If there is not clear and convincing evidence that achieving the savings goals specified in paragraphs (b-5) or (b-15) of this Section is possible both cost-effectively and within the expenditure limits in subsection (m), such savings goals shall not be reduced. Except as provided in subsection (m) of this Section, annual increases in cumulative persisting annual savings goals during the applicable 4-year 5-year plan period shall not be reduced to amounts that are less than the maximum amount of cumulative persisting annual savings that is forecast to be cost-effectively achievable during the 4-year 5-year plan period. The Commission shall review any proposed goal reduction as part of its review and approval of the utility's proposed plan.  

(4) No later than March 1, 2029, and every 4 years thereafter, each electric utility shall file a 4-year energy efficiency plan commencing on January 1, 2030, and every 4 years thereafter, respectively, that is designed to achieve the cumulative persisting annual savings goals established by the Illinois Commerce Commission pursuant to direction of subsections (b-5) and (b-15) of this Section, as applicable, through implementation of energy efficiency measures; however, the goals may be reduced if either (1) clear and convincing evidence and independent analysis demonstrates that the expenditure limits in subsection (m) of this Section preclude full achievement of the goals or (2) each of the following conditions are met: (A) the plan's analysis and forecasts of the utility's ability to acquire energy savings demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence and through independent analysis that achievement of such goals is not cost-effective; and (B) the amount of energy savings achieved by the utility as determined by the independent evaluator for the most recent year for which savings have been evaluated preceding the plan filing was less than the average annual amount of savings required to achieve the goals for the applicable 4-year plan period. If there is not clear and convincing evidence that achieving the savings goals specified in paragraphs (b-5) or (b-15) of this Section is possible both cost-effectively and within the expenditure limits in subsection (m), such savings goals shall not be reduced. Except as provided in subsection (m) of this Section, annual increases in cumulative persisting annual savings goals during the applicable 4-year plan period shall not be reduced to amounts that are less than the maximum amount of cumulative persisting annual savings that is forecast to be cost-effectively achievable during the 4-year plan period. The Commission shall review any proposed goal reduction as part of its review and approval of the utility's proposed plan.  

Each utility's plan shall set forth the utility's proposals to meet the energy efficiency standards identified in subsection (b-5) or (b-15), as applicable and as such standards may have been modified under this subsection (f), taking into account the unique circumstances of the utility's service territory. For those plans commencing on January 1, 2018, the Commission shall seek public comment on the utility's plan and shall issue an order approving or disapproving each plan no later than 105 days after June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906). For those plans commencing after December 31, 2021, the Commission shall seek public comment on the utility's plan and shall issue an order approving or disapproving each plan within 6 months after its submission. If the Commission disapproves a plan, the Commission shall, within 30 days, describe in detail the reasons for the disapproval and describe a path by which the utility may file a revised draft of the plan to address the Commission's concerns satisfactorily. If the utility does not refile with the Commission within 60 days, the utility shall be subject to penalties at a rate of $\$100$ ,000 per day until the plan is filed. This process shall continue, and penalties shall accrue, until the utility has successfully filed a portfolio of energy efficiency and demand-response measures. Penalties shall be deposited into the Energy Efficiency Trust Fund.  

(g) In submitting proposed plans and funding levels under subsection (f) of this Section to meet the savings goals identified in subsection (b-5) or (b-15) of this Section, as applicable, the utility shall:  

(1) Demonstrate that its proposed energy efficiency measures will achieve the applicable requirements that are identified in subsection (b-5) or (b-15) of this Section, as modified by subsection (f) of this Section.  

(2) (Blank). Present specific proposals to implement new building and appliance standards that have been placed into effect.  

(2.5) Demonstrate consideration of program options for (A) advancing new building codes, appliance standards, and municipal regulations governing existing and new building efficiency improvements and (B) supporting efforts to improve compliance with new building codes, appliance standards and municipal regulations, as potentially cost-effective means of acquiring energy savings to count toward savings goals.  

(3) Demonstrate that its overall portfolio of measures, not including low-income programs described in subsection (c) of this Section, is cost-effective using the total resource cost test or complies with paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (f) of this Section and represents a diverse cross-section of opportunities for customers of all rate classes, other than those customers described in subsection (l) of this Section, to participate in the programs. Individual measures need not be cost effective.  

(3.5) Demonstrate that the utility's plan integrates the delivery of energy efficiency programs with natural gas efficiency programs, programs promoting distributed solar, programs promoting demand response and other efforts to address bill payment issues, including, but not limited to, LIHEAP and the Percentage of Income Payment Plan, to the extent such integration is practical and has the potential to enhance customer engagement, minimize market confusion, or reduce administrative costs.  

(4) Present a third-party energy efficiency implementation program subject to the following requirements:  

(A) beginning with the year commencing January 1, 2019, electric utilities that serve more than 3,000,000 retail customers in the State shall fund third-party energy efficiency programs in an amount that is no less than \$25,000,000 per year, and electric utilities that serve less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State shall fund third-party energy efficiency programs in an amount that is no less than \$8,350,000 per year;  

(B) during 2018, the utility shall conduct a solicitation process for purposes of requesting proposals from third-party vendors for those third-party energy efficiency programs to be offered during one or more of the years commencing January 1, 2019, January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021; for those multi-year plans commencing on January 1, 2022 and  

January 1, 2026, the utility shall conduct a solicitation process during 2021 and 2025, respectively, for purposes of requesting proposals from third-party vendors for those third-party energy efficiency programs to be offered during one or more years of the respective multi-year plan period; for each solicitation process, the utility shall identify the sector, technology, or geographical area for which it is seeking requests for proposals; the solicitation process must be either for programs that fill gaps in the utility's program portfolio and for programs that target low-income customers, business sectors, building types, geographies, or other specific parts of its customer base with initiatives that would be more effective at reaching these customer segments than the utilities' programs filed in its energy efficiency plans;  

(C) the utility shall propose the bidder qualifications, performance measurement process, and contract structure, which must include a performance payment mechanism and general terms and conditions; the proposed qualifications, process, and structure shall be subject to Commission approval; and  

(D) the utility shall retain an independent third party to score the proposals received through the solicitation process described in this paragraph (4), rank them according to their cost per lifetime kilowatt-hours saved, and assemble the portfolio of third-party programs.  

The electric utility shall recover all costs associated with Commission-approved, third-party administered programs regardless of the success of those programs.  

(4.5) Implement cost-effective demand-response measures to reduce peak demand by 0.1% over the prior year for eligible retail customers, as defined in Section 16-111.5 of this Act, and for customers that elect hourly service from the utility pursuant to Section 16-107 of this Act, provided those customers have not been declared competitive. This requirement continues until December 31, 2026.  

(5) Include a proposed or revised cost-recovery tariff mechanism, as provided for under subsection (d) of this Section, to fund the proposed energy efficiency and demand-response measures and to ensure the recovery of the prudently and reasonably incurred costs of Commission-approved programs.  

(6) Provide for an annual independent evaluation of the performance of the cost-effectiveness of the utility's portfolio of measures, as well as a full review of the multi-year plan results of the broader net program impacts and, to the extent practical, for adjustment of the measures on a going-forward basis as a result of the evaluations. The resources dedicated to evaluation shall not exceed 3% of portfolio resources in any given year.  

(7) For electric utilities that serve more than 3,000,000 retail customers in the State:  

(A) Through December 31, 2025, provide for an adjustment to the return on equity component of the utility's weighted average cost of capital calculated under subsection (d) of this Section:  

(i) If the independent evaluator determines that the utility achieved a cumulative persisting annual savings that is less than the applicable annual incremental goal, then the return on equity component shall be reduced by a maximum of 200 basis points in the event that the utility achieved no more than $75\%$ of such goal. If the utility achieved more than $75\%$ of the applicable annual incremental goal but less than $100\%$ of such goal, then the return on equity component shall be reduced by 8 basis points for each percent by which the utility failed to achieve the goal.  

(ii) If the independent evaluator determines that the utility achieved a cumulative persisting annual savings that is more than the applicable annual incremental goal, then the return on equity component shall be increased by a maximum of 200 basis points in the event that the utility achieved at least $125\%$ of such goal. If the utility achieved more than $100\%$ of the applicable annual incremental goal but less than $125\%$ of such goal, then the return on equity component shall be increased by 8 basis points for each percent by which the utility achieved above the goal. If the applicable annual incremental goal was reduced under paragraphs (1) or (2) of subsection (f) of this Section, then the following adjustments shall be made to the calculations described in this item  

# (ii):  

(aa) the calculation for determining achievement that is at least $125\%$ of the applicable annual incremental goal shall use the unreduced applicable annual incremental goal to set the value; and  

(bb) the calculation for determining achievement that is less than $125\%$ but more than $100\%$ of the applicable annual incremental goal shall use the reduced applicable annual incremental goal to set the value for $100\%$ achievement of the goal and shall use the unreduced goal to set the value for $125\%$ achievement. The 8 basis point value shall also be modified, as necessary, so that the  

200 basis points are evenly apportioned among each percentage point value between $100\%$ and $125\%$ achievement.  

(B) For the period January 1, 2026 through December 31, 2029 and in all subsequent 4-year periods 2030, provide for an adjustment to the return on equity component of the utility's weighted average cost of capital calculated under subsection (d) of this Section:  

(i) If the independent evaluator determines that the utility achieved a cumulative persisting annual savings that is less than the applicable annual incremental goal, then the return on equity component shall be reduced by a maximum of 200 basis points in the event that the utility achieved no more than $66\%$ of such goal. If the utility achieved more than $66\%$ of the applicable annual incremental goal but less than $100\%$ of such goal, then the return on equity component shall be reduced by 6 basis points for each percent by which the utility failed to achieve the goal.  

(ii) If the independent evaluator determines that the utility achieved a cumulative persisting annual savings that is more than the applicable annual incremental goal, then the return on equity component shall be increased by a maximum of 200 basis points in the event that the utility achieved at least $134\%$ of such goal. If the utility achieved more than $100\%$ of the applicable annual incremental goal but less than $134\%$ of such goal, then the return on equity component shall be increased by 6 basis points for each percent by which the utility achieved above the goal. If the applicable annual incremental goal was reduced under paragraph (3) of subsection (f) of this Section, then the following adjustments shall be made to the calculations described in this item  

# (ii):  

(aa) the calculation for determining achievement that is at least $134\%$ of the applicable annual incremental goal shall use the unreduced applicable annual incremental goal to set the value; and  

(bb) the calculation for determining achievement that is less than $134\%$ but more than $100\%$ of the applicable annual incremental goal shall use the reduced applicable annual incremental goal to set the value for $100\%$ achievement of the goal and shall use the unreduced goal to set the value for $134\%$ achievement. The 6 basis point value shall also be modified, as necessary, so that the  

200 basis points are evenly apportioned among each percentage point value between $100\%$ and $134\%$ achievement.  

(C) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph (7), if the applicable annual incremental goal for an electric utility is ever less than 0.6% of deemed average weather normalized sales of electric power and energy during calendar years 2014, 2015, and 2016, an adjustment to the return on equity component of the utility's weighted average cost of capital calculated under subsection (d) of this Section shall be made as  

# follows:  

(i) If the independent evaluator determines that the utility achieved a cumulative persisting annual savings that is less than would have been achieved had the applicable annual incremental goal been achieved, then the return on equity component shall be reduced by a maximum of 200 basis points if the utility achieved no more than 75% of its applicable annual total savings requirement as defined in paragraph (7.5) of this subsection. If the utility achieved more than 75% of the applicable annual total savings requirement but less than 100% of such goal, then the return on equity component shall be reduced by 8 basis points for each percent by which the utility failed to achieve the goal.  

(ii) If the independent evaluator determines that the utility achieved a cumulative persisting annual savings that is more than would have been achieved had the applicable annual incremental goal been achieved, then the return on equity component shall be increased by a maximum of 200 basis points if the utility achieved at least 125% of its applicable annual total savings requirement. If the utility achieved more than 100% of the applicable annual total savings requirement but less than 125% of such goal, then the return on equity component shall be increased by 8 basis points for each percent by which the utility achieved above the applicable annual total savings requirement. If the applicable annual incremental goal was reduced under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (f) of this Section, then the following adjustments shall be made to the calculations described in this item (ii):   
the calculation  

(aa) for determining achievement that is at least 125% of the applicable annual total savings requirement shall use the unreduced applicable annual incremental goal to set the value; and  

(bb) the calculation for determining achievement that is less than 125% but more than 100% of the applicable annual total savings requirement shall use the reduced applicable annual incremental goal to set the value for 100% achievement of the goal and shall use the unreduced goal to set the value for 125% achievement. The 8 basis point value shall also be modified, as necessary, so that the 200 basis points are evenly apportioned among each percentage point value between 100% and 125% achievement.  

(7.5) For purposes of this Section, the term "applicable annual incremental goal" means the difference between the cumulative persisting annual savings goal for the calendar year that is the subject of the independent evaluator's determination and the cumulative persisting annual savings goal for the immediately preceding calendar year, as such goals are defined in subsections (b-5) and (b-15) of this Section and as these goals may have been modified as provided for under subsection (b-20) and paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (f) of this Section. Under subsections (b), (b-5), (b-10), and (b-15) of this Section, a utility must first replace energy savings from measures that have expired reached the end of their measure lives and would otherwise have to be replaced to meet the applicable savings goals identified in subsection (b-5) or (b-15) of this Section before any progress towards achievement of its applicable annual incremental goal may be counted. Savings may expire because measures installed in previous years have reached the end of their lives, because measures installed in previous years are producing lower savings in the current year than in the previous year, or for other reasons identified by independent evaluators. Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Section, the difference between the actual annual incremental savings achieved in any given year, including the replacement of energy savings from measures that have expired, and the applicable annual incremental goal shall not affect adjustments to the return on equity for subsequent calendar years under this subsection (g).  

In this Section, "applicable annual total savings requirement" means the total amount of new annual savings that the utility must achieve in any given year to achieve the applicable annual incremental goal. This is equal to the applicable annual incremental goal plus the total new annual savings that are required to replace savings that expired in or at the end of the previous year.  

(8) For electric utilities that serve less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State:  

(A) Through December 31, 2025, the applicable annual incremental goal shall be compared to the annual incremental savings as determined by the independent evaluator.  

(i) The return on equity component shall be reduced by 8 basis points for each percent by which the utility did not achieve 84.4% of the applicable annual incremental goal.  

(ii) The return on equity component shall be increased by 8 basis points for each percent by which the utility exceeded $100\%$ of the applicable annual incremental goal.  

(iii) The return on equity component shall not be increased or decreased if the annual incremental savings as determined by the independent evaluator is greater than 84.4% of the applicable annual incremental goal and less than $100\%$ of the applicable annual incremental goal.  

(iv) The return on equity component shall not be increased or decreased by an amount greater than 200 basis points pursuant to this subparagraph (A).  

(B) For the period of January 1, 2026 through December 31, 2029 and in all subsequent 4-year periods 2030, the applicable annual incremental goal shall be compared to the annual incremental savings as determined by the independent evaluator.  

(i) The return on equity component shall be reduced by 6 basis points for each percent by which the utility did not achieve $100\%$ of the applicable annual incremental goal.  

(ii) The return on equity component shall be increased by 6 basis points for each percent by which the utility exceeded $100\%$ of the applicable annual incremental goal.  

(iii) The return on equity component shall not be increased or decreased by an amount greater than 200 basis points pursuant to this subparagraph (B).  

(C) Notwithstanding provisions in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (7) of this subsection, if the applicable annual incremental goal for an electric utility is ever less than 0.6% of deemed average weather normalized sales of electric power and energy during calendar years 2014, 2015 and 2016, an adjustment to the return on equity component of the utility's weighted average cost of capital calculated under subsection (d) of this Section shall be made as follows:  

(i) The return on equity component shall be reduced by 8 basis points for each percent by which the utility did not achieve 100% of the applicable annual total savings requirement.  

(ii) The return on equity component shall be increased by 8 basis points for each percent by which the utility exceeded 100% of the applicable annual total savings requirement.  

(iii) The return on equity component shall not be increased or decreased by an amount greater than 200 basis points pursuant to this subparagraph (C).  

(D) (C) If the applicable annual incremental goal was reduced under paragraph paragraphs (1), (2), or (3), or (4) of subsection (f) of this Section, then the following adjustments shall be made to the calculations described in subparagraphs (A), and $(\mathtt{B})\lrcorner$ and (C) of this paragraph (8):  

(i) The calculation for determining achievement that is at least $125\%$ or $134\%$ , as applicable, of the applicable annual incremental goal or the applicable annual total savings requirement, as applicable, shall use the unreduced applicable annual incremental goal to set the value.  

(ii) For the period through December 31, 2025, the calculation for determining achievement that is less than $125\%$ but more than $100\%$ of the applicable annual incremental goal or the applicable annual total savings requirement, as applicable, shall use the reduced applicable annual incremental goal to set the value for $100\%$ achievement of the goal and shall use the unreduced goal to set the value for $125\%$ achievement. The 8 basis point value shall also be modified, as necessary, so that the 200 basis points are evenly apportioned among each percentage point value between $100\%$ and $125\%$ achievement.  

(iii) For the period of January 1, 2026 through December 31, 2029 and all subsequent 4-year periods, the calculation for determining achievement that is less than 125% or 134%, as applicable, but more than 100% of the applicable annual incremental goal or the applicable annual total savings requirement, as applicable, shall use the reduced applicable annual incremental goal to set the value for $100\%$ achievement of the goal and shall use the unreduced goal to set the value for 125% achievement. The 6 basis-point value or 8 basis-point value, as applicable, shall also be modified, as necessary, so that the 200 basis points are evenly apportioned among each percentage point value between 100% and 125% or between 100% and 134% achievement, as applicable  

2030, the calculation for determining achievement that is less than 134% but more than 100% of the applicable annual incremental goal shall use the reduced applicable annual incremental goal to set the value for 100% achievement of the goal and shall use the unreduced goal to set the value for 125% achievement. The 6 basis point value shall also be modified, as necessary, so that the 200 basis points are evenly apportioned among each percentage point value between 100% and 134% achievement.  

(9) The utility shall submit the energy savings data to the independent evaluator no later than 30 days after the close of the plan year. The independent evaluator shall determine the cumulative persisting annual savings for a given plan year, as well as an estimate of job impacts and other macroeconomic impacts of the efficiency programs for that year, no later than 120 days after the close of the plan year. The utility shall submit an informational filing to the Commission no later than 160 days after the close of the plan year that attaches the independent evaluator's final report identifying the cumulative persisting annual savings for the year and calculates, under paragraph (7) or (8) of this subsection (g), as applicable, any resulting change to the utility's return on equity component of the weighted average cost of capital applicable to the next plan year beginning with the January monthly billing period and extending through the December monthly billing period. However, if the utility recovers the costs incurred under this Section under paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (d) of this Section, then the utility shall not be required to submit such informational filing, and shall instead submit the information that would otherwise be included in the informational filing as part of its filing under paragraph (3) of such subsection (d) that is due on or before June 1 of each year.  

For those utilities that must submit the informational filing, the Commission may, on its own motion or by petition, initiate an investigation of such filing, provided, however, that the utility's proposed return on equity calculation shall be deemed the final, approved calculation on December 15 of the year in which it is filed unless the Commission enters an order on or before December 15, after notice and hearing, that modifies such calculation consistent with this Section.  

The adjustments to the return on equity component described in paragraphs (7) and (8) of this subsection (g) shall be applied as described in such paragraphs through a separate tariff mechanism, which shall be filed by the utility under subsections (f) and (g) of this Section.  

(9.5) The utility must demonstrate how it will ensure that program implementation contractors and energy efficiency installation vendors will promote workforce equity and quality jobs.  

(9.6) Utilities shall collect data necessary to ensure compliance with paragraph (9.5) no less than quarterly and shall communicate progress toward compliance with paragraph (9.5) to program implementation contractors and energy efficiency installation vendors no less than quarterly. Utilities shall work with relevant vendors, providing education, training, and other resources needed to ensure compliance and, where necessary, adjusting or terminating work with vendors that cannot assist with compliance.  

(10) Utilities required to implement efficiency programs under subsections (b-5) and (b-10) shall report annually to the Illinois Commerce Commission and the General Assembly on how hiring, contracting, job training, and other practices related to its energy efficiency programs enhance the diversity of vendors working on such programs. These reports must include data on vendor and employee diversity, including data on the implementation of paragraphs (9.5) and (9.6). If the utility is not meeting the requirements of paragraphs (9.5) and (9.6), the utility shall submit a plan to adjust their activities so that they meet the requirements of paragraphs (9.5) and (9.6) within the following year.  

(h) No more than 4% 6% of energy efficiency and demand-response program revenue may be allocated for research, development, or pilot deployment of new equipment or measures. Electric utilities shall work with interested stakeholders to formulate a plan for how these funds should be spent, incorporate statewide approaches for these allocations, and file a 4-year plan that demonstrates that collaboration. If a utility files a request for modified annual energy savings goals with the Commission, then a utility shall forgo spending portfolio dollars on research and development proposals.  

(i) When practicable, electric utilities shall incorporate advanced metering infrastructure data into the planning, implementation, and evaluation of energy efficiency measures and programs, subject to the data privacy and confidentiality protections of applicable law.  

(j) The independent evaluator shall follow the guidelines and use the savings set forth in Commission-approved energy efficiency policy manuals and technical reference manuals, as each may be updated from time to time. Until such time as measure life values for energy efficiency measures implemented for low-income households under subsection (c) of this Section are incorporated into such Commission-approved manuals, the low-income measures shall have the same measure life values that are established for same measures implemented in households that are not low-income households.  

(k) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, an electric utility subject to the requirements of this Section may file a tariff cancelling an automatic adjustment clause tariff in effect under this Section or Section 8-103, which shall take effect no later than one business day after the date such tariff is filed. Thereafter, the utility shall be authorized to defer and recover its expenditures incurred under this Section through a new tariff authorized under subsection (d) of this Section or in the utility's next rate case under Article IX or Section 16-108.5 of this Act, with interest at an annual rate equal to the utility's weighted average cost of capital as approved by the Commission in such case. If the utility elects to file a new tariff under subsection (d) of this Section, the utility may file the tariff within 10 days after June 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906), and the cost inputs to such tariff shall be based on the projected costs to be incurred by the utility during the calendar year in which the new tariff is filed and that were not recovered under the tariff that was cancelled as provided for in this subsection. Such costs shall include those incurred or to be incurred by the utility under its multi-year plan approved under subsections (f) and (g) of this Section, including, but not limited to, projected capital investment costs and projected regulatory asset balances with correspondingly updated depreciation and amortization reserves and expense. The Commission shall, after notice and hearing, approve, or approve with modification, such tariff and cost inputs no later than 75 days after the utility filed the tariff, provided that such approval, or approval with modification, shall be consistent with the provisions of this Section to the extent they do not conflict with this subsection (k). The tariff approved by the Commission shall take effect no later than 5 days after the Commission enters its order approving the tariff.  

No later than 60 days after the effective date of the tariff cancelling the utility's automatic adjustment clause tariff, the utility shall file a reconciliation that reconciles the moneys collected under its automatic adjustment clause tariff with the costs incurred during the period beginning June 1, 2016 and ending on the date that the electric utility's automatic adjustment clause tariff was cancelled. In the event the reconciliation reflects an under-collection, the utility shall recover the costs as specified in this subsection (k). If the reconciliation reflects an over-collection, the utility shall apply the amount of such over-collection as a one-time credit to retail customers' bills.  

(l) For the calendar years covered by a multi-year plan commencing after December 31, 2017, subsections (a) through (j) of this Section do not apply to eligible large private energy customers that have chosen to opt out of multi-year plans consistent with this subsection (1).  

(1) For purposes of this subsection (l), "eligible large private energy customer" means any retail customers, except for federal, State, municipal, and other public customers, of an electric utility that serves more than 3,000,000 retail customers, except for federal, State, municipal and other public customers, in the State and whose total highest 30 minute demand was more than 10,000 kilowatts, or any retail customers of an electric utility that serves less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State and whose total highest 15 minute demand was more than 10,000 kilowatts. For purposes of this subsection (l), "retail customer" has the meaning set forth in Section 16-102 of this Act. However, for a business entity with multiple sites located in the State, where at least one of those sites qualifies as an eligible large private energy customer, then any of that business entity's sites, properly identified on a form for notice, shall be considered eligible large private energy customers for the purposes of this subsection (l). A determination of whether this subsection is applicable to a customer shall be made for each multi-year plan beginning after December 31, 2017. The criteria for determining whether this subsection (l) is applicable to a retail customer shall be based on the 12 consecutive billing periods prior to the start of the first year of each such multi-year plan. (2) Within 45 days after the effective date of this  

endatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, the mmission shall prescribe the form for notice required r opting out of energy efficiency programs. The notice st be submitted to the retail electric utility 12 months   
before the next energy efficiency planning cycle. However, thin 120 days after the Commission's initial issuance of   
th e for m for notice, eligible large private energy stomers may submit a form for notice to an electric ility. The form for notice for opting out of energy ficiency programs shall include all of the following: (A) a statement indicating that the customer has elected to opt out; (B) the account numbers for the customer accounts to which the opt out shall apply; (C) the mailing address associated with the customer accounts identified under subparagraph (B); (D) an American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) level 2 or higher audit report conducted by an independent third-party expert identifying cost-effective energy efficiency project opportunities that could be invested in over the next 10 years. A retail customer with specialized processes may utilize a self-audit process in lieu of the ASHRAE audit; (E) a description of the customer's plans to reallocate the funds toward internal energy efficiency  

efforts identified in the subparagraph (D) report, including, but not limited to: (i) strategic energy management or other programs, including descriptions of targeted buildings, equipment and operations; (ii) eligible energy efficiency measures; and (iii) expected energy savings, itemized by technology. If the subparagraph (D) audit report identifies that the customer currently utilizes the best available energy efficient technology, equipment, programs, and operations, the customer may provide a statement that more efficient technology, equipment, programs, and operations are not reasonably available as a means of satisfying this subparagraph (E); and  

(F) the effective date of the opt out, which will be the next January 1 following notice of the opt out.  

(3) Upon receipt of a properly and timely noticed request for opt out submitted by an eligible large private energy customer, the retail electric utility shall grant the request, file the request with the Commission and, beginning January 1 of the following year, the opted out customer shall no longer be assessed the costs of the plan and shall be prohibited from participating in that 4-year plan cycle to give the retail utility the certainty to design program plan proposals.  

(4) Upon a customer's election to opt out under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection (l) and commencing on the effective date of said opt out, the account properly identified in the customer's notice under paragraph (2) shall not be subject to any cost recovery and shall not be eligible to participate in, or directly benefit from, compliance with energy efficiency cumulative persisting savings requirements under subsections (a) through (j).  

(5) A utility's cumulative persisting annual savings targets will exclude any opted out load.  

(6) The request to opt out is only valid for the requested plan cycle. An eligible large private energy customer must also request to opt out for future energy plan cycles, otherwise the customer will be included in the future energy plan cycle. For the calendar years covered by a multi-year plan commencing after December 31, 2017, subsections (a) through (j) of this Section do not apply to any retail customers of an electric utility that serves more than 3,000,000 retail customers in the State and whose total highest 30 minute demand was more than 10,000 kilowatts, or any retail customers of an electric utility that serves less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State and whose total highest 15 minute demand was more than 10,000 kilowatts. For purposes of this subsection (l), "retail customer" has the meaning set forth in Section 16-102 of this Act. A determination of whether this subsection is applicable to a customer shall be made for each multi-year plan beginning after December 31, 2017. The criteria for determining whether this subsection (l) is applicable to a retail customer shall be based on the 12 consecutive billing periods prior to the start of the first year of each such multi-year plan.  

(m) Notwithstanding the requirements of this Section, as part of a proceeding to approve a multi-year plan under subsections (f) and (g) of this Section if the multi-year plan has been designed to maximize savings, but does not meet the cost cap limitations of this Section, the Commission shall reduce the amount of energy efficiency measures implemented for any single year, and whose costs are recovered under subsection (d) of this Section, by an amount necessary to limit the estimated average net increase due to the cost of the measures to no more than  

(1) 3.5% for each of the 4 years beginning January 1, 2018,  

(2) (blank), 3.75% for each of the 4 years beginning   
January 1, 2022, and (3) 4% for each of the 4 5 years beginning January 1,   
2022 2026, (4) 4.25% for the 4 years beginning January 1, 2026,   
and (5) 4.25% plus an increase sufficient to account for   
the rate of inflation between January 1, 2026 and January  

1 of the first year of each subsequent 4-year plan cycle, of the average amount paid per kilowatthour by residential eligible retail customers during calendar year 2015. An electric utility may plan to spend up to 10% more in any year during an applicable multi-year plan period to cost-effectively achieve additional savings so long as the average over the applicable multi-year plan period does not exceed the percentages defined in items (1) through (5). To determine the total amount that may be spent by an electric utility in any single year, the applicable percentage of the average amount paid per kilowatthour shall be multiplied by the total amount of energy delivered by such electric utility in the calendar year 2015, adjusted to reflect the proportion of the utility's load attributable to customers that have opted out of who are exempt from subsections (a) through (j) of this Section under subsection (l) of this Section. For purposes of this subsection (m), the amount paid per kilowatthour includes, without limitation, estimated amounts paid for supply, transmission, distribution, surcharges, and add-on taxes. For purposes of this Section, "eligible retail customers" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 16-111.5 of this Act. Once the Commission has approved a plan under subsections (f) and (g) of this Section, no subsequent rate impact determinations shall be made.  

(n) A utility shall take advantage of the efficiencies available through existing Illinois Home Weatherization  

Assistance Program infrastructure and services, such as enrollment, marketing, quality assurance and implementation, which can reduce the need for similar services at a lower cost than utility-only programs, subject to capacity constraints at community action agencies, for both single-family and multifamily weatherization services, to the extent Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program community action agencies provide multifamily services. A utility's plan shall demonstrate that in formulating annual weatherization budgets, it has sought input and coordination with community action agencies regarding agencies' capacity to expand and maximize Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program delivery using the ratepayer dollars collected under this Section.

(220 ILCS 5/8-512 new)  

Sec. 8-512. Renewable energy access plan.  

(a) It is the policy of this State to promote cost-effective transmission system development that ensures reliability of the electric transmission system, lowers carbon emissions, minimizes long-term costs for consumers, and supports the electric policy goals of this State. The General Assembly finds that:  

(1) Transmission planning, primarily for reliability purposes, but also for economic and public policy reasons is conducted by regional transmission organizations in which transmission-owning Illinois utilities and other stakeholders are members.  

(2) Order No. 1000 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission requires regional transmission organizations to plan for transmission system needs in light of State public policies and to accept input from states during the transmission system planning processes.  

(3) The State of Illinois does not currently have a comprehensive power and environmental policy planning process to identify transmission infrastructure needs that can serve as a vital input into the regional and interregional transmission organization planning processes conducted under Order No. 1000 and other laws and regulations.  

(4) This State is an electricity generation and power transmission hub, and can leverage that position to invest in infrastructure that enables new and existing Illinois generators to meet the public policy goals of the State of Illinois and of interconnected states while cost-effectively supporting tens of thousands of jobs in the renewable energy sector in this State.  

(5) The nation has a need to readily access this State's low-cost, clean electric power, and this State also desires access to clean energy resources in other states to develop and support its low-carbon economy and keep electricity prices low in Illinois and interconnected States.  

(6) Existing transmission infrastructure may constrain the State's achievement of 100% renewable energy by 2050, the accelerated adoption of electric vehicles in a just and equitable way, and electrification of additional sectors of the Illinois economy.  

(7) Transmission system congestion within this State and the regional transmission organizations serving this State limits the ability of this State's existing and new electric generation facilities that do not emit carbon dioxide, including renewable energy resources and zero emission facilities, to serve the public policy goals of this State and other states, which constrains investment in this State.  

(8) Investment in infrastructure to support existing and new electric generation facilities that do not emit carbon dioxide, including renewable energy resources and zero emission facilities, stimulates significant economic development and job growth in this State, as well as creates environmental and public health benefits in this State.  

(9) Creating a forward-looking plan for this State's electric transmission infrastructure, as opposed to relying on case-by-case development and repeated marginal upgrades, will achieve a lower-cost system for Illinois' electricity customers. A forward-looking plan can also help integrate and achieve a comprehensive set of objectives and multiple state, regional, and national policy goals.  

(10) Alternatives to overhead electric transmission lines can achieve cost-effective resolution of system impacts and warrant investigation of the circumstances under which those alternatives should be considered and approved. The alternatives are likely to be beneficial as investment in electric transmission infrastructure moves forward.  

(11) Because transmission planning is conducted primarily by the regional transmission organizations, the Commission should be advocating for the State's interests at the regional transmission organizations to ensure that such planning facilitates the State's policies and goals, including overall consumer savings, power system reliability, economic development, environmental improvement, and carbon reduction.  

(b) Consistent with the findings identified in subsection (a), the Commission shall open an investigation to develop and adopt a renewable energy access plan no later than December 31, 2022. To assist and support the Commission in the development of the plan, the Commission shall retain the services of technical and policy experts with relevant fields of expertise, solicit technical and policy analysis from the public, and provide for a 120-day open public comment period after publication of a draft report, which shall be published no later than 90 days after the comment period ends. The plan shall, at a minimum, do the following:  

(1) designate renewable energy access plan zones   
throughout this State in areas in which renewable energy   
resources and suitable land areas are sufficient for   
developing generating capacity from renewable energy   
technologies; (2) develop a plan to achieve transmission capacity   
necessary to deliver the electric output from renewable   
energy technologies in the renewable energy access plan  

zones to customers in Illinois and other states in a manner that is most beneficial and cost-effective to customers;  

(3) use this State's position as an electricity generation and power transmission hub to create new investment in this State's renewable energy resources;  

(4) consider programs, policies, and electric transmission projects that can be adopted within this State that promote the cost-effective delivery of power from renewable energy resources interconnected to the bulk electric system to meet the renewable portfolio standard targets under subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act;  

(5) consider proposals to improve regional transmission organizations regional and interregional system planning processes, especially proposals that reduce costs and emissions, create jobs, and increase State and regional power system reliability to prevent high-cost outages that can endanger lives, and analyze of how those proposals would improve reliability and cost-effective delivery of electricity in Illinois and the region;  

(6) make findings and policy recommendations based on technical and policy analysis regarding locations of renewable energy access plan zones and the transmission system developments needed to cost-effectively achieve the public policy goals identified herein; and  

(7) present the Commission's conclusions and proposed recommendations based on its analysis and use the findings and policy recommendations to determine actions that the Commission should take.  

(c) No later than December 31, 2025, and every other year thereafter, the Commission shall open an investigation to develop and adopt an updated renewable energy access plan that, at a minimum, evaluates the implementation and effectiveness of the renewable energy access plan, recommends improvements to the renewable energy access plan, and provides changes to transmission capacity necessary to deliver electric output from the renewable energy access plan zones.

The Consumer Intervenor Compensation Fund shall be administered by an Administrator that is a person or entity that is independent of the Commission. The administrator will be responsible for the prudent management of the Consumer Intervenor Compensation Fund and for recommendations for the award of consumer intervenor compensation from the Consumer Intervenor Compensation Fund. The Commission shall issue a request for qualifications for a third-party program administrator to administer the Consumer Intervenor Compensation Fund. The third-party administrator shall be chosen through a competitive bid process based on selection criteria and requirements developed by the Commission. The Illinois  

Procurement Code does not apply to the hiring or payment of the Administrator. All Administrator costs may be paid for using monies from the Consumer Intervenor Compensation Fund, but the Program Administrator shall strive to minimize costs in the implementation of the program.  

(B) The computation of compensation awarded from the fund shall take into consideration the market rates paid to persons of comparable training and experience who offer similar services, but may not exceed the comparable market rate for services paid by the public utility as part of its rate case expense.  

(C)(1) Recommendations on the award of compensation by the administrator shall include consideration of whether the Commission adopted a material recommendation related to a significant issue in the docket and whether participation caused a financial hardship to the participant and the payment of compensation is fair, just and reasonable.  

(2) Recommendations on the award of compensation by the administrator shall be submitted to the Commission for approval. Unless the Commission initiates an investigation within 45 days after the notice to the Commission, the award of compensation shall be allowed 45 days after notice to the Commission. Such notice shall be given by filing with the Commission on the Commission's e-docket system, and keeping open for public inspection the award  

for compensation proposed by the Administrator. The Commission shall have power, and it is hereby given authority, either upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, at once, and if it so orders, without answer or other formal pleadings, but upon reasonable notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning the propriety of the award. (c) The Commission may adopt rules to implement this Section.

(220 ILCS 5/9-241) (from Ch. 111 2/3, par. 9-241)  

Sec. 9-241. No public utility shall, as to rates or other charges, services, facilities or in other respect, make or grant any preference or advantage to any corporation or person or subject any corporation or person to any prejudice or disadvantage. No public utility shall establish or maintain any unreasonable difference as to rates or other charges, services, facilities, or in any other respect, either as between localities or as between classes of service.  

However, nothing in this Section shall be construed as limiting the authority of the Commission to permit the establishment of economic development rates as incentives to economic development either in enterprise zones as designated by the State of Illinois or in other areas of a utility's service area. Such rates should be available to existing businesses which demonstrate an increase to existing load as well as new businesses which create new load for a utility so as to create a more balanced utilization of generating capacity. The Commission shall ensure that such rates are established at a level which provides a net benefit to customers within a public utility's service area.  

On or before January 1, 2023, the Commission shall conduct   
a comprehensive study to assess whether low-income discount   
rates for electric and natural gas residential customers are   
appropriate and the potential design and implementation of any   
such rates. The Commission shall include its findings,   
together with the appropriate recommendations, in a report to provided to the General Assembly. Upon completion of the   
study, the Commission shall have the authority to permit or   
require electric and natural gas utilities to file a tariff   
establishing low-income discount rates. Such study shall assess, at a minimum, the following: (1) customer eligibility requirements, including income-based eligibility and eligibility based on participation in or eligibility for certain public assistance programs; (2) appropriate rate structures, including consideration of tiered discounts for different income levels; (3) appropriate recovery mechanisms, including the consideration of volumetric charges and customer charges;  

(4) appropriate verification mechanisms; (5) measures to ensure customer confidentiality and data safeguards; (6) outreach and consumer education procedures; and (7) the impact that a low-income discount rate would have on the affordability of delivery service to low-income customers and customers overall. The Commission shall adopt rules requiring utility companies to produce information, in the form of a mailing, and other approved methods of distribution, to its consumers, to inform the consumers of available rebates, discounts, credits, and other cost-saving mechanisms that can help them lower their monthly utility bills, and send out such information semi-annually, unless otherwise provided by this Article.  

Prior to October 1, 1989, no public utility providing electrical or gas service shall consider the use of solar or other nonconventional renewable sources of energy by a customer as a basis for establishing higher rates or charges for any service or commodity sold to such customer; nor shall a public utility subject any customer utilizing such energy source or sources to any other prejudice or disadvantage on account of such use. No public utility shall without the consent of the Commission, charge or receive any greater compensation in the aggregate for a lesser commodity, product, or service than for a greater commodity, product or service of  

like character.  

The Commission, in order to expedite the determination of rate questions, or to avoid unnecessary and unreasonable expense, or to avoid unjust or unreasonable discrimination between classes of customers, or, whenever in the judgment of the Commission public interest so requires, may, for rate making and accounting purposes, or either of them, consider one or more municipalities either with or without the adjacent or intervening rural territory as a regional unit where the same public utility serves such region under substantially similar conditions, and may within such region prescribe uniform rates for consumers or patrons of the same class.  

Any public utility, with the consent and approval of the Commission, may as a basis for the determination of the charges made by it classify its service according to the amount used, the time when used, the purpose for which used, and other relevant factors.

Sec. 16-105.5. Rate case filing and revenue-neutral rate   
design. (a) An electric utility that files a general rate case   
pursuant to Section 9-201 of this Act or a Multi-Year Rate Plan   
pursuant to Section 16-108.18 of this Act may omit the rate   
design component of such filing and subsequently separately  

file this component with the Commission, subject to the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this Section.  

(b) If the electric utility makes the election described in this Section, then the filing shall be consistent with the rate design and cost allocation across customer classes approved in the Commission's most recent order regarding the electric utility's request for a general adjustment to its rates entered under Section 9-201, subsection (e) of Section 16-108.5, or Section 16-108.18 of this Act, as applicable.  

(c) If the electric utility makes the election described in this Section, then the following provisions apply to the separate filing of the revenue-neutral rate design component:  

(1) No later than one year after the tariffs implementing the general rate case filing or Multi-year Rate Plan filing, as described in subsection (b) of this Section, are placed into effect, the electric utility shall make a filing with the Commission that proposes changes to the tariffs to incorporate the findings of any final rate design orders of the Commission applicable to the electric utility and entered subsequent to the Commission's approval of the tariffs. If no such orders have been entered, then the electric utility must submit its separate revenue-neutral rate design filing no later than 3 years after the date on which the Commission's most recent final rate design order was entered for the electric utility. The electric utility's separate revenue-neutral rate design filing may either propose revenue-neutral tariff changes or refile the existing tariffs without change, which shall present the Commission with an opportunity to suspend the tariffs and consider revenue-neutral tariff changes related to rate design. The Commission shall, after notice and hearing, enter its order approving, or approving with modification, the proposed changes to the tariffs within 240 days after the electric utility's filing. Any changes ordered by the Commission shall become effective at the commencement of the first January monthly billing period that begins no earlier than 30 days after the Commission issues its order adopting such changes.  

(2) Following Commission approval under paragraph (1) of this subsection (c), the electric utility shall make a filing with the Commission during each subsequent 3-year period that either proposes revenue-neutral tariff changes or refiles the existing tariffs without change, which shall present the Commission with an opportunity to suspend the tariffs and consider revenue-neutral tariff changes related to rate design. The requirements of this paragraph (2) shall terminate at the time that the electric utility files a general rate case or Multi-Year Rate Plan that includes the rate design component.  

Sec. 16-105.6. Amortization of charges or credits.  

(a) It is in the public interest to mitigate the customer bill impacts of large expenses incurred by electric utilities by directing that expenses exceeding the applicable threshold specified in this Section be amortized over the prescribed period. Such amortization will levelize customer bill impacts and, in many instances, better align the period of cost recovery with the period over which customers receive the benefit of the expenditure. Accordingly, an electric utility that files a general rate increase under Section 9-201 of this Act or a Multi-Year Rate Plan under Section 16-108.18 of this Act shall amortize, over a 5-year period, each charge or credit that exceeds the applicable amount identified in subsection (b) of this Section and that relates to (1) a workforce reduction program's severance costs; (2) changes in accounting rules; (3) changes in law; (4) compliance with any Commission-initiated audit; and (5) a single storm or weather system, or other similar expense.  

Any unamortized balance shall be reflected in rate base.  

In this Section, "changes in law" includes any enactment, repeal, or amendment in a law, ordinance, rule, regulation, interpretation, permit, license, consent, or order, including those relating to taxes, accounting, or environmental matters, or in the interpretation or application thereof by any governmental authority occurring after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly.  

Nothing in this Section is intended to prohibit the Commission from reviewing the prudence and reasonableness of the costs amortized pursuant to this Section.  

(b) An electric utility that serves more than 3,000,000 customers in the State shall amortize the full amount of each charge or credit described in subsection (a) of this Section that exceeds \$10,000,000 in the applicable calendar year, and an electric utility that serves less than 3,000,000 customers in the State shall amortize the full amount of each such charge or credit that exceeds \$3,700,000 in the applicable calendar year.  

(220 ILCS 5/16-105.7 new)  

Sec. 16-105.7. Revenue balancing adjustments.  

(a) It is in the public interest to decouple electric utility sales and revenues, to mitigate the impact on utilities of energy savings goals, to mitigate a utility's disincentive to promote energy efficiency, and to recognize changes in sales attributable to weather, electric vehicles and other electrification, adoption of distributed energy resources, and other volatile or uncontrollable factors without adversely affecting utility customers.  

(b) For the purposes of this Section, "reconciliation period" means a period beginning with the January monthly billing period and extending through the December monthly billing period of the same calendar year.  

(c) As set forth in subsection (d) of this Section, the Commission shall approve a tariff by which distribution revenues shall be compared annually to the revenue requirement or requirements approved by the Commission on which the rates giving rise to those revenues were based to prevent undercollections or overcollections. An electric utility shall submit an annual revenue balancing reconciliation report to the Commission reflecting the difference between the actual delivery service revenue and multi-year rate case revenue requirement for the applicable reconciliation and identifying the charges or credits to be applied thereafter. Such reconciliation and calculation of associated charges or credits shall be conducted on a customer class basis. The annual revenue balancing reconciliation report shall be filed with the Commission no later than March 20 of the year following a reconciliation period. The Commission may initiate a review of the revenue balancing reconciliation report each year to determine if any subsequent adjustment is necessary to align actual delivery service revenue and rate case revenue requirement. If the Commission elects to initiate such review, the Commission shall, after notice and hearing, enter an order approving, or approving as modified, such revenue balancing reconciliation report no later than 120 days after the utility files its report with the Commission. If the Commission does not initiate such a review, the revenue balancing reconciliation report and the identified charges or credits shall be deemed accepted and approved 120 days after the utility files the report and shall not be subject to review in any other proceeding. Any balancing adjustment shall take effect during the following January monthly billing period.  

(d) Each electric utility shall file a tariff in compliance with the provisions of this Section within 120 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly. The Commission shall approve the tariff if it finds that it is consistent with the provisions of the Section. If the Commission does not so find, it shall approve the tariff with modification to conform it to the requirements of this Section or otherwise reject the tariff and explain how the utility can modify the tariff and refile to comply with the requirements of this Section.  

(220 ILCS 5/16-105.10 new)  

Sec. 16-105.10. Independent baseline assessment.  

(a) Prior to the filing of the initial Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan described in Section 16-105.17 of this Act, the General Assembly finds that an independent audit of the current state of the grid, and of the expenditures made since 2012, will need to be made.  

Specifically, the General Assembly finds:  

(1) Pursuant to the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act and subsequent clarifying legislation, electric utilities in this State that serve over 300,000 retail customers have made substantial investments in the grid and advanced metering infrastructure.  

(2) Before a Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan is filed under Section 16-105.17, it is necessary to understand the benefits of these investments to the grid and to customers and to evaluate the current condition of the distribution grid.  

(3) It is also necessary for electric utilities, the Commission, and stakeholders to have an independently verified set of data to establish the baseline for future distribution grid spending.  

(4) The Commission has authority to order and implement the requirements of this Section under Section 8-102 of this Act.  

(b) Terms used in this Section have the meanings given to those terms in Sections 16-102, 16-107.6, and 16-108 of this Act.  

(c) Within 30 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, the Commission shall issue an order initiating an audit of each electric utility serving over 300,000 retail customers in the State, which shall examine the following:  

(1) An assessment of the distribution grid, as described in paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this Section. The Commission shall have the authority to require additional items which it deems necessary.  

(2) An analysis of the utility's capital projects placed into service in the preceding 9 years, including, but not limited to, assessing the value of deploying advanced metering infrastructure to modernize and optimize the grid and deliver value to customers.  

(3) An analysis of the utility's initiatives to optimize the reliability and resiliency of the grid, other than through capital spending.  

(4) Creation of a data baseline to inform the beginning of the multi-year integrated grid planning process described in Section 16-105.17 of this Act.  

(5) Identification of any deficiencies in data which may impact the planning process.  

(d) It is contemplated that the auditor will utilize materials filed with the Commission by the utilities with respect to their expenditures in the preceding 9 years; however, the auditor may also, with Commission approval, assess other information deemed necessary to make its report.  

(e) The results of the audit described in this Section shall be reflected in a report delivered to the Commission, describing the information specified in this Section. Such report is to be delivered no later than 180 days after the Commission enters its order pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section. It is understood that any public report may not contain items that are confidential or proprietary.  

(f) The costs of an electric utility's audit described in this Section shall not exceed \$500,000 and shall be paid for by the electric utility that is the subject of the audit. Such costs shall be a recoverable expense.  

(g) The Commission shall have the authority to retain the services of an auditor to assist with the distribution planning process, as well as in docketed proceedings. Such expenses for these activities shall also be borne by the Commission.  

(220 ILCS 5/16-105.17 new)  

Sec. 16-105.17. Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan.  

(a) The General Assembly finds that ensuring alignment of regulated utility operations, expenditures, and investments with public benefit goals, including safety, reliability, resiliency, affordability, equity, emissions reductions, and expansion of clean distributed energy resources, is critical to maximizing the benefits of the interconnected utility grid and cost-effective utility expenditures on the grid. It is the policy of the State to promote inclusive, comprehensive, transparent, cost-effective distribution system planning and disclosures processes that minimize long-term costs for Illinois customers and support the achievement of State renewable energy development and other clean energy, public health, and environmental policy goals. Utility distribution system expenditures, programs, investments, and policies must be evaluated in coordination with these goals. In particular, the General Assembly finds that:  

(1) Investment in infrastructure to support and enable existing and new distributed energy resources creates significant economic development, environmental, and public health benefits in the State.  

(2) Illinois' electricity distribution system must cost-effectively integrate renewable energy resources, including utility-scale renewable energy resources, community renewable generation, and distributed renewable energy resources, support beneficial electrification, including electric vehicle use and adoption, promote opportunities for third-party investment in nontraditional, grid-related technologies and resources such as batteries, solar photovoltaic panels, and smart thermostats, reduce energy usage generally and especially during times of greatest reliance on fossil fuels, and enhance customer engagement opportunities.  

(3) Inclusive distribution system planning is an essential tool for the Commission, public utilities, and stakeholders to effectively coordinate environmental, consumer, reliability, and equity goals at fair and reasonable costs, and for ensuring transparent utility accountability for meeting those goals.  

(4) Any planning process should advance Illinois energy policy goals while ensuring utility investments are cost-effective. Such a process should maximize the sharing of information, minimize overlap with existing filing requirements to ensure robust stakeholder participation, and recognize the responsibility of the utility to manage the grid in a safe, reliable manner.  

(5) The General Assembly is concerned that, in the absence of a transparent, meaningful distribution system planning process, utility investments may not always serve customers' best interests, appropriately promote the expansion of clean distributed energy resources, and advance equity and environmental justice.  

(6) The General Assembly is also encouraged by the opportunities presented by nontraditional solutions to utility, customer, and grid needs that may be more efficient and cost-effective, and less environmentally harmful than traditional solutions. Nontraditional solutions include distributed energy resources owned or implemented by customers and independent third parties, controllable load, beneficial electrification, or rate design that encourages efficient energy use.  

(7) The General Assembly finds that Illinois utilities' current processes for planning their distribution system should be made more accessible and transparent to individuals and communities, and that more inclusive and accessible distribution system planning processes would be in the interests of all Illinois residents.  

(8) The General Assembly finds it would be beneficial to require utilities to demonstrate how their spending promotes identified State clean energy goals, such as integrating renewable energy, empowering customers to make informed choices, supporting electric vehicles, beneficial electrification, and energy storage, achieving equity goals, enhancing resilience, and maintaining reliability.  

The General Assembly therefore directs the utilities to implement distribution system planning as described in this Section in order to accelerate progress on Illinois clean energy and environmental goals and hold electric utilities publicly accountable for their performance.  

(b) Unless otherwise specified, the terms used in this Section shall have the same meanings as defined in Sections 16-102 and 16-107.6. As used in this Section:  

"Demand response" means measures that decrease peak electricity demand or shift demand from peak to off-peak periods.  

"Distributed energy resources" or "DER" means a wide range of technologies that are connected to the grid, including those that are located on the customer side of the customer's electric meter and can provide value to the distribution system, including, but not limited to, distributed generation, energy storage, electric vehicles, and demand response technologies.  

"Environmental justice communities" means the definition  

blic Act 102-0662 2408 Enrolled LRB102 11366 BMS 16699 b that term based on existing methodologies and findings, used and as may be updated by the Illinois Power Agency and its ogram Administrator in the Illinois Solar for All Program. (c) This Section applies to electric utilities serving re than 500,000 retail customers in the State. (d) The Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan ("the Plan") shall designed to: (1) ensure coordination of the State's renewable energy goals, climate and environmental goals with the utility's distribution system investments, and programs and policies over a 5-year planning horizon to maximize the benefits of each while ensuring utility expenditures are cost-effective; (2) optimize utilization of electricity grid assets and resources to minimize total system costs; (3) support efforts to bring the benefits of grid modernization and clean energy, including, but not limited to, deployment of distributed energy resources, to all retail customers, and support efforts to bring at least 40% of the benefits of those benefits to Equity Investment Eligible Communities. Nothing in this paragraph is meant to require a specific amount of spending in a particular geographic area; (4) enable greater customer engagement, empowerment, and options for energy services; (5) reduce grid congestion, minimize the time and expense associated with interconnection, and increase the capacity of the distribution grid to host increasing levels of distributed energy resources, to facilitate availability and development of distributed energy resources, particularly in locations that enhance consumer and environmental benefits;  

(6) ensure opportunities for robust public participation through open, transparent planning processes.  

(7) provide for the analysis of the cost-effectiveness of proposed system investments, which takes into account environmental costs and benefits;  

(8) to the maximum extent practicable, achieve or support the achievement of Illinois environmental goals, including those described in Section 9.10 of the Environmental Protection Act and Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, and emissions reductions required to improve the health, safety, and prosperity of all Illinois residents;  

(9) support existing Illinois policy goals promoting   
the long-term growth of energy efficiency, demand   
response, and investments in renewable energy resources; (10) provide sufficient public information to the   
Commission, stakeholders, and market participants in order   
to enable nonemitting customer-owned or third-party   
distributed energy resources, acting individually or in  

aggregate, to seamlessly and easily connect to the grid, provide grid benefits, support grid services, and achieve environmental outcomes, without necessarily requiring utility ownership or controlling interest over those resources, and enable those resources to act as alternatives to utility capital investments; and  

(11) provide delivery services at rates that are affordable to all customers, including low-income customers.  

(e) Plan Development Stakeholder Process.  

(1) To promote the transparency of utility distributions system planned investments and the planning process for those investments, the Commission shall convene a workshop process, over a period of no less than 5 months, for each such utility for the purpose of establishing an open, inclusive, and cooperative forum regarding such investments. The workshops shall be facilitated by an independent, third-party facilitator selected by the Commission. Data and projections provided through the workshop process shall be designed to provide participants with information about the electric utility's historic distribution system investments for at least the 5 years prior to the year in which the workshop is held and (ii) planned investments for the 5-year period following the year in which the workshop is held. The workshop process shall recognize that estimates for later LRB102 11366 BMS 16699 b   
years will be less reliable and indicative of future   
conduct than estimates for earlier years and that the ectric utility is subject to financial and system   
planning processes. No later than January 1, 2022, the cilitator shall initiate a series of workshops for each   
electric utility subject to this Section. The series of   
workshops shall include no fewer than 6 workshops and   
shall conclude no later than June 1, 2022. (2) The workshops shall be designed to achieve the llowing objectives: (A) review utilities' planned capital investments and supporting data; (B) review how utilities plan to invest in their distribution system in order to meet the system's projected needs; (C) review system and locational data on reliability, resiliency, DER, and service quality provided by the utilities; (D) solicit and consider input from diverse stakeholders, including representatives from environmental justice communities, geographically diverse communities, low-income representatives, consumer representatives, environmental representatives, organized labor representatives, third-party technology providers, and utilities; (E) consider proposals from utilities and  

stakeholders on programs and policies necessary to achieve the objectives in subsection (d) of this Section;  

(F) consider proposals applicable to each component of the utilities' Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan filings under paragraph (2) of subsection (f) of this Section;  

(G) educate and equip interested stakeholders so that they can effectively and efficiently provide feedback and input to the electric utility; and  

(H) review planned capital investment to ensure that delivery services are provided at rates that are affordable to all customers, including low-income customers.  

(3) To the extent any of the information in subparagraphs (A) through (H) of paragraph (2) of this subsection is designated as confidential and proprietary under the Commission's rules, the proponent of the designation shall have the burden of making the requisite showing under the Commission's rules. For data that is determined to be confidential or that includes personally identifiable information, the Commission may develop procedures and processes to enable data sharing with parties and stakeholders while ensuring the confidentiality of the information.  

(4) Workshops should be organized and facilitated in a manner that encourages representation from diverse stakeholders, ensuring equitable opportunities for participation, without requiring formal intervention or representation by an attorney. Workshops should be held during both day and evening hours, in a variety of locations within each electric utility's service territory, and should allow remote participation.  

(5) It is a goal of the State that this workshop process will provide a forum for interested stakeholders to effectively and efficiently provide feedback and input to the electric utility. It is also a goal of the State that stakeholder participation in this process will prepare stakeholders to more capably participate in Multi-Year Rate Plan proceedings conducted pursuant to Section 16-108.18 of this Act, if they so elect. As part of the workshop process, the electric utility shall submit to the Commission the electric utility's capital investments proposal, and supporting data described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of paragraph (2) of this subsection (e) before the start of workshops to allow interested stakeholders to reasonably review data before attending workshops. The Commission shall make public the utility capital investments proposal by posting it on the Commission's website and set the location and time of any workshop to be held as part of the workshop process, and establish a data request process, consistent with the  

Commission's rules, that affords workshop participants opportunities to submit data requests to the utility, and receive responses in accordance with the utility's obligations under the law, prior to the workshop, regarding the information described in this paragraph (5). Upon the written request of a workshop participant, the utility shall also present at a given workshop at least one appropriate company representative who can address the specific written questions or written categories of questions identified in advance by the workshop participant regarding issues related to the utility's Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan. To facilitate public feedback, the administrator facilitating the workshops shall, throughout the workshop process, develop questions for stakeholder input on topics being considered. This may include, but is not limited to: design of the workshop process, locational data and information provided by utilities, alignment of plans, programs, investments and objectives, and other topics as deemed appropriate by the Commission facilitation staff. Stakeholder feedback shall not be limited to these questions. The information provided as part of the workshop process pursuant to this subsection (e) is intended to be informational and to provide a preliminary view of costs and investments, which may change. Accordingly, the information provided pursuant to this subsection (e) shall not be binding on the utility and shall not be the sole basis for a finding in any Commission proceeding of imprudence, unreasonableness, or lack of use or usefulness of any individual or aggregate level of utility plant or other investment or expenditure addressed; however, information contained in the plan may be used in a proceeding before the Commission, with weight of such evidence to be determined by the Commission.  

(6) Workshops shall not be considered settlement negotiations, compromise negotiations, or offers to compromise for the purposes of Illinois Rule of Evidence 408. All materials shared as a part of the workshop process, and that are not determined to be confidential as described in paragraph (3) of this subsection (e), shall be made publicly available on a website made available by the Commission.  

(7) On conclusion of the workshops, the Commission shall open a comment period that allows interested and diverse stakeholders to submit comments and recommendations regarding the utility's Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan filing. Based on the workshop process and stakeholder comments and recommendations offered verbally or in writing during the workshops and in writing during the comment period following the workshops, the independent third-party facilitator shall prepare a report, to be submitted to the Commission no later than July 1, 2022, describing the stakeholders, discussions, proposals, and areas of consensus and disagreement from the workshop process, and making recommendations to the Commission regarding the utility's Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan. Interested stakeholders shall have an opportunity to provide comment on the independent third-party facilitator report.  

(8) Based on discussions in the workshops, the independent third-party facilitator report, and stakeholder comments and recommendations made during and following the workshop process, the Commission shall issue initiating orders no later than August 1, 2022, requiring the electric utilities subject to this Section to file the first Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan no later than January 20, 2023. The initiating orders shall specify the requirements applicable to the utilities' Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plans, which shall supplement and not replace those requirements described in subsection (f) of this Section.  

(f) Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan.  

(1) Pursuant to this subsection (f) and the initiating   
orders of the Commission, each electric utility subject to   
this Section shall, no later than January 20, 2023, submit   
its first Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan. No later than   
January 20, 2026, and every 4 years thereafter, the   
utility shall submit its subsequent Plan. Each Plan shall: (A) incorporate requirements established by the Commission in its initiating order; and   
(B) propose distribution system investment programs, policies, and plans designed to optimize achievement of the objectives set forth in subsection (d) of this Section and achieve the metrics approved by the Commission pursuant to Section 16-108.18 of this Act.  

To the extent practicable and reasonable, all programs, policies, and initiatives proposed by the utility in its plan should be informed by stakeholder input received during the workshop process pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section. Where specific stakeholder input has not been incorporated in proposed programs, policies, and plans, the electric utility shall provide an explanation as to why that input was not incorporated.  

(2) In order to ensure electric utilities' ability to meet the goals and objectives set forth in this Section, the Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plans must include, at minimum, the following information:  

(A) A description of the utility's distribution system planning process, including:  

(i) the overview of the process, including   
frequency and duration of the process, roles, and   
responsibilities of utility personnel and   
departments involved; (ii) a summary of the meetings with  

stakeholders conducted prior to filing of the plan with the Commission.  

(iii) the description of any coordination of the processes with any other planning process internal or external to the utility, including those required by a regional transmission operator.  

(B) A detailed description of the current operating conditions for the distribution system separately presented for each of the utility's operating areas, where possible, including a detailed description, with supporting data, of system conditions, including baseline data regarding the utility's distribution system from the utility's annual report to the Commission, total distribution system substation capacity in kVa, total miles of primary overhead distribution wire, and total miles of primary underground distribution cable, distributed energy resource deployment by type, size, customer class, and geographic dispersion as to those DERs that have completed the interconnection process, the most current distribution line loss study, current and expected System Average Interruption Frequency Index and Customer Average Interruption Duration Index data for the system, identification of the system model software currently used and planned software deployments, and other data needs as requested by the Commission or as determined through Commission rules.

Any party that fails to provide required notification of such a breach shall be subject to remedies available to the Commission and the Illinois Attorney General.  

(4) It is the policy of this State that holistic consideration of all related investments, planning processes, tariffs, rate design options, programs, and other utility policies and plans shall be required. To  

that end, the Commission shall consider, comprehensively,   
the impact of all related plans, tariffs, programs, and   
policies on the Plan and on each other, including: (A) time-of-use pricing program pursuant to Section 16-107.7 of this Act, hourly pricing program pursuant to Section 16-107 of this Act, and any other time-variant or dynamic pricing program; (B) distributed generation rebate pursuant to Section 16-107.6 of this Act; (C) net electricity metering, pursuant to Section 16-107.5 of this Act; (D) energy efficiency programs pursuant to Section 8-103B of this Act; (E) beneficial electrification programs pursuant to Section 16-107.8 of this Act; (F) Equitable Energy Upgrade Program pursuant to Section 16-111.10 of this Act; (G) renewable energy programs and procurements set forth in the Illinois Power Agency Act, including, but not limited to, those setforth forth in the long-term renewable resources procurement plan developed pursuant to Section 1-20 of that Act; and (H) other plans, programs, and policies that are relevant to distribution grid investments, costs, planning, and other categories as requested by the  

Commission.  

The Plan shall comprehensively detail the relationship between these plans, tariffs, and programs and to the electric utility's achievement of the objectives in subsection (d). The Plan shall be designed to coordinate each of these plans, programs, and tariffs with the electric utility's long-term distribution system investment planning in order to maximize the benefits of each.  

(5) The initiating order for the initial Multi-Year tegrated Grid Plan, as well as each electric utility's   
subsequent Integrated Grid Plans under subsection (g),   
shall begin a contested proceeding as described in   
subsection (d) of Section 10-101.1 of this Act. (A) In evaluating a utility's Plan, the Commission shall consider, at minimum, whether the Plan: (1) meets the objectives of this Section; (2) includes the components in paragraph (2) of subsection (f) of this Section; (3) considers and incorporates, where practicable, input from interested stakeholders, including parties and people who offer public comment without legal representation; (4) considers nontraditional, including third-party owned, investment alternatives that can meet grid needs and provide additional benefits (including consumer, economic, and   
environmental benefits) beyond comparable,   
traditional utility-planned capital investments; (5) equitably benefits environmental justice   
communities; and (6) maximizes consumer, environmental,   
economic, and community benefits over a 10-year   
horizon.  

(B) The Commission, after notice and hearing, shall modify each electric utility's Plan as necessary to comply with the objectives of this Section. The Commission may approve, or modify and approve, a Plan only if it finds that the Plan is reasonable, complies with the objectives and requirements of this Section, and reasonably incorporates input from parties. The Commission may reject each electric utility's Plan if it finds that the Plan does not comply with the objectives and requirements of this Section. If the Commission enters an order rejecting a Plan, the utility must refile a Plan within 3 months after that order, and until the Commission approves a Plan, the utility's existing Plan will remain in effect.  

(C) For the initial Integrated Grid Plan filings, the Commission shall enter an order approving, modifying, or rejecting the Plan no later than December 15, 2023. For subsequent Integrated Grid Plan filings, the Commission shall enter an order approving, modifying, or rejecting the Plan no later than December 15 of the year in which it was filed.  

(D) Each electric utility shall file its proposed Initial Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan no later than January 20, 2023. Prior to that date and following the initiating order, the Commission shall initiate a case management conference and shall take any appropriate steps to begin meaningful consideration of issues, including enabling interested parties to begin conducting discovery.  

(6) As part of its order approving a utility's Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan, including any modifications required, the Commission may create a subsequent implementation plan docket, or multiple implementation plan dockets, if the Commission determines that multiple dockets would be preferable, to consider a utility's detailed plan or plans, as directed in the Commission's order.  

(g) No later than January 20, 2026 and every 4 years thereafter, each electric utility subject to this Section shall file a new Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan for the subsequent 4 delivery years after the completion of the then-effective Plan. Each Plan shall meet the requirements described in subsection (f) of this Section, and shall be preceded by a workshop process which meets the same requirements described in subsection (e). If appropriate, the  

Commission may require additional implementation dockets to follow Subsequent Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan filings.  

(h) During the period leading to approval of the first Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan, each electric utility will necessarily continue to invest in its distribution grid. Those investments will be subject to a determination of prudence and reasonableness consistent with Commission practice and law. Any failure of such investments to conform to the Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan ultimately approved shall not imply imprudence or unreasonableness.  

(i) The Commission shall adopt rules to carry out the provisions of this Section under the emergency rulemaking provisions set forth in Section 5-45 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act, and such emergency rules may be effective no later than 90 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly.  

(220 ILCS 5/16-107.5)  

Sec. 16-107.5. Net electricity metering.  

(a) The General Assembly Legislature finds and declares that a program to provide net electricity metering, as defined in this Section, for eligible customers can encourage private investment in renewable energy resources, stimulate economic growth, enhance the continued diversification of Illinois' energy resource mix, and protect the Illinois environment. Further, to achieve the goals of this Act that robust options for customer-site distributed generation continue to thrive in Illinois, the General Assembly finds that a predictable transition must be ensured for customers between full net metering at the retail electricity rate to the distribution generation rebate described in Section 16-107.6.  

(b) As used in this Section, (i) "community renewable generation project" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 1-10 of the Illinois Power Agency Act; (ii) "eligible customer" means a retail customer that owns, hosts, or operates, including any third-party owned systems, a solar, wind, or other eligible renewable electrical generating facility with a rated capacity of not more than 2,000 kilowatts that is located on the customer's premises or customer's side of the billing meter and is intended primarily to offset the customer's own current or future electrical requirements; (iii) "electricity provider" means an electric utility or alternative retail electric supplier; (iv) "eligible renewable electrical generating facility" means a generator, which may include the co-location of an energy storage system, that is interconnected under rules adopted by the Commission and is powered by solar electric energy, wind, dedicated crops grown for electricity generation, agricultural residues, untreated and unadulterated wood waste, landscape trimmings, livestock manure, anaerobic digestion of livestock or food processing waste, fuel cells or microturbines powered by renewable fuels, or hydroelectric energy; (v) "net electricity metering" (or "net metering") means the measurement, during the billing period applicable to an eligible customer, of the net amount of electricity supplied by an electricity provider to the customer customer's premises or provided to the electricity provider by the customer or subscriber; (vi) "subscriber" shall have the meaning as set forth in Section 1-10 of the Illinois Power Agency Act; and (vii) "subscription" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 1-10 of the Illinois Power Agency Act; (viii) "energy storage system" means commercially available technology that is capable of absorbing energy and storing it for a period of time for use at a later time, including, but not limited to, electrochemical, thermal, and electromechanical technologies, and may be interconnected behind the customer's meter or interconnected behind its own meter; and (ix) "future electrical requirements" means modeled electrical requirements upon occupation of a new or vacant property, and other reasonable expectations of future electrical use, as well as, for occupied properties, a reasonable approximation of the annual load of 2 electric vehicles and, for non-electric heating customers, a reasonable approximation of the incremental electric load associated with fuel switching. The approximations shall be applied to the appropriate net metering tariff and do not need to be unique to each individual eligible customer. The utility shall submit these approximations to the Commission for review, modification, and  

approval.  

(c) A net metering facility shall be equipped with metering equipment that can measure the flow of electricity in both directions at the same rate.  

(1) For eligible customers whose electric service has not been declared competitive pursuant to Section 16-113 of this Act as of July 1, 2011 and whose electric delivery service is provided and measured on a kilowatt-hour basis and electric supply service is not provided based on hourly pricing, this shall typically be accomplished through use of a single, bi-directional meter. If the eligible customer's existing electric revenue meter does not meet this requirement, the electricity provider shall arrange for the local electric utility or a meter service provider to install and maintain a new revenue meter at the electricity provider's expense, which may be the smart meter described by subsection (b) of Section 16-108.5 of this Act.  

(2) For eligible customers whose electric service has not been declared competitive pursuant to Section 16-113 of this Act as of July 1, 2011 and whose electric delivery service is provided and measured on a kilowatt demand basis and electric supply service is not provided based on hourly pricing, this shall typically be accomplished through use of a dual channel meter capable of measuring the flow of electricity both into and out of the customer's facility at the same rate and ratio. If such customer's existing electric revenue meter does not meet this requirement, then the electricity provider shall arrange for the local electric utility or a meter service provider to install and maintain a new revenue meter at the electricity provider's expense, which may be the smart meter described by subsection (b) of Section 16-108.5 of this Act.  

(3) For all other eligible customers, until such time as the local electric utility installs a smart meter, as described by subsection (b) of Section 16-108.5 of this Act, the electricity provider may arrange for the local electric utility or a meter service provider to install and maintain metering equipment capable of measuring the flow of electricity both into and out of the customer's facility at the same rate and ratio, typically through the use of a dual channel meter. If the eligible customer's existing electric revenue meter does not meet this requirement, then the costs of installing such equipment shall be paid for by the customer.  

(d) An electricity provider shall measure and charge or credit for the net electricity supplied to eligible customers or provided by eligible customers whose electric service has not been declared competitive pursuant to Section 16-113 of this Act as of July 1, 2011 and whose electric delivery service is provided and measured on a kilowatt-hour basis and electric supply service is not provided based on hourly pricing in the following manner:  

(1) If the amount of electricity used by the customer during the billing period exceeds the amount of electricity produced by the customer, the electricity provider shall charge the customer for the net electricity supplied to and used by the customer as provided in subsection (e-5) of this Section.  

(2) If the amount of electricity produced by a customer during the billing period exceeds the amount of electricity used by the customer during that billing period, the electricity provider supplying that customer shall apply a 1:1 kilowatt-hour credit to a subsequent bill for service to the customer for the net electricity supplied to the electricity provider. The electricity provider shall continue to carry over any excess kilowatt-hour credits earned and apply those credits to subsequent billing periods to offset any customer-generator consumption in those billing periods until all credits are used or until the end of the annualized period.  

(3) At the end of the year or annualized over the period that service is supplied by means of net metering, or in the event that the retail customer terminates service with the electricity provider prior to the end of the year or the annualized period, any remaining credits in the customer's account shall expire.  

(d-5) An electricity provider shall measure and charge or credit for the net electricity supplied to eligible customers or provided by eligible customers whose electric service has not been declared competitive pursuant to Section 16-113 of this Act as of July 1, 2011 and whose electric delivery service is provided and measured on a kilowatt-hour basis and electric supply service is provided based on hourly pricing or time-of-use rates in the following manner:  

(1) If the amount of electricity used by the customer during any hourly period or time-of-use period exceeds the amount of electricity produced by the customer, the electricity provider shall charge the customer for the net electricity supplied to and used by the customer according to the terms of the contract or tariff to which the same customer would be assigned to or be eligible for if the customer was not a net metering customer.  

(2) If the amount of electricity produced by a customer during any hourly period or time-of-use period exceeds the amount of electricity used by the customer during that hourly period or time-of-use period, the energy provider shall apply a credit for the net kilowatt-hours produced in such period. The credit shall consist of an energy credit and a delivery service credit. The energy credit shall be valued at the same price per kilowatt-hour as the electric service provider would charge for kilowatt-hour energy sales during that same hourly period or time-of-use period. The delivery credit shall be equal to the net kilowatt-hours produced in such hourly period or time-of-use period times a credit that reflects all kilowatt-hour based charges in the customer's electric service rate, excluding energy charges.  

(e) An electricity provider shall measure and charge or credit for the net electricity supplied to eligible customers whose electric service has not been declared competitive pursuant to Section 16-113 of this Act as of July 1, 2011 and whose electric delivery service is provided and measured on a kilowatt demand basis and electric supply service is not provided based on hourly pricing in the following manner:  

(1) If the amount of electricity used by the customer during the billing period exceeds the amount of electricity produced by the customer, then the electricity provider shall charge the customer for the net electricity supplied to and used by the customer as provided in subsection (e-5) of this Section. The customer shall remain responsible for all taxes, fees, and utility delivery charges that would otherwise be applicable to the net amount of electricity used by the customer.  

(2) If the amount of electricity produced by a customer during the billing period exceeds the amount of electricity used by the customer during that billing period, then the electricity provider supplying that customer shall apply a 1:1 kilowatt-hour credit that reflects the kilowatt-hour based charges in the customer's electric service rate to a subsequent bill for service to the customer for the net electricity supplied to the electricity provider. The electricity provider shall continue to carry over any excess kilowatt-hour credits earned and apply those credits to subsequent billing periods to offset any customer-generator consumption in those billing periods until all credits are used or until the end of the annualized period.  

(3) At the end of the year or annualized over the period that service is supplied by means of net metering, or in the event that the retail customer terminates service with the electricity provider prior to the end of the year or the annualized period, any remaining credits in the customer's account shall expire.  

(e-5) An electricity provider shall provide electric service to eligible customers who utilize net metering at non-discriminatory rates that are identical, with respect to rate structure, retail rate components, and any monthly charges, to the rates that the customer would be charged if not a net metering customer. An electricity provider shall not charge net metering customers any fee or charge or require additional equipment, insurance, or any other requirements not specifically authorized by interconnection standards authorized by the Commission, unless the fee, charge, or other requirement would apply to other similarly situated customers who are not net metering customers. The customer will remain responsible for all taxes, fees, and utility delivery charges that would otherwise be applicable to the net amount of electricity used by the customer. Subsections (c) through (e) of this Section shall not be construed to prevent an arms-length agreement between an electricity provider and an eligible customer that sets forth different prices, terms, and conditions for the provision of net metering service, including, but not limited to, the provision of the appropriate metering equipment for non-residential customers.  

(f) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsections (c) through (e-5) of this Section, an electricity provider must require dual-channel metering for customers operating eligible renewable electrical generating facilities with a nameplate rating up to 2,000 kilowatts and to whom the provisions of neither subsection (d), (d-5), nor (e) of this Section apply. In such cases, electricity charges and credits shall be determined as follows:  

(1) The electricity provider shall assess and the customer remains responsible for all taxes, fees, and utility delivery charges that would otherwise be applicable to the gross amount of kilowatt-hours supplied to the eligible customer by the electricity provider.  

(2) Each month that service is supplied by means of dual-channel metering, the electricity provider shall compensate the eligible customer for any excess kilowatt-hour credits at the electricity provider's avoided cost of electricity supply over the monthly period or as otherwise specified by the terms of a power-purchase agreement negotiated between the customer and electricity provider.  

(3) For all eligible net metering customers taking service from an electricity provider under contracts or tariffs employing hourly or time-of-use time of use rates, any monthly consumption of electricity shall be calculated according to the terms of the contract or tariff to which the same customer would be assigned to or be eligible for if the customer was not a net metering customer. When those same customer-generators are net generators during any discrete hourly or time-of-use time of use period, the net kilowatt-hours produced shall be valued at the same price per kilowatt-hour as the electric service provider would charge for retail kilowatt-hour sales during that same time-of-use time of use period.  

(g) For purposes of federal and State laws providing renewable energy credits or greenhouse gas credits, the eligible customer shall be treated as owning and having title to the renewable energy attributes, renewable energy credits, and greenhouse gas emission credits related to any electricity produced by the qualified generating unit. The electricity provider may not condition participation in a net metering program on the signing over of a customer's renewable energy credits; provided, however, this subsection (g) shall not be construed to prevent an arms-length agreement between an electricity provider and an eligible customer that sets forth the ownership or title of the credits.  

(h) Within 120 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 95th General Assembly, the Commission shall establish standards for net metering and, if the Commission has not already acted on its own initiative, standards for the interconnection of eligible renewable generating equipment to the utility system. The interconnection standards shall address any procedural barriers, delays, and administrative costs associated with the interconnection of customer-generation while ensuring the safety and reliability of the units and the electric utility system. The Commission shall consider the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard 1547 and the issues of (i) reasonable and fair fees and costs, (ii) clear timelines for major milestones in the interconnection process, (iii) nondiscriminatory terms of agreement, and (iv) any best practices for interconnection of distributed generation.  

(h-5) Within 90 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, the Commission shall:  

(1) establish an Interconnection Working Group. The  

LRB102 11366 BMS 16699 b rking group shall include representatives from electric   
utilities, developers of renewable electric generating cilities, other industries that regularly apply for   
interconnection with the electric utilities,   
representatives of distributed generation customers, the mmission Staff, and such other stakeholders with a   
substantial interest in the topics addressed by the terconnection Working Group. The Interconnection Working oup shall address at least the following issues: (A) cost and best available technology for interconnection and metering, including the standardization and publication of standard costs; (B) transparency, accuracy and use of the distribution interconnection queue and hosting capacity maps; (C) distribution system upgrade cost avoidance through use of advanced inverter functions; (D) predictability of the queue management process and enforcement of timelines; (E) benefits and challenges associated with group studies and cost sharing; (F) minimum requirements for application to the interconnection process and throughout the interconnection process to avoid queue clogging behavior; (G) process and customer service for  

SB2408 Enrolled LRB102 11366 BMS 16699 b interconnecting customers adopting distributed energy resources, including energy storage; (H) options for metering distributed energy resources, including energy storage; (I) interconnection of new technologies, including smart inverters and energy storage; (J) collect, share, and examine data on Level 1 interconnection costs, including cost and type of upgrades required for interconnection, and use this data to inform the final standardized cost of Level 1 interconnection; and (K) such other technical, policy, and tariff issues related to and affecting interconnection performance and customer service as determined by the Interconnection Working Group. The Commission may create subcommittees of the nterconnection Working Group to focus on specific issues importance, as appropriate. The Interconnection Working oup shall report to the Commission on recommended mprovements to interconnection rules and tariffs and licies as determined by the Interconnection Working oup at least every 6 months. Such reports shall include nsensus recommendations of the Interconnection Working oup and, if applicable, additional recommendations for ich consensus was not reached. The Commission shall use the he report from the Interconnection Working Group to  

determine whether processes should be commenced to   
formally codify or implement the recommendations; (2) create or contract for an Ombudsman to resolve   
interconnection disputes through non-binding arbitration.   
The Ombudsman may be paid in full or in part through fees   
levied on the initiators of the dispute; and (3) determine a single standardized cost for Level 1   
interconnections, which shall not exceed \$200.  

(i) All electricity providers shall begin to offer net metering no later than April 1, 2008.  

(j) An electricity provider shall provide net metering to eligible customers according to subsections (d), (d-5), and (e). Eligible renewable electrical generating facilities for which eligible customers registered for net metering before January 1, 2025 shall continue to receive net metering services according to subsections (d), (d-5), and (e) of this Section for the lifetime of the system, regardless of whether those retail customers change electricity providers or whether the retail customer benefiting from the system changes. On and after January 1, 2025, any eligible customer that applies for net metering and previously would have qualified under subsections (d), (d-5), or (e) shall only be eligible for net metering as described in subsection (n). until the load of its net metering customers equals 5% of the total peak demand supplied by that electricity provider during the previous year. After such time as the load of the electricity provider's net metering customers equals 5% of the total peak demand supplied by that electricity provider during the previous year, eligible customers that begin taking net metering shall only be eligible for netting of energy.  

(k) Each electricity provider shall maintain records and report annually to the Commission the total number of net metering customers served by the provider, as well as the type, capacity, and energy sources of the generating systems used by the net metering customers. Nothing in this Section shall limit the ability of an electricity provider to request the redaction of information deemed by the Commission to be confidential business information.  

(l)(1) Notwithstanding the definition of "eligible customer" in item (ii) of subsection (b) of this Section, each electricity provider shall allow net metering as set forth in this subsection (l) and for the following projects, provided that only electric utilities serving more than 200,000 customers as of January 1, 2021 shall provide net metering for projects that are eligible for subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (1) and have energized after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly:  

(A) properties owned or leased by multiple customers that contribute to the operation of an eligible renewable electrical generating facility through an ownership or leasehold interest of at least 200 watts in such facility, such as a community-owned wind project, a community-owned biomass project, a community-owned solar project, or a community methane digester processing livestock waste from multiple sources, provided that the facility is also located within the utility's service territory;  

(B) individual units, apartments, or properties located in a single building that are owned or leased by multiple customers and collectively served by a common eligible renewable electrical generating facility, such as an office or apartment building, a shopping center or strip mall served by photovoltaic panels on the roof; and  

(C) subscriptions to community renewable generation projects, including community renewable generation projects on the customer's side of the billing meter of a host facility and partially used for the customer's own load.  

In addition, the nameplate capacity of the eligible renewable electric generating facility that serves the demand of the properties, units, or apartments identified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection (l) shall not exceed 5,000 2,000 kilowatts in nameplate capacity in total. Any eligible renewable electrical generating facility or community renewable generation project that is powered by photovoltaic electric energy and installed after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly must be installed by a qualified person in compliance with the requirements of Section 16-128A of the Public Utilities Act and any rules or  

regulations adopted thereunder.  

(2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, an electricity provider shall provide credits for the electricity produced by the projects described in paragraph (1) of this subsection (l). The electricity provider shall provide credits that include at least energy supply, capacity, transmission, and, if applicable, the purchased energy adjustment at the subscriber's energy supply rate on the subscriber's monthly bill equal to the subscriber's share of the production of electricity from the project, as determined by paragraph (3) of this subsection (l). For customers with transmission or capacity charges not charged on a kilowatt-hour basis, the electricity provider shall prepare a reasonable approximation of the kilowatt-hour equivalent value and provide that value as a monetary credit. The electricity provider shall submit these approximation methodologies to the Commission for review, modification, and approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, customers on payment plans or participating in budget billing programs shall have credits applied on a monthly basis.   
(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary and  

regardless of whether a subscriber to an eligible community renewable generation project receives power and energy service from the electric utility or an alternative retail electric supplier, for projects eligible under paragraph (C) of subparagraph (1) of this subsection (l), electric utilities serving more than 200,000 customers as of January 1, 2021 shall provide the monetary credits to a subscriber's subsequent bill for the electricity produced by community renewable generation projects. The electric utility shall provide monetary credits to a subscriber's subsequent bill at the utility's total price to compare equal to the subscriber's share of the production of electricity from the project, as determined by paragraph (5) of this subsection (l). For the purposes of this subsection, "total price to compare" means the rate or rates published by the Illinois Commerce Commission for energy supply for eligible customers receiving supply service from the electric utility, and shall include energy, capacity, transmission, and the purchased energy adjustment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, customers on payment plans or participating in budget billing programs shall have credits applied on a monthly basis. Any applicable credit or reduction in load obligation from the production of the community renewable generating projects receiving a credit under this subsection shall be credited to the electric utility to offset the cost of providing the credit. To the extent that the credit or load obligation reduction does not completely offset the cost of providing the credit to subscribers of community renewable generation projects as described in this subsection, the electric utility may recover the remaining costs through its Multi-Year Rate Plan. All electric utilities serving 200,000 or fewer customers as of January 1, 2021 shall only provide the monetary credits to a subscriber's subsequent bill for the electricity produced by community renewable generation projects if the subscriber receives power and energy service from the electric utility. Alternative retail electric suppliers providing power and energy service to a subscriber located within the service territory of an electric utility not subject to Sections 16-108.18 and 16-118 shall provide the monetary credits to the subscriber's subsequent bill for the electricity produced by community renewable generation projects.  

(4) If requested by the owner or operator of a community renewable generating project, an electric utility serving more than 200,000 customers as of January 1, 2021 shall enter into a net crediting agreement with the owner or operator to include a subscriber's subscription fee on the subscriber's monthly electric bill and provide the subscriber with a net credit equivalent to the total bill credit value for that generation period minus the subscription fee, provided the subscription fee is structured as a fixed percentage of bill credit value. The net crediting agreement shall set forth payment terms from the electric utility to the owner or operator of the community renewable generating project, and the electric utility may charge a net crediting fee to the owner or operator of a community renewable generating project that may not exceed 2% of the bill credit value. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, an electric utility serving 200,000 customers or fewer as of January 1, 2021 shall not be obligated to enter into a net crediting agreement with the owner or operator of a community renewable generating project.  

(5) (3) For the purposes of facilitating net metering, the owner or operator of the eligible renewable electrical generating facility or community renewable generation project shall be responsible for determining the amount of the credit that each customer or subscriber participating in a project under this subsection (l) is to receive in the following manner:  

(A) The owner or operator shall, on a monthly basis, provide to the electric utility the kilowatthours of generation attributable to each of the utility's retail customers and subscribers participating in projects under this subsection (l) in accordance with the customer's or subscriber's share of the eligible renewable electric generating facility's or community renewable generation project's output of power and energy for such month. The owner or operator shall electronically transmit such calculations and associated documentation to the electric utility, in a format or method set forth in the applicable tariff, on a monthly basis so that the electric utility can reflect the monetary credits on customers' and subscribers' electric utility bills. The electric utility shall be permitted to revise its tariffs to implement the provisions of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly. The owner or operator shall separately provide the electric utility with the documentation detailing the calculations supporting the credit in the manner set forth in the applicable tariff.  

(B) For those participating customers and subscribers who receive their energy supply from an alternative retail electric supplier, the electric utility shall remit to the applicable alternative retail electric supplier the information provided under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (3) for such customers and subscribers in a manner set forth in such alternative retail electric supplier's net metering program, or as otherwise agreed between the utility and the alternative retail electric supplier. The alternative retail electric supplier shall then submit to the utility the amount of the charges for power and energy to be applied to such customers and subscribers, including the amount of the credit associated with net metering.  

(C) A participating customer or subscriber may provide authorization as required by applicable law that directs the electric utility to submit information to the owner or operator of the eligible renewable electrical generating facility or community renewable generation project to which the customer or subscriber has an ownership or leasehold interest or a subscription. Such information shall be limited to the components of the net metering credit calculated under this subsection (l), including the bill credit rate, total kilowatthours, and total monetary credit value applied to the customer's or subscriber's bill for the monthly billing period.  

(l-5) Within 90 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly, each electric utility subject to this Section shall file a tariff or tariffs to implement the provisions of subsection (l) of this Section, which shall, consistent with the provisions of subsection (l), describe the terms and conditions under which owners or operators of qualifying properties, units, or apartments may participate in net metering. The Commission shall approve, or approve with modification, the tariff within 120 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly.  

(m) Nothing in this Section shall affect the right of an electricity provider to continue to provide, or the right of a retail customer to continue to receive service pursuant to a contract for electric service between the electricity provider and the retail customer in accordance with the prices, terms, and conditions provided for in that contract. Either the electricity provider or the customer may require compliance with the prices, terms, and conditions of the contract.  

(n) On and after January 1, 2025 At such time, if any, that the load of the electricity provider's net metering customers equals 5% of the total peak demand supplied by that electricity provider during the previous year, as specified in subsection (j) of this Section, the net metering services described in subsections (d), (d-5), and (e), (e-5), and (f) of this Section shall no longer be offered, except as to those eligible renewable electrical generating facilities for which retail customers that are receiving net metering service under these subsections at the time the net metering services under those subsections are no longer offered; those systems shall continue to receive net metering services described in subsections (d), (d-5), and (e) of this Section for the lifetime of the system, regardless of if those retail customers change electricity providers or whether the retail customer benefiting from the system changes. The electric utility serving more than 200,000 customers as of January 1, 2021 is responsible for ensuring the billing credits continue without lapse for the lifetime of systems, as required in subsection (o). Those retail customers that begin taking net metering service after the date that net metering services are no longer offered under such subsections shall be subject to the provisions set forth in the following paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subsection (n):   
(1) An electricity provider shall charge or credit for  

the net electricity supplied to eligible customers or provided by eligible customers whose electric supply service is not provided based on hourly pricing in the following manner:  

(A) If the amount of electricity used by the customer during the monthly billing period exceeds the amount of electricity produced by the customer, then the electricity provider shall charge the customer for the net kilowatt-hour based electricity charges reflected in the customer's electric service rate supplied to and used by the customer as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection (n).  

(B) If the amount of electricity produced by a customer during the monthly billing period exceeds the amount of electricity used by the customer during that billing period, then the electricity provider supplying that customer shall apply a 1:1 kilowatt-hour energy or monetary credit kilowatt-hour supply charges to the customer's subsequent bill. The customer shall choose between 1:1 kilowatt-hour or monetary credit at the time of application. For the purposes of this subsection, "kilowatt-hour supply charges" means the kilowatt-hour equivalent values for energy, capacity, transmission, and the purchased energy adjustment, if applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, customers on payment plans or participating in budget billing programs shall have credits applied on a monthly basis. that reflects the kilowatt-hour based energy charges in the customer's electric service rate to a subsequent bill for service to the customer for the net electricity supplied to the electricity provider. The electricity provider shall continue to carry over any excess kilowatt-hour or monetary energy credits earned and apply those credits to subsequent billing periods. For customers with transmission or capacity charges not charged on a kilowatt-hour basis, the electricity provider shall prepare a reasonable approximation of the kilowatt-hour equivalent value and provide that value as a monetary credit. The electricity provider shall submit these approximation methodologies to the Commission for review, modification, and approval. to offset any customer-generator consumption in those billing periods until all credits are used or until the end of the annualized period.  

(C) (Blank). At the end of the year or annualized over the period that service is supplied by means of net metering, or in the event that the retail customer terminates service with the electricity provider prior to the end of the year or the annualized period, any remaining credits in the customer's account shall expire.  

(2) An electricity provider shall charge or credit for the net electricity supplied to eligible customers or provided by eligible customers whose electric supply service is provided based on hourly pricing in the following manner:  

(A) If the amount of electricity used by the customer during any hourly period exceeds the amount of electricity produced by the customer, then the electricity provider shall charge the customer for the net electricity supplied to and used by the customer as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection (n).  

(B) If the amount of electricity produced by a customer during any hourly period exceeds the amount of electricity used by the customer during that hourly period, the energy provider shall calculate an energy credit for the net kilowatt-hours produced in such period, and shall apply that credit as a monetary credit to the customer's subsequent bill. The value of the energy credit shall be calculated using the same price per kilowatt-hour as the electric service provider would charge for kilowatt-hour energy sales during that same hourly period and shall also include values for capacity and transmission. For customers with transmission or capacity charges not charged on a kilowatt-hour basis, the electricity provider shall prepare a reasonable approximation of the kilowatt-hour equivalent value and provide that value as a monetary credit. The electricity provider shall submit these approximation methodologies to the Commission for review, modification, and approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, customers on payment plans or participating in budget billing programs shall have credits applied on a monthly basis.  

(3) An electricity provider shall provide electric service to eligible customers who utilize net metering at non-discriminatory rates that are identical, with respect to rate structure, retail rate components, and any monthly charges, to the rates that the customer would be charged if not a net metering customer. An electricity provider shall charge the customer for the net electricity supplied to and used by the customer according to the terms of the contract or tariff to which the same customer would be assigned or be eligible for if the customer was not a net metering customer. An electricity provider shall not charge net metering customers any fee or charge or require additional equipment, insurance, or any other requirements not specifically authorized by interconnection standards authorized by the Commission, unless the fee, charge, or other requirement would apply to other similarly situated customers who are not net metering customers. The charge or credit that the customer receives for net electricity shall be at a rate equal to the customer's energy supply rate. The customer remains responsible for the gross amount of delivery services charges, supply-related charges that are kilowatt based, and all taxes and fees related to such charges. The customer also remains responsible for all taxes and fees that would otherwise be applicable to the net amount of electricity used by the customer. Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection (n) shall not be construed to prevent an arms-length agreement between an electricity provider and an eligible customer that sets forth different prices, terms, and conditions for the provision of net metering service, including, but not limited to, the provision of the appropriate metering equipment for non-residential customers. Nothing in this paragraph (3) shall be interpreted to mandate that a utility that is only required to provide delivery services to a given customer must also sell electricity to such customer.  

(o) Within 90 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, each electric utility subject to this Section shall file a tariff, which shall, consistent with the provisions of this Section, propose the terms and conditions under which a customer may participate in net metering. The tariff for electric utilities serving more than 200,000 customers as of January 1, 2021 shall also provide a streamlined and transparent bill crediting system for net metering to be managed by the electric utilities. The terms and conditions shall include, but are not limited to, that an electric utility shall manage and maintain billing of net metering credits and charges regardless of if the eligible customer takes net metering under an electric utility or alternative retail electric supplier. The electric utility serving more than 200,000 customers as of January 1, 2021 shall process and approve all net metering applications, even if an eligible customer is served by an alternative retail electric supplier; and the utility shall forward application approval to the appropriate alternative retail electric supplier. Eligibility for net metering shall remain with the owner of the utility billing address such that, if an eligible renewable electrical generating facility changes ownership, the net metering eligibility transfers to the new owner. The electric utility serving more than 200,000 customers as of January 1, 2021 shall manage net metering billing for eligible customers to ensure full crediting occurs on electricity bills, including, but not limited to, ensuring net metering crediting begins upon commercial operation date, net metering billing transfers immediately if an eligible customer switches from an electric utility to alternative retail electric supplier or vice versa, and net metering billing transfers between ownership of a valid billing address. All transfers referenced in the preceding sentence shall include transfer of all banked credits. All electric utilities serving 200,000 or fewer customers as of January 1, 2021 shall manage net metering billing for eligible customers receiving power and energy service from the electric utility to ensure full crediting occurs on electricity bills, ensuring net metering crediting begins upon commercial operation date, net metering billing transfers immediately if an eligible customer switches from an electric utility to alternative retail electric supplier or vice versa, and net metering billing transfers between ownership of a valid billing address. Alternative retail electric suppliers providing power and energy service to eligible customers located within the service territory of an electric utility serving 200,000 or fewer customers as of January 1, 2021 shall manage net metering billing for eligible customers to ensure full crediting occurs on electricity bills, including, but not limited to, ensuring net metering crediting begins upon commercial operation date, net metering billing transfers immediately if an eligible customer switches from an electric utility to alternative retail electric supplier or vice versa, and net metering billing transfers between ownership of a valid billing address.

(c) The proposed tariff authorized by subsection (b) of this Section shall include the following participation terms for and formulae to calculate the value of the rebates to be applied under this Section for distributed generation that satisfies the criteria set forth in subsection (b) of this Section:  

(1) The owner or operator of distributed generation that services (1) Until the utility files its tariff or tariffs to place into effect the rebate values established by the Commission under subsection (e) of this Section, non-residential customers not eligible for net metering under subsection (d), (d-5), or (e) of Section 16-107.5 of this Act that are taking service under a net metering program offered by an electricity provider under the terms of Section 16-107.5 of this Act may apply for a rebate as provided for in this Section. Until the threshold date, the The value of the rebate shall be $\$250$ per kilowatt of nameplate generating capacity, measured as nominal DC power output, of that a non-residential customer's distributed generation. To the extent the distributed generation also has an associated energy storage, then the energy storage system shall be separately compensated with a base rebate of \$250 per kilowatt-hour of nameplate capacity. Any distributed generation device that is compensated for storage in this subsection (1) before the threshold date shall participate in one or more programs determined through the Multi-Year Integrated Grid Planning process that are designed to meet peak reduction and flexibility. After the threshold date, the value of the base rebate and additional compensation for any additive services shall be as determined by the Commission in the proceeding described in subsection (e) of this Section, provided that the value of the base rebate for system-wide grid services shall not be lower than \$250 per kilowatt of nameplate generating capacity of distributed generation or community renewable generation project.  

(2) The owner or operator of distributed generation that, before the threshold date, would have been eligible for net metering under subsection (d), (d-5), or (e) of Section 16-107.5 of this Act and that has not previously received a distributed generation rebate, may apply for a rebate as provided for in this Section. Until the threshold date, the value of the base rebate shall be \$300 per kilowatt of nameplate generating capacity, measured as nominal DC power output, of the distributed generation. The owner or operator of distributed generation that, before the threshold date, is eligible for net metering under subsection (d), (d-5), or (e) of Section 16-107.5 of this Act may apply for a base rebate for an energy storage device that uses the same smart inverter as the distributed generation, regardless of whether the distributed generation applies for a rebate for the distributed generation device. The energy storage system shall be separately compensated at a base payment of \$300 per kilowatt-hour of nameplate capacity. Any distributed generation device that is compensated for storage in this subsection (2) before the threshold date shall participate in a peak time rebate program, hourly pricing program, or time-of-use rate program offered by the applicable electric utility. After the threshold date, the value of the base rebate and additional compensation for any additive services shall be as determined by the Commission in the proceeding described in subsection (e) of this Section, provided that, prior to December 31, 2029, the value of the base rebate for system-wide services shall not be lower than \$300 per kilowatt of nameplate generating capacity of distributed generation, after which it shall not be lower than \$250 per kilowatt of nameplate  

capacity.  

(2) After the utility's tariff or tariffs setting the new rebate values established under subsection (d) of this Section take effect, retail customers may, as applicable, make the following elections:  

(A) Residential customers that are taking service under a net metering program offered by an electricity provider under the terms of Section 16-107.5 of this Act on the threshold date may elect to either continue to take such service under the terms of such program as in effect on such threshold date for the useful life of the customer's eligible renewable electric generating facility as defined in such Section, or file an application to receive a rebate under the terms of this Section, provided that such application must be submitted within 6 months after the effective date of the tariff approved under subsection (d) of this Section. The value of the rebate shall be the amount established by the Commission and reflected in the utility's tariff pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section.  

(B) Non-residential customers that are taking service under a net metering program offered by an electricity provider under the terms of Section 16-107.5 of this Act on the threshold date may apply for a rebate as provided for in this Section. The value of the rebate shall be the amount established by the Commission and reflected in the utility's tariff pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section.  

(3) Upon approval of a rebate application submitted under this subsection (c), the retail customer shall no longer be entitled to receive any delivery service credits for the excess electricity generated by its facility and shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (n) of Section 16-107.5 of this Act.  

(4) To be eligible for a rebate described in this subsection (c), the owner or operator of the distributed generation customers who begin taking service after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly under a net metering program offered by an electricity provider under the terms of Section 16-107.5 of this Act must have a smart inverter installed and in operation on the associated with the customer's distributed generation.  

(d) The Commission shall review the proposed tariff authorized by subsection submitted under subsections (b) and (c) of this Section and may make changes to the tariff that are consistent with this Section and with the Commission's authority under Article IX of this Act, subject to notice and hearing. Following notice and hearing, the Commission shall issue an order approving, or approving with modification, such tariff no later than 240 days after the utility files its tariff. Upon the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, an electric utility shall file a petition with the Commission to amend and update any existing tariffs to comply with subsections (b) and (c).  

(e) By no later than June 30, 2023, When the total generating capacity of the electricity provider's net metering customers is equal to 3%, the Commission shall open an independent, statewide investigation into the value of, and compensation for, distributed energy resources. The Commission shall conduct the investigation, but may arrange for experts or consultants independent of the utilities and selected by the Commission to assist with the investigation. The cost of the investigation shall be shared by the utilities filing tariffs under subsection (b) of this Section but may be recovered as an expense through normal ratemaking procedures. an annual process and formula for calculating the value of rebates for the retail customers described in subsections (b) and (f) of this Section that submit rebate applications after the threshold date for an electric utility that elected to file a tariff pursuant to this Section.  

(1) The Commission shall ensure that the investigation includes, at minimum, diverse sets of stakeholders; a review of best practices in calculating the value of distributed energy resource benefits; a review of the full value of the distributed energy resources and the manner in which each component of that value is or is not otherwise compensated; and assessments of how the value of distributed energy resources may evolve based on the present and future technological capabilities of distributed energy resources and based on present and future grid needs.  

(2) The Commission's final order concluding this investigation shall establish an annual process and formula for the compensation of distributed generation and energy storage systems, and an initial set of inputs for that formula. The Commission's final order concluding this investigation shall establish base rebates that compensate distributed generation, community renewable generation projects and energy storage systems for the system-wide grid services that they provide. Those base rebate values shall be consistent across the state, and shall not vary by customer, customer class, customer location, or any other variable. With respect to rebates for distributed generation or community renewable generation projects, that rebate shall not be lower than \$250 per kilowatt of nameplate generating capacity of the distributed generation or community renewable generation project. The Commission's final order concluding this proceeding shall also direct the utilities to update the formula, on an annual basis, with inputs derived from their integrated grid plans developed pursuant to Section 16-105.17. The base rebate shall be updated annually based on the annual updates to the formula inputs, but, with respect to rebates for distributed generation or community renewable generation projects, shall be no lower than \$250 per kilowatt of nameplate generating capacity of the distributed generation or community renewable generation project.  

(3) The Commission shall also determine, as a part of its investigation under this subsection, whether distributed energy resources can provide any additive services. Those additive services may include services that are provided through utility-controlled responses to grid conditions. If the Commission determines that distributed energy resources can provide additive grid services, the Commission shall determine the terms and conditions for the operation and compensation of those services. That compensation shall be above and beyond the base rebate that the distributed energy generation, community renewable generation project and energy storage system receives. Compensation for additive services may vary by location, time, performance characteristics, technology types, or other variables.  

(4) The Commission shall ensure that compensation for distributed energy resources, including base rebates and any payments for additive services, shall reflect all reasonably known and measurable values of the distributed generation over its full expected useful life.  

Compensation for additive services shall reflect, but shall not be limited to, any geographic, time-based, performance-based, and other benefits of distributed generation, as well as the present and future technological capabilities of distributed energy resources and present and future grid needs.  

(5) The Commission shall consider the electric utility's integrated grid plan developed pursuant to Section 16-105.17 of this Act to help identify the value of distributed energy resources for the purpose of calculating the compensation described in this subsection. (6) The Commission shall determine additional compensation for distributed energy resources that creates savings and value on the distribution system by being co-located or in close proximity to electric vehicle charging infrastructure in use by medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles, primarily serving environmental justice communities, as outlined in the utility integrated grid planning process under Section 16-105.17 of this Act. No later than 60 days after the Commission enters its   
final order under this subsection (e), each utility shall file   
its updated tariff or tariffs in compliance with the order,   
including new tariffs for the recovery of costs incurred under   
this subsection (e) that shall provide for volumetric-based   
cost recovery, and the Commission shall approve, or approve   
with modification, the tariff or tariffs within 240 days after  

the utility's filing.  

The investigation shall include diverse sets of stakeholders, calculations for valuing distributed energy resource benefits to the grid based on best practices, and assessments of present and future technological capabilities of distributed energy resources. The value of such rebates shall reflect the value of the distributed generation to the distribution system at the location at which it is interconnected, taking into account the geographic, time-based, and performance-based benefits, as well as technological capabilities and present and future grid needs. No later than 10 days after the Commission enters its final order under this subsection (e), the utility shall file its tariff or tariffs in compliance with the order, and the Commission shall approve, or approve with modification, the tariff or tariffs within 45 days after the utility's filing. For those rebate applications filed after the threshold date but before the utility's tariff or tariffs filed pursuant to this subsection (e) take effect, the value of the rebate shall remain at the value established in subsection (c) of this Section until the tariff is approved.  

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Act to the contrary, the owner or operator , developer, or subscriber of a community renewable generation project as defined in Section 1-10 of the Illinois Power Agency Act facility that is part of a net metering program provided under subsection (l) of  

Section 16-107.5 shall also be eligible to apply for the rebate described in this Section. The owner or operator of the community renewable A subscriber to the generation project facility may apply for a rebate in the amount of the subscriber's subscription only if the owner or operator, or previous owner or operator, of the community renewable generation project, developer, or previous subscriber to the same panel or panels has not already submitted an application, and, regardless of whether the subscriber is a residential or non-residential customer, may be allowed the amount identified in paragraph (1) of subsection (c) or in subsection (e) of this Section applicable to such customer on the date that the application is submitted. An application for a rebate for a portion of a project described in this subsection (f) may be submitted at or after the time that a related request for net metering is made.  

(g) The owner of the distributed generation or community renewable generation project may apply for the rebate or rebates approved under this Section at the time of execution of an interconnection agreement with the distribution utility and shall receive the value available at that time of execution of the interconnection agreement, provided the project reaches mechanical completion within 24 months after execution of the interconnection agreement. If the project has not reached mechanical completion within 24 months after execution, the owner may reapply for the rebate or rebates approved under this Section available at the time of application and shall receive the value available at the time of application. The utility shall issue the rebate no No later than 60 days after the project is energized. utility receives an application for a rebate under its tariff approved under subsection (d) or (e) of this Section, the utility shall issue a rebate to the applicant under the terms of the tariff. In the event the application is incomplete or the utility is otherwise unable to calculate the payment based on the information provided by the owner, the utility shall issue the payment no later than 60 days after the application is complete or all requested information is received.  

(h) An electric utility shall recover from its retail customers all of the costs of the rebates made under a tariff or tariffs approved under subsection (d) of placed into effect under this Section, including, but not limited to, the value of the rebates and all costs incurred by the utility to comply with and implement subsections (b) and (c) of this Section, but not including costs incurred by the utility to comply with and implement subsection (e) of this Section, consistent with the following provisions:  

(1) The utility shall defer the full amount of its costs incurred under this Section as a regulatory asset. The total costs deferred as a regulatory asset shall be amortized over a 15-year period. The unamortized balance shall be recognized as of December 31 for a given year. The utility shall also earn a return on the total of the unamortized balance of the regulatory assets, less any deferred taxes related to the unamortized balance, at an annual rate equal to the utility's weighted average cost of capital that includes, based on a year-end capital structure, the utility's actual cost of debt for the applicable calendar year and a cost of equity, which shall be calculated as the sum of (i) the average for the applicable calendar year of the monthly average yields of 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in its weekly H.15 Statistical Release or successor publication; and (ii) 580 basis points, including a revenue conversion factor calculated to recover or refund all additional income taxes that may be payable or receivable as a result of that return.  

When an electric utility creates a regulatory asset under the provisions of this paragraph (1) of subsection (h) Section, the costs are recovered over a period during which customers also receive a benefit, which is in the public interest. Accordingly, it is the intent of the General Assembly that an electric utility that elects to create a regulatory asset under the provisions of this paragraph (1) Section shall recover all of the associated costs, including, but not limited to, its cost of capital as set forth in this paragraph (1) Section. After the  

Commission has approved the prudence and reasonableness of the costs that comprise the regulatory asset, the electric utility shall be permitted to recover all such costs, and the value and recoverability through rates of the associated regulatory asset shall not be limited, altered, impaired, or reduced. To enable the financing of the incremental capital expenditures, including regulatory assets, for electric utilities that serve less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State, the utility's actual year-end capital structure that includes a common equity ratio, excluding goodwill, of up to and including $50\%$ of the total capital structure shall be deemed reasonable and used to set rates.  

(2) The utility, at its election, may recover all of the costs it incurs under this Section as part of a filing for a general increase in rates under Article IX of this Act, as part of an annual filing to update a performance-based formula rate under subsection (d) of Section 16-108.5 of this Act, or through an automatic adjustment clause tariff, provided that nothing in this paragraph (2) permits the double recovery of such costs from customers. If the utility elects to recover the costs it incurs under subsections (b) and (c) this Section through an automatic adjustment clause tariff, the utility may file its proposed tariff together with the tariff it files under subsection (b) of this Section or at a later time. The proposed tariff shall provide for an annual reconciliation, less any deferred taxes related to the reconciliation, with interest at an annual rate of return equal to the utility's weighted average cost of capital as calculated under paragraph (1) of this subsection (h), including a revenue conversion factor calculated to recover or refund all additional income taxes that may be payable or receivable as a result of that return, of the revenue requirement reflected in rates for each calendar year, beginning with the calendar year in which the utility files its automatic adjustment clause tariff under this subsection (h), with what the revenue requirement would have been had the actual cost information for the applicable calendar year been available at the filing date. The Commission shall review the proposed tariff and may make changes to the tariff that are consistent with this Section and with the Commission's authority under Article IX of this Act, subject to notice and hearing. Following notice and hearing, the Commission shall issue an order approving, or approving with modification, such tariff no later than 240 days after the utility files its tariff.  

(i) An electric utility shall recover from its retail customers, on a volumetric basis, all of the costs of the rebates made under a tariff or tariffs placed into effect under subsection (e) of this Section, including, but not limited to, the value of the rebates and all costs incurred by the utility to comply with and implement subsection (e) of this Section, consistent with the following provisions:  

(1) The utility may defer a portion of its costs as a regulatory asset. The Commission shall determine the portion that may be appropriately deferred as a regulatory asset. Factors that the Commission shall consider in determining the portion of costs that shall be deferred as a regulatory asset include, but are not limited to: (i) whether and the extent to which a cost effectively deferred or avoided other distribution system operating costs or capital expenditures; (ii) the extent to which a cost provides environmental benefits; (iii) the extent to which a cost improves system reliability or resilience; (iv) the electric utility's distribution system plan developed pursuant to Section 16-105.17 of this Act; (v) the extent to which a cost advances equity principles; and (vi) such other factors as the Commission deems appropriate. The remainder of costs shall be deemed an operating expense and shall be recoverable if found prudent and reasonable by the Commission.  

The total costs deferred as a regulatory asset shall be amortized over a 15-year period. The unamortized balance shall be recognized as of December 31 for a given year. The utility shall also earn a return on the total of the unamortized balance of the regulatory assets, less any deferred taxes related to the unamortized balance, at an annual rate equal to the utility's weighted average cost of capital that includes, based on a year-end capital structure, the utility's actual cost of debt for the applicable calendar year and a cost of equity, which shall be calculated as the sum of: (I) the average for the applicable calendar year of the monthly average yields of 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in its weekly H.15 Statistical Release or successor publication; and (II) 580 basis points, including a revenue conversion factor calculated to recover or refund all additional income taxes that may be payable or receivable as a result of that return.  

(2) The utility may recover all of the costs through an automatic adjustment clause tariff, on a volumetric basis. The utility may file its proposed cost-recovery tariff together with the tariff it files under subsection (e) of this Section or at a later time. The proposed tariff shall provide for an annual reconciliation, less any deferred taxes related to the reconciliation, with interest at an annual rate of return equal to the utility's weighted average cost of capital as calculated under paragraph (1) of this subsection (i), including a revenue conversion factor calculated to recover or refund all additional income taxes that may be payable or receivable as a result of that return, of the revenue requirement reflected in rates for each calendar year, beginning with the calendar year in which the utility files its automatic adjustment clause tariff under this subsection (i), with what the revenue requirement would have been had the actual cost information for the applicable calendar year been available at the filing date. The Commission shall review the proposed tariff and may make changes to the tariff that are consistent with this Section and with the Commission's authority under Article IX of this Act, subject to notice and hearing. Following notice and hearing, the Commission shall issue an order approving, or approving with modification, such tariff no later than 240 days after the utility files its tariff.  

(j) (i) No later than 90 days after the Commission enters an order, or order on rehearing, whichever is later, approving an electric utility's proposed tariff under subsection (d) of this Section, the electric utility shall provide notice of the availability of rebates under this Section. Subsequent to the utility's notice, any entity that offers in the State, for sale or lease, distributed generation and estimates the dollar saving attributable to such distributed generation shall provide estimates based on both delivery service credits and the rebates available under this Section.

Sec. 16-108. Recovery of costs associated with the provision of delivery and other services.  

(a) An electric utility shall file a delivery services tariff with the Commission at least 210 days prior to the date that it is required to begin offering such services pursuant to this Act. An electric utility shall provide the components of delivery services that are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission at the same prices, terms and conditions set forth in its applicable tariff as approved or allowed into effect by that Commission. The Commission shall otherwise have the authority pursuant to Article IX to review, approve, and modify the prices, terms and conditions of those components of delivery services not subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, including the authority to determine the extent to which such delivery services should be offered on an unbundled basis. In making any such determination the Commission shall consider, at a minimum, the effect of additional unbundling on (i) the objective of just and reasonable rates, (ii) electric utility employees, and (iii) the development of competitive markets for electric energy services in Illinois.  

(b) The Commission shall enter an order approving, or approving as modified, the delivery services tariff no later than 30 days prior to the date on which the electric utility must commence offering such services. The Commission may subsequently modify such tariff pursuant to this Act.  

(c) The electric utility's tariffs shall define the classes of its customers for purposes of delivery services charges. Delivery services shall be priced and made available to all retail customers electing delivery services in each such class on a nondiscriminatory basis regardless of whether the retail customer chooses the electric utility, an affiliate of the electric utility, or another entity as its supplier of electric power and energy. Charges for delivery services shall be cost based, and shall allow the electric utility to recover the costs of providing delivery services through its charges to its delivery service customers that use the facilities and services associated with such costs. Such costs shall include the costs of owning, operating and maintaining transmission and distribution facilities. The Commission shall also be authorized to consider whether, and if so to what extent, the following costs are appropriately included in the electric utility's delivery services rates: (i) the costs of that portion of generation facilities used for the production and absorption of reactive power in order that retail customers located in the electric utility's service area can receive electric power and energy from suppliers other than the electric utility, and (ii) the costs associated with the use and redispatch of generation facilities to mitigate constraints on the transmission or distribution system in order that retail customers located in the electric utility's service area can receive electric power and energy from suppliers other than the electric utility. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as directing the Commission to allocate any of the costs described in (i) or (ii) that are found to be appropriately included in the electric utility's delivery services rates to any particular customer group or geographic area in setting delivery services rates.  

(d) The Commission shall establish charges, terms and conditions for delivery services that are just and reasonable and shall take into account customer impacts when establishing such charges. In establishing charges, terms and conditions for delivery services, the Commission shall take into account voltage level differences. A retail customer shall have the option to request to purchase electric service at any delivery service voltage reasonably and technically feasible from the electric facilities serving that customer's premises provided that there are no significant adverse impacts upon system reliability or system efficiency. A retail customer shall also have the option to request to purchase electric service at any point of delivery that is reasonably and technically feasible provided that there are no significant adverse impacts on system reliability or efficiency. Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied.  

(e) Electric utilities shall recover the costs of installing, operating or maintaining facilities for the particular benefit of one or more delivery services customers, including without limitation any costs incurred in complying with a customer's request to be served at a different voltage level, directly from the retail customer or customers for whose benefit the costs were incurred, to the extent such costs are not recovered through the charges referred to in subsections (c) and (d) of this Section.  

(f) An electric utility shall be entitled but not required to implement transition charges in conjunction with the offering of delivery services pursuant to Section 16-104. If an electric utility implements transition charges, it shall implement such charges for all delivery services customers and for all customers described in subsection (h), but shall not implement transition charges for power and energy that a retail customer takes from cogeneration or self-generation facilities located on that retail customer's premises, if such facilities meet the following criteria:  

(i) the cogeneration or self-generation facilities serve a single retail customer and are located on that retail customer's premises (for purposes of this subparagraph and subparagraph (ii), an industrial or manufacturing retail customer and a third party contractor that is served by such industrial or manufacturing customer through such retail customer's own electrical distribution facilities under the circumstances described in subsection (vi) of the definition of "alternative retail electric supplier" set forth in Section 16-102, shall be considered a single retail customer);  

(ii) the cogeneration or self-generation facilities either (A) are sized pursuant to generally accepted engineering standards for the retail customer's electrical load at that premises (taking into account standby or other reliability considerations related to that retail customer's operations at that site) or (B) if the facility is a cogeneration facility located on the retail customer's premises, the retail customer is the thermal host for that facility and the facility has been designed to meet that retail customer's thermal energy requirements resulting in electrical output beyond that retail customer's electrical demand at that premises, comply with the operating and efficiency standards applicable to "qualifying facilities" specified in title 18 Code of Federal Regulations Section 292.205 as in effect on the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1999;  

(iii) the retail customer on whose premises the facilities are located either has an exclusive right to receive, and corresponding obligation to pay for, all of the electrical capacity of the facility, or in the case of a cogeneration facility that has been designed to meet the retail customer's thermal energy requirements at that premises, an identified amount of the electrical capacity of the facility, over a minimum 5-year period; and  

(iv) if the cogeneration facility is sized for the retail customer's thermal load at that premises but exceeds the electrical load, any sales of excess power or energy are made only at wholesale, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and are not for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this subsection (f).  

If a generation facility located at a retail customer's premises does not meet the above criteria, an electric utility implementing transition charges shall implement a transition charge until December 31, 2006 for any power and energy taken by such retail customer from such facility as if such power and energy had been delivered by the electric utility. Provided, however, that an industrial retail customer that is taking power from a generation facility that does not meet the above criteria but that is located on such customer's premises will not be subject to a transition charge for the power and energy taken by such retail customer from such generation facility if the facility does not serve any other retail customer and either was installed on behalf of the customer and for its own use prior to January 1, 1997, or is both predominantly fueled by byproducts of such customer's manufacturing process at such premises and sells or offers an average of 300 megawatts or more of electricity produced from such generation facility into the wholesale market. Such charges shall be calculated as provided in Section 16-102, and shall be collected on each kilowatt-hour delivered under a delivery services tariff to a  

SB2408 Enrolled  

retail customer from the date the customer first takes delivery services until December 31, 2006 except as provided in subsection (h) of this Section. Provided, however, that an electric utility, other than an electric utility providing service to at least 1,000,000 customers in this State on January 1, 1999, shall be entitled to petition for entry of an order by the Commission authorizing the electric utility to implement transition charges for an additional period ending no later than December 31, 2008. The electric utility shall file its petition with supporting evidence no earlier than 16 months, and no later than 12 months, prior to December 31, 2006. The Commission shall hold a hearing on the electric utility's petition and shall enter its order no later than 8 months after the petition is filed. The Commission shall determine whether and to what extent the electric utility shall be authorized to implement transition charges for an additional period. The Commission may authorize the electric utility to implement transition charges for some or all of the additional period, and shall determine the mitigation factors to be used in implementing such transition charges; provided, that the Commission shall not authorize mitigation factors less than 110% of those in effect during the 12 months ended December 31, 2006. In making its determination, the Commission shall consider the following factors: the necessity to implement transition charges for an additional period in order to maintain the financial integrity of the electric utility;  

the prudence of the electric utility's actions in reducing its costs since the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1997; the ability of the electric utility to provide safe, adequate and reliable service to retail customers in its service area; and the impact on competition of allowing the electric utility to implement transition charges for the additional period.  

(g) The electric utility shall file tariffs that establish the transition charges to be paid by each class of customers to the electric utility in conjunction with the provision of delivery services. The electric utility's tariffs shall define the classes of its customers for purposes of calculating transition charges. The electric utility's tariffs shall provide for the calculation of transition charges on a customer-specific basis for any retail customer whose average monthly maximum electrical demand on the electric utility's system during the 6 months with the customer's highest monthly maximum electrical demands equals or exceeds 3.0 megawatts for electric utilities having more than 1,000,000 customers, and for other electric utilities for any customer that has an average monthly maximum electrical demand on the electric utility's system of one megawatt or more, and (A) for which there exists data on the customer's usage during the 3 years preceding the date that the customer became eligible to take delivery services, or (B) for which there does not exist data on the customer's usage during the 3 years preceding the date that the customer became eligible to take delivery services, if in the electric utility's reasonable judgment there exists comparable usage information or a sufficient basis to develop such information, and further provided that the electric utility can require customers for which an individual calculation is made to sign contracts that set forth the transition charges to be paid by the customer to the electric utility pursuant to the tariff.  

(h) An electric utility shall also be entitled to file tariffs that allow it to collect transition charges from retail customers in the electric utility's service area that do not take delivery services but that take electric power or energy from an alternative retail electric supplier or from an electric utility other than the electric utility in whose service area the customer is located. Such charges shall be calculated, in accordance with the definition of transition charges in Section 16-102, for the period of time that the customer would be obligated to pay transition charges if it were taking delivery services, except that no deduction for delivery services revenues shall be made in such calculation, and usage data from the customer's class shall be used where historical usage data is not available for the individual customer. The customer shall be obligated to pay such charges on a lump sum basis on or before the date on which the customer commences to take service from the alternative retail electric supplier or other electric utility, provided, that the electric utility in whose service area the customer is located shall offer the customer the option of signing a contract pursuant to which the customer pays such charges ratably over the period in which the charges would otherwise have applied.  

(i) An electric utility shall be entitled to add to the bills of delivery services customers charges pursuant to Sections 9-221, 9-222 (except as provided in Section 9-222.1), and Section 16-114 of this Act, Section 5-5 of the Electricity Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Law, Section 6-5 of the Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Coal Resources Development Law of 1997, and Section 13 of the Energy Assistance Act.  

(i-5) An electric utility required to impose the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative Charge provided for in subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act shall add such charge to the bills of its delivery services customers pursuant to the terms of a tariff conforming to the requirements of subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act and this subsection (i-5) and filed with and approved by the Commission. The electric utility shall file its proposed tariff with the Commission on or before July 1, 2022 to be effective, after review and approval or modification by the Commission, beginning January 1, 2023. On or before December 1, 2022, the Commission shall review the electric utility's proposed tariff, including by conducting a docketed proceeding if deemed necessary by the Commission, and shall approve the proposed tariff or direct the electric utility to make modifications the Commission finds necessary for the tariff to conform to the requirements of subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act and this subsection (i-5). The electric utility's tariff shall provide for imposition of the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative Charge on a per-kilowatthour basis to all kilowatthours delivered by the electric utility to its delivery services customers. The tariff shall provide for the calculation of the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative Charge to be in effect for the year beginning January 1, 2023 and each year beginning January 1 thereafter, sufficient to collect the electric utility's estimated payment obligations for the delivery year beginning the following June 1 under contracts for purchase of renewable energy credits entered into pursuant to subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act and the obligations of the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, or any successor department or agency, which for purposes of this subsection (i-5) shall be referred to as the Department, to make grant payments during such delivery year from the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative Fund pursuant to grant contracts entered into pursuant to subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, and using the electric utility's kilowatthour deliveries to its delivery services customers during the delivery year ended May 31 of the preceding calendar year. On or before November 1 of each year beginning November 1, 2022, the Department shall notify the electric utilities of the amount of the Department's estimated obligations for grant payments during the delivery year beginning the following June 1 pursuant to grant contracts entered into pursuant to subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act; and each electric utility shall incorporate in the calculation of its Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative Charge the fractional portion of the Department's estimated obligations equal to the electric utility's kilowatthour deliveries to its delivery services customers in the delivery year ended the preceding May 31 divided by the aggregate deliveries of both electric utilities to delivery services customers in such delivery year. The electric utility shall remit on a monthly basis to the State Treasurer, for deposit in the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative Fund provided for in subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, the electric utility's collections of the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative Charge estimated to be needed by the Department for grant payments pursuant to grant contracts entered into pursuant to subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act. The initial charge under the electric utility's tariff shall be effective for kilowatthours delivered beginning January 1, 2023, and thereafter shall be revised to be effective January 1, 2024 and each January 1 thereafter, based on the payment obligations for the delivery year beginning the following June 1. The tariff shall provide for the electric utility to make an annual filing with the Commission on or before November 15 of each year, beginning in 2023, setting forth the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative Charge to be in effect for the year beginning the following January 1. The electric utility's tariff shall also provide that the electric utility shall make a filing with the Commission on or before August 1 of each year beginning in 2024 setting forth a reconciliation, for the delivery year ended the preceding May 31, of the electric utility's collections of the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative Charge against actual payments for renewable energy credits pursuant to contracts entered into, and the actual grant payments by the Department pursuant to grant contracts entered into, pursuant to subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act. The tariff shall provide that any excess or shortfall of collections to payments shall be deducted from or added to, on a per-kilowatthour basis, the Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative Charge, over the 6-month period beginning October 1 of that calendar year.  

(j) If a retail customer that obtains electric power and energy from cogeneration or self-generation facilities installed for its own use on or before January 1, 1997, subsequently takes service from an alternative retail electric supplier or an electric utility other than the electric utility in whose service area the customer is located for any portion of the customer's electric power and energy requirements formerly obtained from those facilities (including that amount purchased from the utility in lieu of such generation and not as standby power purchases, under a cogeneration displacement tariff in effect as of the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1997), the transition charges otherwise applicable pursuant to subsections (f), (g), or (h) of this Section shall not be applicable in any year to that portion of the customer's electric power and energy requirements formerly obtained from those facilities, provided, that for purposes of this subsection (j), such portion shall not exceed the average number of kilowatt-hours per year obtained from the cogeneration or self-generation facilities during the 3 years prior to the date on which the customer became eligible for delivery services, except as provided in subsection (f) of Section 16-110.  

(k) The electric utility shall be entitled to recover through tariffed charges all of the costs associated with the purchase of zero emission credits from zero emission facilities to meet the requirements of subsection (d-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act and all of the costs associated with the purchase of carbon mitigation credits from carbon-free energy resources to meet the requirements of subsection (d-10) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act. Such costs shall include the costs of procuring the zero emission credits and carbon mitigation credits from carbon-free energy resources, as well as the reasonable costs that the utility incurs as part of the procurement processes and to implement and comply with plans and processes approved by the Commission under subsections such subsection (d-5) and (d-10). The costs shall be allocated across all retail customers through a single, uniform cents per kilowatt-hour charge applicable to all retail customers, which shall appear as a separate line item on each customer's bill. Beginning June 1, 2017, the electric utility shall be entitled to recover through tariffed charges all of the costs associated with the purchase of renewable energy resources to meet the renewable energy resource standards of subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, under procurement plans as approved in accordance with that Section and Section 16-111.5 of this Act. Such costs shall include the costs of procuring the renewable energy resources, as well as the reasonable costs that the utility incurs as part of the procurement processes and to implement and comply with plans and processes approved by the Commission under such Sections. The costs associated with the purchase of renewable energy resources shall be allocated across all retail customers in proportion to the amount of renewable energy resources the utility procures for such customers through a single, uniform cents per kilowatt-hour charge applicable to such retail customers, which shall appear as a separate line item on each such customer's bill. The credits, costs, and penalties associated with the self-direct renewable portfolio standard compliance program described in subparagraph (R) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act shall be allocated to approved eligible self-direct customers by the utility in a cents per kilowatt-hour credit, cost, or penalty, which shall appear as a separate line item on each such customer's bill.  

Notwithstanding whether the Commission has approved the initial long-term renewable resources procurement plan as of June 1, 2017, an electric utility shall place new tariffed charges into effect beginning with the June 2017 monthly billing period, to the extent practicable, to begin recovering the costs of procuring renewable energy resources, as those charges are calculated under the limitations described in subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act. Notwithstanding the date on which the utility places such new tariffed charges into effect, the utility shall be permitted to collect the charges under such tariff as if the tariff had been in effect beginning with the first day of the June 2017 monthly billing period. For the delivery years commencing June 1, 2017, June 1, 2018, and June 1, 2019, and each delivery year thereafter, the electric utility shall deposit into a separate interest bearing account of a financial institution the monies collected under the tariffed charges. Money collected from customers for the procurement of renewable energy resources in a given delivery year may be spent by the utility for the procurement of renewable resources over any of the following 5 delivery years, after which unspent money shall be credited back to retail customers. The electric utility shall spend all money collected in earlier delivery years that has not yet been returned to customers, first, before spending money collected in later delivery years. Any interest earned shall be credited back to retail customers under the reconciliation proceeding provided for in this subsection (k), provided that the electric utility shall first be reimbursed from the interest for the administrative costs that it incurs to administer and manage the account. Any taxes due on the funds in the account, or interest earned on it, will be paid from the account or, if insufficient monies are available in the account, from the monies collected under the tariffed charges to recover the costs of procuring renewable energy resources. Monies deposited in the account shall be subject to the review, reconciliation, and true-up process described in this subsection (k) that is applicable to the funds collected and costs incurred for the procurement of renewable energy resources.  

The electric utility shall be entitled to recover all of the costs identified in this subsection (k) through automatic adjustment clause tariffs applicable to all of the utility's retail customers that allow the electric utility to adjust its tariffed charges consistent with this subsection (k). The determination as to whether any excess funds were collected during a given delivery year for the purchase of renewable energy resources, and the crediting of any excess funds back to retail customers, shall not be made until after the close of the delivery year, which will ensure that the maximum amount of funds is available to implement the approved long-term renewable resources procurement plan during a given delivery year. The amount of excess funds eligible to be credited back to retail customers shall be reduced by an amount equal to the payment obligations required by any contracts entered into by an electric utility under contracts described in subsection (b) of Section 1-56 and subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, even if such payments have not yet been made and regardless of the delivery year in which those payment obligations were incurred. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, including in tariffs authorized by this subsection (k) in effect before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, all unspent funds as of May 31, 2021, excluding any funds credited to customers during any utility billing cycle that commences prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, shall remain in the utility account and shall on a first in, first out basis be used toward utility payment obligations under contracts described in subsection (b) of Section 1-56 and subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act. The electric utility's collections under such automatic adjustment clause tariffs to recover the costs of renewable energy resources, and zero emission credits from zero emission facilities, and carbon mitigation credits from carbon-free energy resources shall be subject to separate annual review, reconciliation, and true-up against actual costs by the Commission under a procedure that shall be specified in the electric utility's automatic adjustment clause tariffs and that shall be approved by the Commission in connection with its approval of such tariffs. The procedure shall provide that any difference between the electric utility's collections for zero emission credits and carbon mitigation credits under the automatic adjustment charges for an annual period and the electric utility's actual costs of renewable energy resources and zero emission credits from zero emission facilities and carbon mitigation credits from carbon-free energy resources for that same annual period shall be refunded to or collected from, as applicable, the electric utility's retail customers in subsequent periods.  

Nothing in this subsection (k) is intended to affect, limit, or change the right of the electric utility to recover the costs associated with the procurement of renewable energy resources for periods commencing before, on, or after June 1, 2017, as otherwise provided in the Illinois Power Agency Act.  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Commission shall not conduct an annual review, reconciliation, and true-up associated with renewable energy resources' collections and costs for the delivery years commencing June 1, 2017, June 1, 2018, June 1, 2019, and June 1, 2020, and shall instead conduct a single review, reconciliation, and true-up associated with renewable energy resources' collections and costs for the 4-year period beginning June 1, 2017 and ending May 31, 2021, provided that the review, reconciliation, and true-up shall not be initiated until after August 31, 2021. During the 4-year period, the utility shall be permitted to collect and retain funds under this subsection (k) and to purchase renewable energy resources under an approved long-term renewable resources procurement plan using those funds regardless of the delivery year in which the funds were collected during the 4-year period.  

If the amount of funds collected during the delivery year commencing June 1, 2017, exceeds the costs incurred during that delivery year, then up to half of this excess amount, as calculated on June 1, 2018, may be used to fund the programs under subsection (b) of Section 1-56 of the Illinois Power Agency Act in the same proportion the programs are funded under that subsection (b). However, any amount identified under this subsection (k) to fund programs under subsection (b) of Section 1-56 of the Illinois Power Agency Act shall be reduced if it exceeds the funding shortfall. For purposes of this Section, "funding shortfall" means the difference between \$200,000,000 and the amount appropriated by the General Assembly to the Illinois Power Agency Renewable Energy  

Resources Fund during the period that commences on the effective date of this amendatory act of the 99th General Assembly and ends on August 1, 2018.  

If the amount of funds collected during the delivery year commencing June 1, 2018, exceeds the costs incurred during that delivery year, then up to half of this excess amount, as calculated on June 1, 2019, may be used to fund the programs under subsection (b) of Section 1-56 of the Illinois Power Agency Act in the same proportion the programs are funded under that subsection (b). However, any amount identified under this subsection (k) to fund programs under subsection (b) of Section 1-56 of the Illinois Power Agency Act shall be reduced if it exceeds the funding shortfall.  

If the amount of funds collected during the delivery year commencing June 1, 2019, exceeds the costs incurred during that delivery year, then up to half of this excess amount, as calculated on June 1, 2020, may be used to fund the programs under subsection (b) of Section 1-56 of the Illinois Power Agency Act in the same proportion the programs are funded under that subsection (b). However, any amount identified under this subsection (k) to fund programs under subsection (b) of Section 1-56 of the Illinois Power Agency Act shall be reduced if it exceeds the funding shortfall.  

The funding available under this subsection (k), if any, for the programs described under subsection (b) of Section 1-56 of the Illinois Power Agency Act shall not reduce the amount of funding for the programs described in subparagraph (O) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act. If funding is available under this subsection (k) for programs described under subsection (b) of Section 1-56 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, then the long-term renewable resources plan shall provide for the Agency to procure contracts in an amount that does not exceed the funding, and the contracts approved by the Commission shall be executed by the applicable utility or utilities.  

(l) A utility that has terminated any contract executed under subsection (d-5) or (d-10) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act shall be entitled to recover any remaining balance associated with the purchase of zero emission credits prior to such termination, and such utility shall also apply a credit to its retail customer bills in the event of any over-collection.  

(m)(1) An electric utility that recovers its costs of procuring zero emission credits from zero emission facilities through a cents-per-kilowatthour charge under to subsection (k) of this Section shall be subject to the requirements of this subsection (m). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, such electric utility shall, beginning on April 30, 2018, and each April 30 thereafter until April 30, 2026, calculate whether any reduction must be applied to such cents-per-kilowatthour charge that is paid by retail customers of the electric utility that have opted out of are exempt from  

SB2408 Enrolled  

subsections (a) through (j) of Section 8-103B of this Act under subsection (l) of Section 8-103B. Such charge shall be reduced for such customers for the next delivery year commencing on June 1 based on the amount necessary, if any, to limit the annual estimated average net increase for the prior calendar year due to the future energy investment costs to no more than 1.3% of 5.98 cents per kilowatt-hour, which is the average amount paid per kilowatthour for electric service during the year ending December 31, 2015 by Illinois industrial retail customers, as reported to the Edison Electric Institute.  

The calculations required by this subsection (m) shall be made only once for each year, and no subsequent rate impact determinations shall be made.  

(2) For purposes of this Section, "future energy investment costs" shall be calculated by subtracting the cents-per-kilowatthour charge identified in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (2) from the sum of the cents-per-kilowatthour charges identified in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (2):  

(A) The cents-per-kilowatthour charge identified in the electric utility's tariff placed into effect under Section 8-103 of the Public Utilities Act that, on December 1, 2016, was applicable to those retail customers that have opted out of are exempt from subsections (a) through (j) of Section 8-103B of this Act under subsection  

(l) of Section 8-103B.  

(B) The sum of the following cents-per-kilowatthour charges applicable to those retail customers that have opted out of are exempt from subsections (a) through (j) of Section 8-103B of this Act under subsection (l) of Section 8-103B, provided that if one or more of the following charges has been in effect and applied to such customers for more than one calendar year, then each charge shall be equal to the average of the charges applied over a period that commences with the calendar year ending December 31, 2017 and ends with the most recently completed calendar year prior to the calculation required by this subsection (m):  

(i) the cents-per-kilowatthour charge to recover the costs incurred by the utility under subsection (d-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, adjusted for any reductions required under this subsection (m); and  

(ii) the cents-per-kilowatthour charge to recover the costs incurred by the utility under Section 16-107.6 of the Public Utilities Act.  

If no charge was applied for a given calendar year under item (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph (B), then the value of the charge for that year shall be zero.  

(3) If a reduction is required by the calculation performed under this subsection (m), then the amount of the  

Public Act 102-0662  

SB2408 Enrolled  

LRB102 11366 BMS 16699 b  

reduction shall be multiplied by the number of years reflected in the averages calculated under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2) of this subsection (m). Such reduction shall be applied to the cents-per-kilowatthour charge that is applicable to those retail customers that have opted out of are exempt from subsections (a) through (j) of Section 8-103B of this Act under subsection (l) of Section 8-103B beginning with the next delivery year commencing after the date of the calculation required by this subsection (m).  

(4) The electric utility shall file a notice with the Commission on May 1 of 2018 and each May 1 thereafter until May 1, 2026 containing the reduction, if any, which must be applied for the delivery year which begins in the year of the filing. The notice shall contain the calculations made pursuant to this Section. By October 1 of each year beginning in 2018, each electric utility shall notify the Commission if it appears, based on an estimate of the calculation required in this subsection (m), that a reduction will be required in the next year.

(220 ILCS 5/16-108.18 new)   
Sec. 16-108.18. Performance-based ratemaking.   
(a) The General Assembly finds: (1) That improving the alignment of utility customer   
and company interests is critical to ensuring equity,  

rapid growth of distributed energy resources, electric vehicles, and other new technologies that substantially change the makeup of the grid and protect Illinois residents and businesses from potential economic and environmental harm from the State's energy systems.  

(2) There is urgency around addressing increasing threats from climate change and assisting communities that have borne disproportionate impacts from climate change, including air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy burdens. Addressing this problem requires changes to the business model under which utilities in Illinois have traditionally functioned.  

(3) Providing targeted incentives to support change through a new performance-based structure to enhance ratemaking is intended to enable alignment of utility, customer, community, and environmental goals.  

(4) Though Illinois has taken some measures to move utilities to performance-based ratemaking through the establishment of performance incentives and a performance-based formula rate under the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act, these measures have not been sufficiently transformative in urgently moving electric utilities toward the State's ambitious energy policy goals: protecting a healthy environment and climate, improving public health, and creating quality jobs and economic opportunities, including wealth building, especially in economically disadvantaged communities and communities of color.  

(5) These measures were not developed through a process to understand first what performance measures and penalties would help drive the sought-after behavior by the utilities.  

(6) While the General Assembly has not made a finding that the spending related to the Energy Infrastructure and Modernization Act and its performance metrics was not reasonable, it is important to address concerns that these measures may have resulted in excess utility spending and guaranteed profits without meaningful improvements in customer experience, rate affordability, or equity.  

(7) Discussions of performance incentive mechanisms must always take into account the affordability of customer rates and bills for all customers, including low-income customers.  

(8) The General Assembly therefore directs the Illinois Commerce Commission to complete a transition that includes a comprehensive performance-based regulation framework for electric utilities serving more than 500,000 customers. The breadth of this framework should revise existing utility regulations to position Illinois electric utilities to effectively and efficiently achieve current and anticipated future energy needs of this State, while ensuring affordability for consumers.  

(b) As used in this Section:  

"Commission" means the Illinois Commerce Commission.  

"Demand response" means measures that decrease peak electricity demand or shift demand from peak to off-peak periods.  

"Distributed energy resources" or "DER" means a wide range of technologies that are connected to the grid including those that are located on the customer side of the customer's electric meter and can provide value to the distribution system, including, but not limited to, distributed generation, energy storage, electric vehicles, and demand response technologies.  

"Economically disadvantaged communities" means areas of one or more census tracts where average household income does not exceed 80% of area median income.  

"Environmental justice communities" means the definition of that term as used and as may be updated in the long-term renewable resources procurement plan by the Illinois Power Agency and its Program Administrator in the Illinois Solar for All Program.  

"Equity investment eligible community" means the   
geographic areas throughout Illinois which would most benefit   
from equitable investments by the State designed to combat   
discrimination. Specifically, the equity investment eligible   
communities shall be defined as the following areas: (1) R3 Areas as established pursuant to Section 10-40  

of the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, where residents have historically been excluded from economic opportunities, including opportunities in the energy sector; and  

(2) Environmental justice communities, as defined by the Illinois Power Agency pursuant to the Illinois Power Agency Act, where residents have historically been subject to disproportionate burdens of pollution, including pollution from the energy sector.  

"Performance incentive mechanism" means an instrument by which utility performance is incentivized, which could include a monetary performance incentive.  

"Performance metric" means a manner of measurement for a particular utility activity.  

(c) Through coordinated, comprehensive system planning, ratemaking, and performance incentives, the performance-based ratemaking framework should be designed to accomplish the following objectives:  

(1) maintain and improve service reliability and safety, including and particularly in environmental justice, low-income and equity investment eligible communities;  

(2) decarbonize utility systems at a pace that meets or exceeds State climate goals, while also ensuring the affordability of rates for all customers, including low-income customers;  

(3) direct electric utilities to make cost-effective investments that support achievement of Illinois' clean energy policies, including, at a minimum, investments designed to integrate distributed energy resources, comply with critical infrastructure protection standards, plans, and industry best practices, and support and take advantage of potential benefits from the electric vehicle charging and other electrification, while mitigating the impacts;  

(4) choose cost-effective assets and services, whether   
utility-supplied or through third-party contracting,   
considering both economic and environmental costs and the   
effects on utility rates, to deliver high-quality service   
to customers at least cost; (5) maintain the affordability of electric delivery   
services for all customers, including low-income   
customers; (6) maintain and grow a diverse workforce, diverse   
supplier procurement base and, for relevant programs,   
diverse approved-vendor pools, including increased   
opportunities for minority-owned, female-owned,   
veteran-owned, and disability-owned business enterprises; (7) improve customer service performance and   
engagement; (8) address the particular burdens faced by consumers   
in environmental justice and equity investment eligible  

communities, including shareholder, consumer, and publicly funded bill payment assistance and credit and collection policies, and ensure equitable disconnections, late fees, or arrearages as a result of utility credit and collection practices, which may include consideration of impact by zip code; and  

(9) implement or otherwise enhance current supplier diversity programs to increase diverse contractor participation in professional services, subcontracting, and prime contracting opportunities with programs that address barriers to access. Supplier diversity programs shall address specific barriers related to RFP and contract access, access to capital, information technology and cyber security access and costs, administrative burdens, and quality control with specific metrics, outcomes, and demographic data reported.  

(d) Multi-Year Rate Plan.  

(1) If an electric utility had a performance-based formula rate in effect under Section 16-108.5 as of December 31, 2020, then the utility may file a petition proposing tariffs implementing a 4-year Multi-Year Rate Plan as provided in this Section no later than, January 20, 2023, for delivery service rates to be effective for the billing periods January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2027. The Commission shall issue an order approving or approving as modified the utility's plan no later than  

December 20, 2023. The term "Multi-Year Rate Plan" refers to a plan establishing the base rates the utility shall charge for each delivery year of the 4-year period to be covered by the plan, which shall be subject to modification only as expressly allowed in this Section.  

(2) A utility proposing a Multi-Year Rate Plan shall provide a 4-year investment plan and a description of the utility's major planned investments, including, at a minimum, all investments of \$2,000,000 or greater over the plan period for an electric utility that serves more than 3,000,000 retail customers in the State or \$500,000 for an electric utility that serves less than 3,000,000 retail customers in the State but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State. The 4-year investment plan must be consistent with the Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan described in Section 16-105.17 of this Act. The investment plan shall provide sufficiently detailed information, as required by the Commission, including, at a minimum, a description of each investment, the location of the investment, and an explanation of the need for and benefit of such an investment to the extent known.  

(3) The Multi-Year Rate Plan shall be implemented through a tariff filed with the Commission consistent with the provisions of this paragraph (3) that shall apply to all delivery service customers. The Commission shall initiate and conduct an investigation of the tariff in a manner consistent with the provisions of this paragraph (3) and the provisions of Article IX of this Act, to the extent they do not conflict with this paragraph (3). The Multi-Year Rate Plan approved by the Commission shall do the following:  

(A) Provide for the recovery of the utility's forecasted rate base, based on the 4-year investment plan and the utility's Integrated Grid Plan. The forecasted rate base must include the utility's planned capital investments, with rates based on average annual plant investment, and investment-related costs, including income tax impacts, depreciation, and ratemaking adjustments and costs that are prudently incurred and reasonable in amount consistent with Commission practice and law. The process used to develop the forecasts must be iterative, rigorous, and lead to forecasts that reasonably represent the utility's investments during the forecasted period and ensure that the investments are projected to be used and useful during the annual investment period and least cost, consistent with the provisions of Articles VIII and IX of this Act.  

(B) The cost of equity shall be approved by the Commission consistent with Commission practice and law.  

(C) The revenue requirement shall reflect the utility's actual capital structure for the applicable calendar year. A year-end capital structure that includes a common equity ratio of up to and including 50% of the total capital structure shall be deemed prudent and reasonable. A higher common equity ratio must be specifically approved by the Commission.  

(E) Provide for recovery of prudent and reasonable projected operating expenses, giving effect to ratemaking adjustments, consistent with Commission practice and law under Article IX of this Act. Operating expenses for years after the first year of the Multi-Year Rate Plan may be estimated by the use of known and measurable changes, expense reductions associated with planned capital investments as appropriate, and reasonable and appropriate escalators, indices, or other metrics.  

(F) Amortize the amount of unprotected property-related excess accumulated deferred income taxes in rates as of January 1, 2023 over a period ending December 31, 2027, unless otherwise required to amortize the excess deferred income tax pursuant to Section 16-108.21 of this Act.  

(G) Allow recovery of incentive compensation expense that is based on the achievement of operational metrics, including metrics related to budget controls, outage duration and frequency, safety, customer service, efficiency and productivity, environmental compliance and attainment of affordability and environmental goals, and other goals and metrics approved by the Commission. Incentive compensation expense that is based on net income or an affiliate's earnings per share shall not be recoverable.  

(H) To the maximum extent practicable, align the 4-year investment plan and annual capital budgets with the electric utility's Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan.  

(4) The Commission shall establish annual rates for each year of the Multi-Year Rate Plan that accurately reflect and are based only upon the utility's reasonable and prudent costs of service over the term of the plan, including the effect of all ratemaking adjustments consistent with Commission practice and law as determined by the Commission, provided that the costs are not being recovered elsewhere in rates. Tariff riders authorized by the Commission may continue outside of a plan authorized under this Section to the extent such costs are not recovered elsewhere in rates. For the first multi-year rate plan, the burden of proof shall be on the electric utility to establish the prudence of investments and expenditures and to establish that such investments consistent with and reasonably necessary to meet the requirements of the utility's first approved Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan described in Section 16-105.17 of this Act. For subsequent Multi-Year Rate Plans, the burden of proof shall be on the electric utility to establish the prudence of investments and expenditures and to establish that such investments are consistent with and reasonably necessary to meet the requirements of the utility's most recently approved Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan described in Section 16-105.17 of this Act. The sole fact that a cost differs from that incurred in a prior period or that an investment is different from that described in the Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan shall not imply the imprudence or unreasonableness of that cost or investment. The sole fact that an investment is the same or similar to that described in the Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan shall not imply prudence and reasonableness of that investment.  

(5) To facilitate public transparency, all materials, data, testimony, and schedules shall be provided to the Commission in an editable, machine-readable electronic format including .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, and similar file formats, but not including .pdf or .exif. Should utilities designate any materials confidential, they shall have an affirmative duty to explain why the particular information is marked confidential. In determining prudence and reasonableness of rates, the Commission shall make its determination based upon the record, including each public comment filed or provided orally at open meetings consistent with the Commission's rules and practices.  

(6) The Commission may, by order, establish terms, conditions, and procedures for submitting and approving a Multi-Year Rate Plan necessary to implement this Section and ensure that rates remain just and reasonable during the course of the plan, including terms and procedures for rate adjustment.  

(7) An electric utility that files a tariff pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection (e) must submit a one-time \$300,000 filing fee at the time the Chief Clerk of the Commission accepts the filing, which shall be a recoverable expense.  

(8) An electric utility operating under a Multi-Year Rate Plan shall file a new Multi-Year Rate Plan at least 300 days prior to the end of the initial Multi-Year Rate Plan unless it elects to file a general rate case pursuant to paragraph (9), and every 4 years thereafter, with a rate-effective date of the proposed tariffs such that, after the Commission suspension period, the rates would take effect immediately at the close of the final year of the initial Multi-Year Rate Plan. In subsequent Multi-Year Rate Plans, as in the initial plans, utilities and stakeholders may propose additional metrics that achieve the outcomes described in paragraph (2) of subsection (f) of this Section.  

(9) Election of Rate Case.  

(A) On or before the date prescribed by subparagraph (B) of paragraph (9) of this Section, electric utilities that serve more than 500,000 retail customers in the State shall file either a general rate case under Section 9-201 of this Act, or a Multi-Year Rate Plan, as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection (d).  

(B) Electric utilities described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (9) of this Section shall file their initial general rate case or Multi-Year Rate Plan, as applicable, with the Commission no later than January 20, 2023.  

(C) Notwithstanding which rate filing option an electric utility elects to file on the date prescribed by subparagraph (B) of paragraph (9) of this Section, the electric utility shall be subject to the Multi-year Integrated Plan filing requirements.  

(D) Following its initial rate filing pursuant to paragraph (2), an electric utility subject to the requirements of this Section shall thereafter be permitted to elect a different rate filing option consistent with any filing intervals established for a general rate case or Multi-Year Rate Plan, as follows:  

(i) An electric utility that initially elected to file a Multi-Year Rate Plan and thereafter elects to transition to a general rate case may do so upon completion of the 4-year Multi-Year Rate Plan by filing a general rate case at the same time that the utility would have filed its subsequent Multi-Year Rate Plan, as specified in paragraph (8) of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding this election, the annual adjustment of the final year of the Multi-Year Rate Plan shall proceed as specified in paragraph (6) of subsection (f). (ii) An electric utility that initially elected to a file general rate case and thereafter elects to transition to a Multi-Year Rate Plan may do so only at the 4-year filing intervals identified by paragraph (8) of this subsection (d).  

(10) The Commission shall approve tariffs establishing rate design for all delivery service customers unless the electric utility makes the election specified in Section 16-105.5, in which case the rate design shall be subject to the provisions of that Section.  

(11) The Commission shall establish requirements for annual performance evaluation reports to be submitted annually for performance metrics. Such reports shall include, but not be limited to, a description of the utility's performance under each metric and an identification of any extraordinary events that adversely affected the utility's performance.  

(12) For the first Multi-Year Rate Plan, the Commission shall consolidate its investigation with the proceeding under Section 16-105.17 to establish the Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan no later than 45 days after plan filing.  

(13) Where a rate change under a Multi-Year Rate Plan will result in a rate increase, an electric utility may propose a rate phase-in plan that the Commission shall approve with or without modification or deny in its final order approving the new delivery services rates. A proposed rate phase-in plan under this paragraph (13) must allow the new delivery services rates to be implemented in no more than 2 steps, as follows: in the first step, at least 50% of the approved rate increase must be reflected in rates, and, in the second step, 100% of the rate increase must be reflected in rates. The second step's rates must take effect no later than 12 months after the first step's rates were placed into effect. The portion of the approved rate increase not implemented in the first step shall be recorded on the electric utility's books as a regulatory asset, and shall accrue carrying costs to ensure that the utility does not recover more or less than it otherwise would because of the deferral. This portion shall be recovered, with such carrying costs at the weighted average cost of capital, through a surcharge applied to retail customer bills that (i) begins no later than 12 months after the date on which the second step's rates went into effect and (ii) is applied over a period not to exceed 24 months. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit the Commission's authority to mitigate the impact of rates caused by rate plans, or any other instance on a revenue-neutral basis; nor shall it mitigate a utility's ability to make proposals to mitigate the impact of rates. When a deferral, or similar method, is used to mitigate the impact of rates, the utility should be allowed to recover carrying costs.  

(14) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section (13), the Commission may, on its own initiative, take revenue-neutral measures to relieve the impact of rate increases on customers. Such initiatives may be taken by the Commission in the first Multi-Year Rate Plan, subsequent multi-year plans, or in other instances described in this Act.  

(15) Whenever during the pendency of a Multi-year Rate Plan, an electric utility subject to this Section becomes aware that, due to circumstances beyond its control, prudent operating practices will require the utility to make adjustments to the Multi-Year Rate Plan, the electric utility may file a petition with the Commission requesting modification of the approved annual revenue requirements included in the Multi-Year Rate Plan. The electric utility must support its request with evidence demonstrating why a modification is necessary, due to circumstances beyond the utility's control, to follow prudent operating practices and must set forth the changes to each annual revenue requirement to be approved, and the basis for any changes in anticipated operating expenses or capital investment levels. The utility shall affirmatively address the impact of the changes on the Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan and Multi-Year Rate Plan originally submitted and approved by the Commission. Any interested party may file an objection to the changes proposed, or offer alternatives to the utility's proposal, as supported by testimony and evidence. After notice and hearing, the Commission shall issue a final order regarding the electric utility's request no later than 180 days after the filing of the petition.  

(e) Performance incentive mechanisms.  

(1) The electric industry is undergoing rapid transformation, including fundamental changes in how electricity is generated, procured, and delivered and how customers are choosing to participate in the supply and delivery of electricity to and from the electric grid. Building upon the State's goals to increase the procurement of electricity from renewable energy resources, including distributed generation and storage devices, the General Assembly finds that electric utilities should make cost-effective investments that support moving forward on Illinois' clean energy policies. It is therefore in the State's interest for the Commission to establish performance incentive mechanisms in order to better tie utility revenues to performance and customer benefits, accelerate progress on Illinois energy and other goals, ensure equity and affordability of rates for all customers, including low-income customers, and hold utilities publicly accountable.  

(2) The Commission shall approve, based on the substantial evidence proffered in the proceeding initiated pursuant to this subsection performance metrics that, to the extent practicable and achievable by the electric utility, encourage cost-effective, equitable utility achievement of the outcomes described in this subsection (e) while ensuring no degradation in the significant performance improvement achieved through previously established performance metrics. For each electric utility, the Commission shall approve metrics designed to achieve incremental improvements over baseline performance values and targets, over a performance period of up to 10 years, and no less than 4 years.  

(A) The Commission shall approve no more than 8 metrics, with at least one metric from each of the categories below, for each electric utility, from subparagraphs (i) through (vi) of this subsection (A). Upon a utility request, the Commission may approve the use of a specific, measurable, and achievable tracking metric described in paragraph (3) of subsection (e) as a performance metric pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection (e).  

(i) Metrics designed to ensure the utility maintains and improves the high standards of both overall and locational reliability and resiliency, and makes improvements in power quality, including and particularly in environmental justice and equity investment eligible communities.   
(ii) Peak load reductions attributable to demand response programs.   
(iii) Supplier diversity expansion, including diverse contractor participation in professional services, subcontracting, and prime contracting opportunities, development of programs that address the barriers to access, aligning demographics of contractors to the demographics in the utility's service territory, establish long-term mentoring relationships that develop and remove barriers to access for diverse and underserved contractors. The utilities shall provide solutions, resources, and tools to address  

complex barriers of entry related to costly and time-intensive cyber security requirements, increasingly complex information technology requirements, insurance barriers, service provider sign-up process barriers, administrative process barriers, and other barriers that inhibit access to RFPs and contracts. For programs with contracts over \$1,000,000, winning bidders must demonstrate a subcontractor development or mentoring relationship with at least one of their diverse subcontracting partners for a core component of the scope of the project. The mentoring time and cost shall be taken into account in the creation of RFP and shall include a structured and measured plan by the prime contractor to increase the capabilities of the subcontractor in their proposed scope. The metric shall include reporting on all supplier diversity programs by goals, program results, demographics and geography, with separate reporting by category of minority-owned, female-owned, veteran-owned, and disability-owned business enterprise metrics. The report shall include resources and expenses committed to the programs and conversion rates of new diverse utility contractors. (iv) Achieve affordable customer delivery service costs, with particular emphasis on keeping the bills of lower-income households, households in equity investment eligible communities, and household in environmental justice communities within a manageable portion of their income and adopting credit and collection policies that reduce disconnections for these households specifically and for customers overall to ensure equitable disconnections, late fees, or arrearages as a result of utility credit and collection practices, which may include consideration of impact by zip code.  

(v) Metrics designed around the utility's timeliness to customer requests for interconnection in key milestone areas, such as: initial response, supplemental review, and system feasibility study; improved average service reliability index for those customers that have interconnected a distributed renewable energy generation device to the utility's distribution system and are lawfully taking service under an applicable tariff; offering a variety of affordable rate options, including demand response, time of use rates for delivery and supply, real-time pricing rates for supply; comprehensive and predictable net metering, and maximizing the benefits of grid modernization and clean energy for ratepayers; and improving customer access to utility system information according to consumer demand and interest.  

(vi) Metrics designed to measure the utility's customer service performance, which may include the average length of time to answer a customer's call by a customer service representative, the abandoned call rate and the relative ranking of the electric utility, by a reputable third-party organization, in customer service satisfaction when compared to other similar electric utilities in the Midwest region.  

(B) Performance metrics shall include a description of the metric, a calculation method, a data collection method, annual performance targets, and any incentives or penalties for the utility's achievement of, or failure to achieve, their performance targets, provided that the total amount of potential incentives and penalties shall be symmetrical. I ncentives shall be rewards or penalties or both, reflected as basis points added to, or subtracted from, the utility's cost of equity. The metrics and incentives shall apply for the entire time period covered by a Multi-Year Rate Plan. The total for all metrics shall be equal to 40 basis points, however, the Commission may adjust the basis points upward or downward by up to 20 basis points for any given Multi-Year Rate Plan, as appropriate, but in no event may the total exceed 60 basis points or fall below 20 basis points.  

(C) Metrics related to reliability shall be implemented to ensure equitable benefits to environmental justice and equity investment eligible communities, as defined in this Act.  

(D) The Commission shall approve performance metrics that are reasonably within control of the utility to achieve. The Commission also shall not approve a metric that is solely expected to have the effect of reducing the workforce. Performance metrics should measure outcomes and actual, rather than projected, results where possible. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to require that different electric utilities must be subject to the same metrics, goals, or incentives.  

(E) Increases or enhancements to an existing performance goal or target shall be considered in light of other metrics, cost-effectiveness, and other factors the Commission deems appropriate. Performance metrics shall include one year of tracking data collected in a consistent manner, verifiable by an independent evaluator in order to establish a baseline and measure outcomes and actual results against projections where possible.  

(F) For the purpose of determining reasonable performance metrics and related incentives, the Commission shall develop a methodology to calculate net benefits that includes customer and societal costs and benefits and quantifies the effect on delivery rates. In determining the appropriate level of a performance incentive, the Commission shall consider: the extent to which the amount is likely to encourage the utility to achieve the performance target in the least cost manner; the value of benefits to customers, the grid, public health and safety, and the environment from achievement of the performance target, including in particular benefits to equity investment eligible community; the affordability of customer's electric bills, including low-income customers, the utility's revenue requirement, the promotion of renewable and distributed energy, and other such factors that the Commission deems appropriate. The consideration of these factors shall result in an incentive level that ensures benefits exceed costs for customers.   
(G) Achievement of performance metrics are based  

on the assumptions that the utility will adopt or implement the technology and equipment, and make the investments to the extent reasonably necessary to achieve the goal. If the electric utility is unable to meet the performance metrics as a result of extraordinary circumstances outside of its control, including but not limited to government-declared emergencies, then the utility shall be permitted to file a petition with the Commission requesting that the utility be excused from compliance with the applicable performance goal or goals and the associated financial incentives and penalties. The burden of proof shall be on the utility, consistent with Article IX, and the utility's petition shall be supported by substantial evidence. The Commission shall, after notice and hearing, enter its order approving or denying, in whole or in part, the utility's petition based on the extent to which the utility demonstrated that its achievement of the affected metrics and performance goals was hindered by extraordinary circumstances outside of the utility's control.  

(3) The Commission shall approve reasonable and appropriate tracking metrics to collect and monitor data for the purpose of measuring and reporting utility performance and for establishing future performance metrics. These additional tracking metrics shall include at least one metric from each of the following categories  

# of performance:  

(A) Minimize emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants that harm human health, particularly in environmental justice and equity investment eligible communities, through minimizing total emissions by accelerating electrification of transportation, buildings and industries where such electrification results in net reductions, across all fuels and over the life of electrification measures, of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, taking into consideration the fuel mix used to produce electricity at the relevant hour and the effect of accelerating electrification on electricity delivery services rates, supply prices and peak demand, provided the revenues the utility receives from accelerating electrification of transportation, buildings and industries exceed the costs.  

(B) Enhance the grid's flexibility to adapt to   
increased deployment of nondispatchable resources,   
improve the ability and performance of the grid on   
load balancing, and offer a variety of rate plans to   
match consumer consumption patterns and lower consumer   
bills for electricity delivery and supply. (C) Ensure rates reflect cost savings attributable   
to grid modernization and utilize distributed energy   
resources that allow the utility to defer or forgo  

traditional grid investments that would otherwise be required to provide safe and reliable service.  

(D) Metrics designed to create and sustain full-time-equivalent jobs and opportunities for all segments of the population and workforce, including minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and businesses owned by a person or persons with a disability, and that do not, consistent with State and federal law, discriminate based on race or socioeconomic status as a result of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly.  

(E) Maximize and prioritize the allocation of grid planning benefits to environmental justice and economically disadvantaged customers and communities, such that all metrics provide equitable benefits across the utility's service territory and maintain and improve utility customers' access to uninterrupted utility services.  

(4) The Commission may establish new tracking and   
performance metrics in future Multi-Year Rate Plans to   
further measure achievement of the outcomes set forth in   
paragraph (2) of subsection (f) of this Section and the   
other goals and requirements of this Section. (5) The Commission shall also evaluate metrics that   
were established in prior Multi-Year Rate Plans to   
determine if there has been an unanticipated material  

change in circumstances such that adjustments are required to improve the likelihood of the outcomes described in paragraph (2) of subsection (f). For metrics that were established in prior Multi-Year Rate Plan proceedings and that the Commission elects to continue, the design of these metrics, including the goals of tracking metrics and the targets and incentive levels and structures of performance metrics, may be adjusted pursuant to the requirements in this Section. The Commission may also change, adjust or phase out tracking and performance metrics that were established in prior Multi-Year Rate Plan proceedings if these metrics no longer meet the requirements of this Section or if they are rendered obsolete by the changing needs and technology of an evolving grid. Additionally, performance metrics that no longer require an incentive to create improved utility performance may become tracking metrics in a Multi-Year Rate Plan proceeding.  

(6) The Commission shall initiate a workshop process no later than August 1, 2021, or 15 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, whichever is later, for the purpose of facilitating the development of metrics for each utility. The workshop shall be coordinated by the staff of the Commission, or a facilitator retained by staff, and shall be organized and facilitated in a manner that encourages representation from diverse stakeholders and ensures equitable opportunities for participation, without requiring formal intervention or representation by an attorney. Working with staff of the Commission the facilitator may conduct a combination of workshops specific to a utility or applicable to multiple utilities where content and stakeholders are substantially similar. The workshop process shall conclude no later than October 31, 2021. Following the workshop, the staff of the Commission, or the facilitator retained by the Staff, shall prepare and submit a report to the Commission that identifies the participants in the process, the metrics proposed during the process, any material issues that remained unresolved at the conclusions of such process, and any recommendations for workshop process improvements. Any workshop participant may file comments and reply comments in response to the Staff report.  

(A) No later than January, 20, 2022, each electric utility that intends to file a petition pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section shall file a petition with the Commission seeking approval of its performance metrics, which shall include for each metric, at a minimum, (i) a detailed description, (ii) the calculation of the baseline, (iii) the performance period and overall performance goal, provided that the performance period shall not commence prior to January  

1, 2024, (iv) each annual performance goal, (v) the performance adjustment, which shall be a symmetrical basis point increase or decrease to the utility's cost of equity based on the extent to which the utility achieved the annual performance goal, and (vi) the new or modified tariff mechanism that will apply the performance adjustments. The Commission shall issue its order approving, or approving with modification, the utility's proposed performance metrics no later than September 30, 2022.  

(B) No later than August 1, 2025, the Commission shall initiate a workshop process that conforms to the workshop purpose and requirements of this paragraph (6) of this Section to the extent they do not conflict. The workshop process shall conclude no later than October 31, 2025, and the staff of the Commission, or the facilitator retained by the Staff, shall prepare and submit a report consistent with the requirements described in this paragraph (6) of this Section. No later than January 20, 2026, each electric utility subject to the requirements of this Section shall file a petition the reflects, and is consistent with, the components required in this paragraph (6) of this Section, and the Commission shall issue its order approving, or approving with modification, the utility's proposed performance metrics no later than  

September 30, 2026.  

(f) On May 1 of each year, following the approval of the first Multi-Year Rate Plan and its initial year, the Commission shall open an annual performance evaluation proceeding to evaluate the utilities' performance on their metric targets during the year just completed, as well as the appropriate Annual Adjustment as defined in paragraph (6). The Commission shall determine the performance and annual adjustments to be applied through a surcharge in the following calendar year.  

(1) On February 15 of each year, prior to the annual performance evaluation proceeding, each utility shall file a performance evaluation report with the Commission that includes a description of and all data supporting how the utility performed under each performance metric and an identification of any extraordinary events that adversely impacted the utility's performance.  

(2) The metrics approved under this Section are based on the assumptions that the utility may fully implement the technology and equipment, and make the investments, required to achieve the metrics and performance goals. If the utility is unable to meet the metrics and performance goals because it was hindered by unanticipated technology or equipment implementation delays, government-declared emergencies, or other investment impediments, then the utility shall be permitted to file a petition with the  

Commission on or before the date that its report is due pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection (f) requesting that the utility be excused from compliance with the applicable performance goal or goals. The burden of proof shall be on the utility, consistent with Article IX, and the utility's petition shall be supported by substantial evidence. No later than 90 days after the utility files its petition, the Commission shall, after notice and hearing, enter its order approving or denying, in whole or in part, the utility's petition based on the extent to which the utility demonstrated that its achievement of the affected metrics and performance goals was hindered by unanticipated technology or equipment implementation delays, or other investment impediments, that were reasonably outside of the utility's control.  

(3) The electric utility shall provide for an annual independent evaluation of its performance on metrics. The independent evaluator shall review the utility's assumptions, baselines, targets, calculation methodologies, and other relevant information, especially ensuring that the utility's data for establishing baselines matches actual performance, and shall provide a report to the Commission in each annual performance evaluation describing the results. The independent evaluator shall present this report as evidence as a nonparty participant and shall not be represented by the utility's legal counsel. The independent evaluator shall be hired through a competitive bidding process with approval of the contract by the Commission.  

The Commission shall consider the report of the independent evaluator in determining the utility's achievement of performance targets. Discrepancies between the utility's assumptions, baselines, targets, or calculations and those of the independent evaluator shall be closely scrutinized by the Commission. If the Commission finds that the utility's reported data for any metric or metrics significantly and incorrectly deviates from the data reported by the independent evaluator, then the Commission shall order the utility to revise its data collection and calculation process within 60 days, with specifications where appropriate.  

(4) The Commission shall, after notice and hearing in the annual performance evaluation proceeding, enter an order approving the utility's performance adjustment based on its achievement of or failure to achieve its performance targets no later than December 20 each year. The Commission-approved penalties or incentives shall be applied beginning with the next calendar year.  

(5) In order to promote the transparency of utility investments during the effective period of a multi-year rate plan, inform the Commission's investigation and adjustment of rates in the annual adjustment process, and to facilitate the participation of stakeholders in the annual adjustment process, an electric utility with an effective Multi-Year Rate Plan shall, within 90 days of the close of each quarter during the Multi-Year Rate Plan period, submit to the Commission a report that summarizes the additions to utility plant that were placed into service during the prior quarter, which for purposes of the report shall be the most recently closed fiscal quarter. The report shall also summarize the utility plant the electric utility projects it will place into service through the end of the calendar year in which the report is filed. The projections, estimates, plans, and forward-looking information that are provided in the reports pursuant to this paragraph (5) are for planning purposes and are intended to be illustrative of the investments that the utility proposes to make as of the time of submittal. Nothing in this paragraph (5) precludes, or is intended to limit, a utility's ability to modify and update its projections, estimates, plans, and forward-looking information previously submitted in order to reflect stakeholder input or other new or updated information and analysis, including, but not limited to, changes in specific investment needs, customer electric use patterns, customer applications and preferences, and commercially available equipment and technologies, however the utility shall explain any changes or deviations between the projected investments from the quarterly reports and actual investments in the annual report. The reports submitted pursuant to this subsection are intended to be flexible planning tools, and are expected to evolve as new information becomes available. Within 7 days of receiving a quarterly report, the Commission shall timely make such report available to the public by posting it on the Commission's website. Each quarterly report shall include the following detail:  

(A) The total dollar value of the additions to utility plant placed in service during the prior quarter;  

(B) A list of the major investment categories the electric utility used to manage its routine standing operational activities during the prior quarter including the total dollar amount for the work reflected in each investment category in which utility plant in service is equal to or greater than \$2,000,000 for an electric utility that serves more than 3,000,000 customers in the State or \$500,000 for an electric utility that serves less than 3,000,000 customers but more than 500,000 customers in the State as of the last day of the quarterly reporting period, as well as a summary description of each investment category;  

(C) A list of the projects which the electric utility has identified by a unique investment tracking number for utility plant placed in service during the prior quarter for utility plant placed in service with a total dollar value as of the last day of the quarterly reporting period that is equal to or greater than \$2,000,000 for an electric utility that serves more than 3,000,000 customers in the State or \$500,000 for an electric utility that serves less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than \$500,000 retail customers in the State, as well as a summary of each project;  

(D) The estimated total dollar value of the additions to utility plant projected to be placed in service through the end of the calendar year in which the report is filed;  

(E) A list of the major investment categories the electric utility used to manage its routine standing operational activities with utility plant projected to be placed in service through the end of the calendar year in which the report is filed, including the total dollar amount for the work reflected in each investment category in which utility plant in service is projected to be equal to or greater than \$2,000,000 for an electric utility that serves more than 3,000,000 customers in the State or \$500,000 for an electric utility that serves less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State, as well as a summary description of each investment category; and  

(F) A list of the projects for which the electric utility has identified by a unique investment tracking number for utility plant projected to be placed in service through the end of the calendar year in which the report is filed with an estimated dollar value that is equal to or greater than \$2,000,000 for an electric utility that serves more than 3,000,000 customers in the State or \$500,000 for an electric utility that serves less than 3,000,000 retails customers but more than \$500,000 retail customers in the State, as well as a summary description of each project.  

(6) As part of the Annual Performance Adjustment, the electric utility shall submit evidence sufficient to support a determination of its actual revenue requirement for the applicable calendar year, consistent with the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (f) of this subsection. The electric utility shall bear the burden of demonstrating that its costs were prudent and reasonable, subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection (f). The Commission's review of the electric utility's annual adjustment shall be based on the same evidentiary standards, including, but not limited to, those concerning the prudence and reasonableness of the known and measurable costs forecasted to be incurred by the utility, and the used and usefulness of the actual plant investment pursuant to Section 9-211 of this Act, that the Commission applies in a proceeding to review a filing for changes in rates pursuant to Section 9-201 of this Act. The Commission shall determine the prudence and reasonableness of the actual costs incurred by the utility during the applicable calendar year, as well as determine the original cost of plant in service as of the end of the applicable calendar year. The Commission shall then determine the Annual Adjustment, which shall mean the amount by which, the electric utility's actual revenue requirement for the applicable year of the Multi-Year Rate Plan either exceeded, or was exceeded by, the revenue requirement approved by the Commission for such calendar year, plus carrying costs calculated at the weighted average cost of capital approved for the Multi-Year Rate Plan.  

The Commission's determination of the electric   
utility's actual revenue requirement for the applicable   
calendar year shall be based on: (A) the Commission-approved used and useful, prudent and reasonable actual costs for the applicable calendar year, which shall be determined pursuant to the following criteria:  

(i) The overall level of actual costs incurred during the calendar year, provided that the Commission may not allow recovery of actual costs that are more than 105% of the approved revenue requirement calculated as provided in item (ii) of this subparagraph (A), except to the extent the Commission approves a modification of the Multi-Year Rate Plan to permit such recovery.  

(ii) The calculation of 105% of the revenue requirement required by this subparagraph (A) shall exclude the revenue requirement impacts of the following volatile and fluctuating variables that occurred during the year: (i) storms and weather-related events for which the utility provides sufficient evidence to demonstrate that such expenses were not foreseeable and not in control of the utility; (ii) new business; (iii) changes in interest rates; (iv) changes in taxes; (v) facility relocations; (vi) changes in pension or post-retirement benefits costs due to fluctuations in interest rates, market returns or actuarial assumptions; (vii) amortization expenses related to costs; and (viii) changes in the timing of when an expenditure or investment is made such that it is accelerated to occur during the applicable year or deferred to occur in a  

subsequent year.  

(B) the year-end rate base;  

(C) the cost of equity approved in the multi-year rate plan; and  

(D) the electric utility's actual year-end capital structure, provided that the common equity ratio in such capital structure may not exceed the common equity ratio that was approved by the Commission in the Multi-Year Rate Plan.  

(2) The Commission's determinations of the prudence and reasonableness of the costs incurred for the applicable year, and of the original cost of plant in service as of the end of the applicable calendar year, shall be final upon entry of the Commission's order and shall not be subject to collateral attack in any other Commission proceeding, case, docket, order, rule, or regulation; however, nothing in this Section shall prohibit a party from petitioning the Commission to rehear or appeal to the courts the order pursuant to the provisions of this Act.  

(g) During the period leading to approval of the first Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan, each electric utility will necessarily continue to invest in its distribution grid. Those investments will be subject to a determination of prudence and reasonableness consistent with Commission practice and law. Any failure to conform to the Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan ultimately approved shall not imply imprudence or unreasonableness.  

(h) After calculating the Performance Adjustment and Annual Adjustment, the Commission shall order the electric utility to collect the amount in excess of the revenue requirement from customers, or issue a refund to customers, as applicable, to be applied through a surcharge beginning with the next calendar year.  

Electric utilities subject to the requirements of this Section shall be permitted to file new or revised tariffs to comply with the provisions of, and Commission orders entered pursuant to, this Section.

Sec. 16-108.19. Division of Integrated Distribution Planning.  

(a) The Commission shall establish the Division of Integrated Distribution Planning within the Bureau of Public Utilities. The Division shall be staffed by no less than 13 professionals, including engineers, rate analysts, accountants, policy analysts, utility research and analysis analysts, cybersecurity analysts, informational technology specialists, and lawyers to review and evaluate Integrated Grid Plans, updates to Integrated Grid Plans, audits, and other duties as assigned by the Chief of the Public Utilities Bureau.  

(b) The Division of Integrated Distribution Planning shall be established by January 1, 2022.  

(220 ILCS 5/16-108.20 new)  

Sec. 16-108.20. Cost-effectiveness incentive.  

(a) The General Assembly finds that it is critical to maintain this focus on utility bill affordability as the State transitions to a clean energy economy. The General Assembly accordingly finds that it may be in the public interest to incentivize electric utilities to reduce spending where practicable and where such reduction will not have an adverse impact on the State's clean energy goals; this Act's overarching objectives of efficiency, environmental quality, reliability, and equity; or the utility's achievement on its metrics.  

(b) In addition to the performance metrics established and approved by the Commission pursuant to Section 16-108.18 of this Act, the Commission may also determine whether each electric utility that serves more than 500,000 retail customers in the State may also be subject to a performance metric that incentivizes the utility to make cost-effective choices and stretch to achieve cost savings for public utility customers where it can do so without adverse impact (on efficiency, environmental quality, reliability or equity).  

(c) The Commission shall initiate a docket on the subject of cost-effective shared savings, and shall make a determination if it would be in the public interest and the best interest of electric utility customers to establish a performance metric that incentivizes utilities to reduce their costs while meeting all other performance metrics and addressing state goals as found in this Act.  

(d) At the conclusion of the docket, if the Commission determines that such an incentive is in the best interest of consumers, the Commission shall have the authority to set a specific metric as part of the performance metric process pursuant to Section 16-108.18. Such metric shall include a determination of the percentage of the shared savings to be returned to the customers and to the utility. Such percentage shall be set so as to incentivize the utility to make savings, while providing substantial benefits to consumers.  

(220 ILCS 5/16-108.21 new)  

Sec. 16-108.21. Accelerated repayment of excess deferred income tax.  

(a) The General Assembly finds:  

(1) That a portion of each utility's compensation from ratepayers is attributable to reimbursement for federal taxes paid by the utility.  

(2) Due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, the federal income tax rate for corporations was lowered, resulting in excess deferred income tax for distribution utilities in the State that serve more than  

100,000 customers.  

(3) In proceedings before the Commission, it was determined that the repayment period to ratepayers by the utilities which serve more than 100,000 customers in this State for this excess deferred income tax would be 39.5 years.  

(4) The COVID-19 pandemic has harmed many customers of all rate classes in the State, and resulted in the Commission adopting a number of measures to provide relief for customers.  

(5) It would be in the interest of the State for the repayment of the excess deferred income tax referenced in Commission Dockets 19-0436, 19-0387, 20-0381, and 20-0393 to be paid back to ratepayers on a timetable greatly accelerated from that set forth in the dockets.  

(b) Notwithstanding the Commission Orders in Dockets 19-0436, 19-0387, 20-0381, and 20-0382, the excess deferred income tax referenced in those dockets shall be fully refunded to ratepayers by the respective utilities no later than December 31, 2025.  

(c) The Commission shall initiate a docket to provide for the refunding of these excess deferred income taxes to ratepayers of the utilities referenced in those dockets, and shall set forth any necessary provisions to accomplish the reimbursement on the schedule delineated in subsection (b).  

(220 ILCS 5/16-108.25 new)  

Sec. 16-108.25. Tariff regarding transition in rates. Each electric utility that files a Multi-Year Rate Plan pursuant to Section 16-108.18 of this Act or a general rate case as described in this Act shall also file a tariff that sets forth the processes and procedures by which the electric utility will transition from its current rates and ratemaking mechanism to the new Multi-Year Rate Plan or a general rate case and rates that will take effect under that multi-year plan. The proposed tariff shall be consistent with the tariff approved by the Commission in Docket No. 20-0426 and covers the period until the new delivery rates are effective and all required processes and procedures described in the tariff have been completed.  

Each electric utility subject to this Section shall file its proposed tariff no later than 30 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, and the Commission shall enter its order approving the tariff no later than 120 days after it was filed if the Commission finds that the proposed tariff is consistent with the tariff previously approved in Docket No. 20-0426 for the period until the new delivery rates are effective and all required processes and procedures described in the tariff have been completed. If the Commission does not so find, then the Commission shall approve the utility's tariff with those modifications that are required to make the proposed tariff consistent with the tariff approved in Docket 20-0426 until the new delivery rates are effective and all required processes and procedures described in the tariff have been completed.  

An electric utility that has a tariff in effect on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly that provides for the transition from its current rates and ratemaking mechanism to new base rates approved pursuant to Article IX of this Act, shall file a compliance tariff modifying its existing tariff to comply with the provisions of this Section. The compliance tariff shall go into effect on 45 days' notice.  

(220 ILCS 5/16-108.30 new) Sec. 16-108.30. Energy Transition Assistance Fund.  

(a) The Energy Transition Assistance Fund is hereby created as a special fund in the State Treasury. The Energy Transition Assistance Fund is authorized to receive moneys collected pursuant to this Section. Subject to appropriation, the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity shall use moneys from the Energy Transition Assistance Fund consistent with the purposes of this Act.  

(b) An electric utility serving more than 500,000 customers in the State shall assess an energy transition assistance charge on all its retail customers for the Energy Transition Assistance Fund. The utility's total charge shall be set based upon the value determined by the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity pursuant to subsection (d) or (e), as applicable, of Section 605-1075 of the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity Law of the Civil Administrative Code of Illinois. For each utility, the charge shall be recovered through a single, uniform cents per kilowatt-hour charge applicable to all retail customers. For each utility, the charge shall not exceed 1.3% of the amount paid per kilowatthour by those customers during the year ending May 31, 2009.  

(c) Within 75 days of the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, each electric utility serving more than 500,000 customers in the State shall file with the Illinois Commerce Commission tariffs incorporating the energy transition assistance charge in other charges stated in such tariffs, which energy transition assistance charges shall become effective no later than the beginning of the first billing cycle that begins on or after January 1, 2022. Each electric utility serving more than 500,000 customers in the State shall, prior to the beginning of each calendar year starting with calendar year 2023, file with the Illinois Commerce Commission tariff revisions to incorporate annual revisions to the energy transition assistance charge as prescribed by the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity pursuant to Section 605-1075 of the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity Law of the  

Civil Administrative Code of Illinois so that such revision becomes effective no later than the beginning of the first billing cycle in each respective year.  

(d) The energy transition assistance charge shall be considered a charge for public utility service.  

(e) By the 20th day of the month following the month in which the charges imposed by this Section were collected, each electric utility serving more than 500,000 customers in the State shall remit to Department of Revenue all moneys received as payment of the energy transition assistance charge on a return prescribed and furnished by the Department of Revenue showing such information as the Department of Revenue may reasonably require. If a customer makes a partial payment, a public utility may apply such partial payments first to amounts owed to the utility. No customer may be subjected to disconnection of his or her utility service for failure to pay the energy transition assistance charge.  

If any payment provided for in this subsection exceeds the   
electric utility's liabilities under this Act, as shown on an   
original return, the Department may authorize the electric   
utility to credit such excess payment against liability   
subsequently to be remitted to the Department under this Act,   
in accordance with reasonable rules adopted by the Department. All the provisions of Sections 4, 5, 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e,   
5f, 5g, 5i, 5j, 6, 6a, 6b, 6c, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11a, 12, and 13   
of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act that are not inconsistent  

with this Act apply, as far as practicable, to the charge imposed by this Act to the same extent as if those provisions were included in this Act. References in the incorporated Sections of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act to retailers, to sellers, or to persons engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property mean persons required to remit the charge imposed under this Act.  

(f) The Department of Revenue shall deposit into the Energy Transition Assistance Fund all moneys remitted to it in accordance with this Section. (g) The Department of Revenue may establish such rules as it deems necessary to implement this Section. (h) The Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity may establish such rules as it deems necessary to implement this Section.

Sec. 16-111.5. Provisions relating to procurement.  

(a) An electric utility that on December 31, 2005 served at least 100,000 customers in Illinois shall procure power and energy for its eligible retail customers in accordance with the applicable provisions set forth in Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act and this Section. Beginning with the delivery year commencing on June 1, 2017, such electric utility shall also procure zero emission credits from zero emission facilities in accordance with the applicable provisions set forth in Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, and, for years beginning on or after June 1, 2017, the utility shall procure renewable energy resources in accordance with the applicable provisions set forth in Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act and this Section. Beginning with the delivery year commencing on June 1, 2022, an electric utility serving over 3,000,000 customers shall also procure carbon mitigation credits from carbon-free energy resources in accordance with the applicable provisions set forth in Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act and this Section. A small multi-jurisdictional electric utility that on December 31, 2005 served less than 100,000 customers in Illinois may elect to procure power and energy for all or a portion of its eligible Illinois retail customers in accordance with the applicable provisions set forth in this Section and Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act. This Section shall not apply to a small multi-jurisdictional utility until such time as a small multi-jurisdictional utility requests the Illinois Power Agency to prepare a procurement plan for its eligible retail customers. "Eligible retail customers" for the purposes of this Section means those retail customers that purchase power and energy from the electric utility under fixed-price bundled service tariffs, other than those retail customers whose service is declared or deemed competitive under Section 16-113 and those other customer groups specified in this Section, including self-generating customers, customers electing hourly pricing, or those customers who are otherwise ineligible for fixed-price bundled tariff service. For those customers that are excluded from the procurement plan's electric supply service requirements, and the utility shall procure any supply requirements, including capacity, ancillary services, and hourly priced energy, in the applicable markets as needed to serve those customers, provided that the utility may include in its procurement plan load requirements for the load that is associated with those retail customers whose service has been declared or deemed competitive pursuant to Section 16-113 of this Act to the extent that those customers are purchasing power and energy during one of the transition periods identified in subsection (b) of Section 16-113 of this Act.  

(b) A procurement plan shall be prepared for each electric utility consistent with the applicable requirements of the Illinois Power Agency Act and this Section. For purposes of this Section, Illinois electric utilities that are affiliated by virtue of a common parent company are considered to be a single electric utility. Small multi-jurisdictional utilities may request a procurement plan for a portion of or all of its Illinois load. Each procurement plan shall analyze the projected balance of supply and demand for those retail customers to be included in the plan's electric supply service requirements over a 5-year period, with the first planning year beginning on June 1 of the year following the year in which the plan is filed. The plan shall specifically identify the wholesale products to be procured following plan approval, and shall follow all the requirements set forth in the Public Utilities Act and all applicable State and federal laws, statutes, rules, or regulations, as well as Commission orders. Nothing in this Section precludes consideration of contracts longer than 5 years and related forecast data. Unless specified otherwise in this Section, in the procurement plan or in the implementing tariff, any procurement occurring in accordance with this plan shall be competitively bid through a request for proposals process. Approval and implementation of the procurement plan shall be subject to review and approval by the Commission according to the provisions set forth in this Section. A procurement plan shall include each of the following components:  

(1) Hourly load analysis. This analysis shall include: (i) multi-year historical analysis of hourly   
loads; (ii) switching trends and competitive retail   
market analysis; (iii) known or projected changes to future loads;   
and (iv) growth forecasts by customer class.  

(2) Analysis of the impact of any demand side and renewable energy initiatives. This analysis shall include: (i) the impact of demand response programs and energy efficiency programs, both current and projected; for small multi-jurisdictional utilities, the impact of demand response and energy efficiency programs approved pursuant to Section 8-408 of this Act, both current and projected; and  

(ii) supply side needs that are projected to be offset by purchases of renewable energy resources, if any.  

(3) A plan for meeting the expected load requirements that will not be met through preexisting contracts. This plan shall include:  

(i) definitions of the different Illinois retail customer classes for which supply is being purchased; (ii) the proposed mix of demand-response products for which contracts will be executed during the next year. For small multi-jurisdictional electric utilities that on December 31, 2005 served fewer than 100,000 customers in Illinois, these shall be defined as demand-response products offered in an energy efficiency plan approved pursuant to Section 8-408 of this Act. The cost-effective demand-response measures shall be procured whenever the cost is lower than procuring comparable capacity products, provided that such products shall:  

(A) be procured by a demand-response provider from those retail customers included in the plan's electric supply service requirements;  

(B) at least satisfy the demand-response requirements of the regional transmission organization market in which the utility's service territory is located, including, but not limited to, any applicable capacity or dispatch requirements;  

(C) provide for customers' participation in the stream of benefits produced by the demand-response products;  

(D) provide for reimbursement by the demand-response provider of the utility for any costs incurred as a result of the failure of the supplier of such products to perform its obligations thereunder; and  

(E) meet the same credit requirements as apply to suppliers of capacity, in the applicable regional transmission organization market;  

(iii) monthly forecasted system supply requirements, including expected minimum, maximum, and average values for the planning period;  

(iv) the proposed mix and selection of standard wholesale products for which contracts will be executed during the next year, separately or in combination, to meet that portion of its load requirements not met through pre-existing contracts, including but not limited to monthly 5 x 16 peak period block energy, monthly off-peak wrap energy, monthly 7 x 24 energy, annual 5 x 16 energy, other standardized energy or capacity products designed to provide eligible retail customer benefits from commercially deployed advanced technologies including but not limited to high voltage direct current converter stations, as such term is defined in Section 1-10 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, whether or not such product is currently available in wholesale markets, annual off-peak wrap energy, annual 7 x 24 energy, monthly capacity, annual capacity, peak load capacity obligations, capacity purchase plan, and ancillary services;  

(v) proposed term structures for each wholesale product type included in the proposed procurement plan portfolio of products; and  

(vi) an assessment of the price risk, load uncertainty, and other factors that are associated with the proposed procurement plan; this assessment, to the extent possible, shall include an analysis of the following factors: contract terms, time frames for securing products or services, fuel costs, weather patterns, transmission costs, market conditions, and the governmental regulatory environment; the proposed procurement plan shall also identify alternatives for those portfolio measures that are identified as having significant price risk and mitigation in the form of additional retail customer and ratepayer price, reliability, and environmental benefits from standardized energy products delivered from commercially deployed advanced technologies, including, but not limited to, high voltage direct current converter stations, as such term is defined in Section 1-10 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, whether or not such product is currently available in wholesale markets.  

(4) Proposed procedures for balancing loads. The procurement plan shall include, for load requirements included in the procurement plan, the process for (i) hourly balancing of supply and demand and (ii) the criteria for portfolio re-balancing in the event of significant shifts in load.  

(5) Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan. The Agency shall prepare a long-term renewable resources procurement plan for the procurement of renewable energy credits under Sections 1-56 and 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act for delivery beginning in the 2017 delivery year.  

(i) The initial long-term renewable resources procurement plan and all subsequent revisions shall be subject to review and approval by the Commission. For the purposes of this Section, "delivery year" has the same meaning as in Section 1-10 of the Illinois Power Agency Act. For purposes of this Section, "Agency" shall mean the Illinois Power Agency.  

(ii) The long-term renewable resources planning process shall be conducted as follows:  

(A) Electric utilities shall provide a range of load forecasts to the Illinois Power Agency within 45 days of the Agency's request for forecasts, which request shall specify the length and conditions for the forecasts including, but not limited to, the quantity of distributed generation expected to be interconnected for each year.  

(B) The Agency shall publish for comment the initial long-term renewable resources procurement plan no later than 120 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly and shall review, and may revise, the plan at least every 2 years thereafter. To the extent practicable, the Agency shall review and propose any revisions to the long-term renewable energy resources procurement plan in conjunction with the Agency's other planning and approval processes conducted under this Section. The initial long-term renewable resources procurement  

plan shall:  

(aa) Identify the procurement programs and competitive procurement events consistent with the applicable requirements of the Illinois Power Agency Act and shall be designed to achieve the goals set forth in subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of that Act.

Within 10 days after the filing, the Commission shall determine whether a hearing is necessary. The Commission shall enter its order confirming or modifying the procurement plan within 90 days after the filing of the procurement plan by the Illinois Power Agency.  

(4) The Commission shall approve the procurement plan, including expressly the forecast used in the procurement plan, if the Commission determines that it will ensure adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and environmentally sustainable electric service at the lowest total cost over time, taking into account any benefits of price stability.  

(4.5) The Commission shall review the Agency's recommendations for the selection of applicants to enter into long-term contracts for the sale and delivery of renewable energy credits from new renewable energy facilities to be constructed at or adjacent to the sites of coal-fueled electric generating facilities in this State in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, and shall approve the Agency's recommendations if the Commission determines that the applicants recommended by the Agency for selection, the proposed new renewable energy facilities to be constructed, the amounts of renewable energy credits to be delivered pursuant to the contracts, and the other terms of the contracts, are consistent with the requirements of subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act.  

(e) The procurement process shall include each of the following components:  

(1) Solicitation, pre-qualification, and registration of bidders. The procurement administrator shall disseminate information to potential bidders to promote a procurement event, notify potential bidders that the procurement administrator may enter into a post-bid price negotiation with bidders that meet the applicable benchmarks, provide supply requirements, and otherwise explain the competitive procurement process. In addition to such other publication as the procurement administrator determines is appropriate, this information shall be posted on the Illinois Power Agency's and the Commission's websites. The procurement administrator shall also administer the prequalification process, including evaluation of credit worthiness, compliance with procurement rules, and agreement to the standard form contract developed pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection (e). The procurement administrator shall then identify and register bidders to participate in the procurement event.  

(2) Standard contract forms and credit terms and instruments. The procurement administrator, in consultation with the utilities, the Commission, and other interested parties and subject to Commission oversight, shall develop and provide standard contract forms for the supplier contracts that meet generally accepted industry practices. Standard credit terms and instruments that meet generally accepted industry practices shall be similarly developed. The procurement administrator shall make available to the Commission all written comments it receives on the contract forms, credit terms, or instruments. If the procurement administrator cannot reach agreement with the applicable electric utility as to the contract terms and conditions, the procurement administrator must notify the Commission of any disputed terms and the Commission shall resolve the dispute. The terms of the contracts shall not be subject to negotiation by winning bidders, and the bidders must agree to the terms of the contract in advance so that winning bids are selected solely on the basis of price.  

(3) Establishment of a market-based price benchmark. As part of the development of the procurement process, the procurement administrator, in consultation with the Commission staff, Agency staff, and the procurement monitor, shall establish benchmarks for evaluating the final prices in the contracts for each of the products that will be procured through the procurement process. The benchmarks shall be based on price data for similar products for the same delivery period and same delivery hub, or other delivery hubs after adjusting for that difference. The price benchmarks may also be adjusted to take into account differences between the information reflected in the underlying data sources and the specific products and procurement process being used to procure power for the Illinois utilities. The benchmarks shall be confidential but shall be provided to, and will be subject to Commission review and approval, prior to a procurement event.  

(4) Request for proposals competitive procurement process. The procurement administrator shall design and issue a request for proposals to supply electricity in accordance with each utility's procurement plan, as approved by the Commission. The request for proposals shall set forth a procedure for sealed, binding commitment bidding with pay-as-bid settlement, and provision for selection of bids on the basis of price.  

(5) A plan for implementing contingencies in the event of supplier default or failure of the procurement process to fully meet the expected load requirement due to insufficient supplier participation, Commission rejection of results, or any other cause.  

(i) Event of supplier default: In the event of supplier default, the utility shall review the contract of the defaulting supplier to determine if the amount of supply is 200 megawatts or greater, and if there are more than 60 days remaining of the contract term. If both of these conditions are met, and the default results in termination of the contract, the utility shall immediately notify the Illinois Power Agency that a request for proposals must be issued to procure replacement power, and the procurement administrator shall run an additional procurement event. If the contracted supply of the defaulting supplier is less than 200 megawatts or there are less than 60 days remaining of the contract term, the utility shall procure power and energy from the applicable regional transmission organization market, including ancillary services, capacity, and day-ahead or real time energy, or both, for the duration of the contract term to replace the contracted supply; provided, however, that if a needed product is not available through the regional transmission organization market it shall be purchased from the wholesale market.  

(ii) Failure of the procurement process to fully meet the expected load requirement: If the procurement process fails to fully meet the expected load requirement due to insufficient supplier participation or due to a Commission rejection of the procurement results, the procurement administrator, the procurement monitor, and the Commission staff shall meet within 10 days to analyze potential causes of low supplier interest or causes for the Commission decision. If changes are identified that would likely result in increased supplier participation, or that would address concerns causing the Commission to reject the results of the prior procurement event, the procurement administrator may implement those changes and rerun the request for proposals process according to a schedule determined by those parties and consistent with Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act and this subsection. In any event, a new request for proposals process shall be implemented by the procurement administrator within 90 days after the determination that the procurement process has failed to fully meet the expected load requirement.  

(iii) In all cases where there is insufficient supply provided under contracts awarded through the procurement process to fully meet the electric utility's load requirement, the utility shall meet the load requirement by procuring power and energy from the applicable regional transmission organization market, including ancillary services, capacity, and day-ahead or real time energy, or both; provided, however, that if a needed product is not available through the regional transmission organization market it shall be purchased from the wholesale market.  

(6) The procurement processes process described in this subsection and in subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act are is exempt from the requirements of the Illinois Procurement Code, pursuant to Section 20-10 of that Code.  

(f) Within 2 business days after opening the sealed bids, the procurement administrator shall submit a confidential report to the Commission. The report shall contain the results of the bidding for each of the products along with the procurement administrator's recommendation for the acceptance and rejection of bids based on the price benchmark criteria and other factors observed in the process. The procurement monitor also shall submit a confidential report to the  

Commission within 2 business days after opening the sealed bids. The report shall contain the procurement monitor's assessment of bidder behavior in the process as well as an assessment of the procurement administrator's compliance with the procurement process and rules. The Commission shall review the confidential reports submitted by the procurement administrator and procurement monitor, and shall accept or reject the recommendations of the procurement administrator within 2 business days after receipt of the reports.  

(g) Within 3 business days after the Commission decision approving the results of a procurement event, the utility shall enter into binding contractual arrangements with the winning suppliers using the standard form contracts; except that the utility shall not be required either directly or indirectly to execute the contracts if a tariff that is consistent with subsection (l) of this Section has not been approved and placed into effect for that utility.  

(h) For the procurement of standard wholesale products, the names of the successful bidders and the load weighted average of the winning bid prices for each contract type and for each contract term shall be made available to the public at the time of Commission approval of a procurement event. For procurements conducted to meet the requirements of subsection (b) of Section 1-56 or subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act governed by the provisions of this Section, the address and nameplate capacity of the new renewable energy generating facility proposed by a winning bidder shall also be made available to the public at the time of Commission approval of a procurement event, along with the business address and contact information for any winning bidder. An estimate or approximation of the nameplate capacity of the new renewable energy generating facility may be disclosed if necessary to protect the confidentiality of individual bid prices.  

The Commission, the procurement monitor, the procurement administrator, the Illinois Power Agency, and all participants in the procurement process shall maintain the confidentiality of all other supplier and bidding information in a manner consistent with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and tariffs. Confidential information, including the confidential reports submitted by the procurement administrator and procurement monitor pursuant to subsection (f) of this Section, shall not be made publicly available and shall not be discoverable by any party in any proceeding, absent a compelling demonstration of need, nor shall those reports be admissible in any proceeding other than one for law enforcement purposes. The names of the successful bidders and the load weighted average of the winning bid prices for each contract type and for each contract term shall be made available to the public at the time of Commission approval of a procurement event. The Commission, the procurement monitor, the procurement administrator, the Illinois Power Agency, and all participants in the procurement process shall maintain the confidentiality of all other supplier and bidding information in a manner consistent with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and tariffs. Confidential information, including the confidential reports submitted by the procurement administrator and procurement monitor pursuant to subsection (f) of this Section, shall not be made publicly available and shall not be discoverable by any party in any proceeding, absent a compelling demonstration of need, nor shall those reports be admissible in any proceeding other than one for law enforcement purposes.  

(i) Within 2 business days after a Commission decision approving the results of a procurement event or such other date as may be required by the Commission from time to time, the utility shall file for informational purposes with the Commission its actual or estimated retail supply charges, as applicable, by customer supply group reflecting the costs associated with the procurement and computed in accordance with the tariffs filed pursuant to subsection (l) of this Section and approved by the Commission.  

(j) Within 60 days following August 28, 2007 (the effective date of Public Act 95-481), each electric utility that on December 31, 2005 provided electric service to at least 100,000 customers in Illinois shall prepare and file with the Commission an initial procurement plan, which shall conform in all material respects to the requirements of the procurement plan set forth in subsection (b); provided, however, that the Illinois Power Agency Act shall not apply to the initial procurement plan prepared pursuant to this subsection. The initial procurement plan shall identify the portfolio of power and energy products to be procured and delivered for the period June 2008 through May 2009, and shall identify the proposed procurement administrator, who shall have the same experience and expertise as is required of a procurement administrator hired pursuant to Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act. Copies of the procurement plan shall be posted and made publicly available on the Commission's website. The initial procurement plan may include contracts for renewable resources that extend beyond May 2009.  

(i) Within 14 days following filing of the initial procurement plan, any person may file a detailed objection with the Commission contesting the procurement plan submitted by the electric utility. All objections to the electric utility's plan shall be specific, supported by data or other detailed analyses. The electric utility may file a response to any objections to its procurement plan within 7 days after the date objections are due to be filed. Within 7 days after the date the utility's response is due, the Commission shall determine whether a hearing is necessary. If it determines that a hearing is necessary, it shall require the hearing to be completed and issue an order on the procurement plan within 60 days after the filing of the procurement plan by the electric utility.  

(ii) The order shall approve or modify the procurement plan, approve an independent procurement administrator, and approve or modify the electric utility's tariffs that are proposed with the initial procurement plan. The Commission shall approve the procurement plan if the Commission determines that it will ensure adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and environmentally sustainable electric service at the lowest total cost over time, taking into account any benefits of price stability.  

(k) (Blank).   
(k-5) (Blank).  

(l) An electric utility shall recover its costs incurred under this Section and subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, including, but not limited to, the costs of procuring power and energy demand-response resources under this Section and its costs for purchasing renewable energy credits pursuant to subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act. The utility shall file with the initial procurement plan its proposed tariffs through which its costs of procuring power that are incurred pursuant to a Commission-approved procurement plan and those other costs identified in this subsection (l), will be recovered. The tariffs shall include a formula rate or charge designed to pass through both the costs incurred by the utility in procuring a supply of electric power and energy for the applicable customer classes with no mark-up or return on the price paid by the utility for that supply, plus any just and reasonable costs that the utility incurs in arranging and providing for the supply of electric power and energy. The formula rate or charge shall also contain provisions that ensure that its application does not result in over or under recovery due to changes in customer usage and demand patterns, and that provide for the correction, on at least an annual basis, of any accounting errors that may occur. A utility shall recover through the tariff all reasonable costs incurred to implement or comply with any procurement plan that is developed and put into effect pursuant to Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act and this Section, and for the procurement of renewable energy credits pursuant to subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, including any fees assessed by the Illinois Power Agency, costs associated with load balancing, and contingency plan costs. The electric utility shall also recover its full costs of procuring electric supply for which it contracted before the effective date of this Section in conjunction with the provision of full requirements service under fixed-price bundled service tariffs subsequent to December 31, 2006. All such costs shall be deemed to have been prudently incurred. The pass-through tariffs that are filed and approved pursuant to this Section shall not be subject to review under, or in any way limited by, Section 16-111(i) of this Act. All of the costs incurred by the electric utility associated with the purchase of zero emission credits in accordance with subsection (d-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, all costs incurred by the electric utility associated with the purchase of carbon mitigation credits in accordance with subsection (d-10) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, and, beginning June 1, 2017, all of the costs incurred by the electric utility associated with the purchase of renewable energy resources in accordance with Sections 1-56 and 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, and all of the costs incurred by the electric utility in purchasing renewable energy credits in accordance with subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, shall be recovered through the electric utility's tariffed charges applicable to all of its retail customers, as specified in subsection (k) or subsection (i-5), as applicable, of Section 16-108 of this Act, and shall not be recovered through the electric utility's tariffed charges for electric power and energy supply to its eligible retail customers.  

(m) The Commission has the authority to adopt rules to carry out the provisions of this Section. For the public interest, safety, and welfare, the Commission also has authority to adopt rules to carry out the provisions of this Section on an emergency basis immediately following August 28, 2007 (the effective date of Public Act 95-481).  

(n) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, any affiliated electric utilities that submit a single procurement plan covering their combined needs may procure for those combined needs in conjunction with that plan, and may enter jointly into power supply contracts, purchases, and other procurement arrangements, and allocate capacity and energy and cost responsibility therefor among themselves in proportion to their requirements.  

(o) On or before June 1 of each year, the Commission shall hold an informal hearing for the purpose of receiving comments on the prior year's procurement process and any recommendations for change.  

(p) An electric utility subject to this Section may propose to invest, lease, own, or operate an electric generation facility as part of its procurement plan, provided the utility demonstrates that such facility is the least-cost option to provide electric service to those retail customers included in the plan's electric supply service requirements. If the facility is shown to be the least-cost option and is included in a procurement plan prepared in accordance with Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act and this Section, then the electric utility shall make a filing pursuant to Section 8-406 of this Act, and may request of the Commission any statutory relief required thereunder. If the Commission grants all of the necessary approvals for the proposed facility, such supply shall thereafter be considered as a pre-existing contract under subsection (b) of this Section. The Commission shall in any order approving a proposal under this subsection specify how the utility will recover the prudently incurred costs of investing in, leasing, owning, or operating such generation facility through just and reasonable rates charged to those retail customers included in the plan's electric supply service requirements. Cost recovery for facilities included in the utility's procurement plan pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to review under or in any way limited by the provisions of Section 16-111(i) of this Act. Nothing in this Section is intended to prohibit a utility from filing for a fuel adjustment clause as is otherwise permitted under Section 9-220 of this Act.  

(q) If the Illinois Power Agency filed with the Commission, under Section 16-111.5 of this Act, its proposed procurement plan for the period commencing June 1, 2017, and the Commission has not yet entered its final order approving the plan on or before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly, then the Illinois Power Agency shall file a notice of withdrawal with the Commission, after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly, to withdraw the proposed procurement of renewable energy resources to be approved under the plan, other than the procurement of renewable energy credits from distributed renewable energy generation devices using funds previously collected from electric utilities' retail customers that take service pursuant to electric utilities' hourly pricing tariff or tariffs and, for an electric utility that serves less than 100,000 retail customers in the State, other than the procurement of renewable energy credits from distributed renewable energy generation devices. Upon receipt of the notice, the Commission shall enter an order that approves the withdrawal of the proposed procurement of renewable energy resources from the plan. The initially proposed procurement of renewable energy resources shall not be approved or be the subject of any further hearing, investigation, proceeding, or order of any kind.  

This amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly preempts and supersedes any order entered by the Commission that approved the Illinois Power Agency's procurement plan for the period commencing June 1, 2017, to the extent it is inconsistent with the provisions of this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly. To the extent any previously entered order approved the procurement of renewable energy resources, the portion of that order approving the procurement shall be void, other than the procurement of renewable energy credits from distributed renewable energy generation devices using funds previously collected from electric utilities' retail customers that take service under electric utilities' hourly pricing tariff or tariffs and, for an electric utility that serves less than 100,000 retail customers in the State, other than the procurement of renewable energy credits for distributed renewable energy generation devices.

Sec. 16-111.10. Equitable Energy Upgrade Program.  

(a) The General Assembly finds and declares that Illinois homes and businesses can contribute to the creation of a clean energy economy, conservation of natural resources, and reliability of the electricity grid through the installation of cost-effective renewable energy generation, energy efficiency and demand response equipment, and energy storage systems. Further, a large portion of Illinois residents and businesses that would benefit from the installation of energy efficiency, storage, and renewable energy generation systems are unable to purchase systems due to capital or credit barriers. This State should pursue options to enable many more Illinoisans to access the health, environmental, and financial benefits of new clean energy technology.  

(b) As used in this Section:  

"Commission" means the Illinois Commerce Commission.  

"Energy project" means renewable energy generation systems, including solar projects, energy efficiency upgrades, energy storage systems, demand response equipment, or any combination thereof.  

"Fund" means the Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund established in the Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund Act.  

"Program" means the Equitable Energy Upgrade Program established under subsection (c).  

"Utility" means electric public utilities providing services to 500,000 or more customers under this Act.  

(c) The Commission shall open an investigation into and direct all electric public utilities in this State to adopt an Equitable Energy Upgrade Program that permits customers to finance the construction of energy projects through an optional tariff payable directly through their utility bill, modeled after the Pay As You Save system, developed by the Energy Efficiency Institute. The Program model shall enable utilities to offer to make investments in energy projects to customer properties with low-cost capital and use an opt-in tariff to recover the costs. The Program shall be designed to provide customers with immediate financial savings if they choose to participate. The Program shall allow residential electric utility customers that own the property, or renters that have permission of the property owner, for which they subscribe to utility service to agree to the installation of an energy project. The Program shall ensure:  

(1) eligible projects do not require upfront payments; however, customers may pay down the costs for projects with a payment to the installing contractor in order to qualify projects that would otherwise require upfront payments;  

(2) eligible projects have sufficient estimated savings and estimated life span to produce significant, immediate net savings;  

(3) participants shall agree the utility can recover its costs for the projects at their location by paying for the project through an optional tariff directly through the participant's electricity bill, allowing participants to benefit from installation of energy projects without traditional loans;  

(4) accessibility by lower-income residents and environmental justice community residents; and  

(5) the utility must ensure that customers who are interested in participating are notified that if they are income qualified, they may also be eligible for the Percentage of Income Payment Plan program and free energy improvements through other programs and provide contact information.  

(d) The Commission shall establish Program guidelines with the anticipated schedule of Program availability as follows:  

(1) Year 1: Beginning in the first year of operation, each utility with greater than 100,000 retail customers is required to obtain low-cost capital of at least \$20,000,000 annually for investments in energy projects.  

(2) Year 2: Beginning in the second year of operation, each utility with greater than 100,000 retail customers is required to obtain low-cost capital for investments in energy projects of at least \$40,000,000 annually.  

(3) Year 3: Beginning in the third year of operation, each utility with greater than 100,000 retail customers is required to obtain low-cost capital for investments in as many systems as customers demand, subject to available capital provided by the utility, State, or other lenders. (e) In the design of the Program, the Commission shall:  

(1) Within 270 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, convene a workshop during which interested participants may discuss issues and submit comments related to the Program.  

(2) Establish Program guidelines for implementation of the Program in accordance with the Pay As You Save Essential Elements and Minimum Program Requirements that electric utilities must abide by when implementing the Program. Program guidelines established by the Commission shall include the following elements:  

(A) The Commission shall establish conditions under which utilities secure capital to fund the energy projects. The Commission may allow utilities to raise capital independently, work with third-party lenders to secure the capital for participants, or a combination thereof. Any process the Commission approves must use a market mechanism to identify the least costly sources of capital funds so as to pass on maximum savings to participants. The State or the Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund may also provide  

capital for the Program.  

(B) Customer protection guidelines should be designed consistent with Pay As You Save Essential Elements and Minimum Program Requirements.  

(C) The Commission shall establish conditions by which utilities may connect Program participants to energy project vendors. In setting conditions for connection, the Commission may prioritize vendors that have a history of good relations with the State, including vendors that have hired participants from State-created job training programs.  

(D) Guarantee that conservative estimates of financial savings will immediately and significantly exceed Program costs for Program participants.  

(f) Within 120 days after the Commission releases the Program conditions established under this Section, each utility subject to the requirements of this Section shall submit an informational filing to the Commission that describes its plan for implementing the provisions of this Section. If the Commission finds that the submission does not properly comply with the statutory or regulatory requirements of the Program, the Commission may require that the utility make modifications to its filing.  

(g) An independent process evaluation shall be conducted after one year of the Program's operation. An independent impact evaluation shall be conducted after 3 years of operation, excluding one-time startup costs and results from the first 12 months of the Program. The Commission shall convene an advisory council of stakeholders, including representation of low-income and environmental justice community members to make recommendations in response to the findings of the independent evaluation.  

(h) The Program shall be designed using the Pay As You Save   
system guidelines to be cost-effective for customers. Only   
projects that are deemed to be cost-effective and can be   
reasonably expected to ensure customer savings are eligible   
for funding through the Program, unless, as specified in   
paragraph (1) of subsection (c), customers able to make   
upfront copayments to installers buy down the cost of projects   
so it can be deemed cost-effective. (i) Eligible customers must be: (1) property renters with permission of the property owner; or (2) property owners. (j) The calculation of project cost-effectiveness shall be   
based upon the Pay As You Save system requirements. (1) The calculation of cost-effectiveness must be conducted by an objective process approved by the Commission and based on rates in effect at the time of installation. (2) A project shall be considered cost-effective only if it is estimated to produce significant immediate net  

savings, not counting copayments voluntarily made by customers. The Commission may establish guidelines by which this required savings is estimated.  

(k) The Program should be modeled after the Pay As You Save system, by which Program participants finance energy projects using the savings that the energy project creates with a tariffed on-bill program. Eligible projects shall not create personal debt for the customer, result in a lien in the event of nonpayment, or require customers to pay monthly charges for any upgrade that fails and is not repaired within 21 days. The utility may restart charges once the upgrade is repaired and functioning and extend the term of payments to recover its costs for missed payments and deferred cost recovery, providing the upgrade continues to function.  

(l) Any energy project that is defective or damaged due to no fault of the participant must be either replaced or repaired with parts that meet industry standards at the cost of the utility or vendor, as specified by the Commission, and charges shall be suspended until repairs or replacement is completed. The Commission may establish, increase, or replace the requirements imposed in this subsection. The Commission may determine that this responsibility is best handled by participating project vendors in the form of insurance, contractual guarantees, or other mechanisms, and issue rules detailing this requirement. Customers shall not be charged monthly payments for upgrades that are no longer functioning.  

(m) In the event of nonpayment, the remaining balance due to pay off the system shall remain with the utility meter at an upgraded location. The Commission shall establish conditions subject to this constraint in the event of nonpayment that are in accordance with the Pay As You Save system.  

(n) If the demand by utility customers exceeds the Program capital supply in a given year, utilities shall ensure that 50% of participants are:  

(1) customers in neighborhoods where a majority of households make 150% or less of area median income; or (2) residents of environmental justice communities.  

(o) Utilities shall endeavor to inform customers about the availability of the Program, their potential eligibility for participation in the Program, and whether they are likely to save money on the basis of an estimate conducted using variables consistent with the Program that the utility has at its disposal. The Commission may establish guidelines by which utilities must abide by this directive and alternatives if the Commission deems utilities' efforts as inadequate.  

(p) Subject to Commission specifications under subsection (c), each utility shall work with certified project vendors selected using a request for proposals process to establish the terms and processes under which a utility can install eligible renewable energy generation and energy storage systems using the capital to fit the Equitable Energy Upgrade model. The certified project vendor shall explain and offer the approved upgrades to customers and shall assist customers in applying for financing through the Program. As part of the process, vendors shall also provide participants with information about any other relevant incentives that may be available.  

(q) An electric utility shall recover all of the prudently incurred costs of offering a program approved by the Commission under this Section. For investor-owned utilities, shareholder incentives will be proportional to meeting Commission approved thresholds for the number of customers served and the amount of its investments in those locations. (r) The Commission shall adopt all rules necessary for the administration of this Section.

(220 ILCS 5/17-900 new) Sec. 17-900. Customer self-generation of electricity.  

(a) The General Assembly finds and declares that municipal systems and electric cooperatives shall continue to be governed by their respective governing bodies, but that such governing bodies should recognize and implement policies to provide the opportunity for their residential and small commercial customers who wish to self-generate electricity and for reasonable credits to customers for excess electricity, balanced against the rights of the other non-self-generating customers. This includes creating consistent, fair policies that are accessible to all customers and transparent, fair processes for raising and addressing any concerns.  

(b) Customers have the right to install renewable generating facilities to be located on the customer's premises or customer's side of the billing meter and that are intended primarily to offset the customer's own electrical requirements and produce, consume, and store their own renewable energy  

SB2408 Enrolled LRB102 11366 BMS 16699 b   
without discriminatory repercussions from an electric perative or municipal system. This includes a customer's   
rights to: (1) generate, consume, and deliver excess renewable energy to the distribution grid and reduce his or her use of electricity obtained from the grid; (2) use technology to store energy at his or her residence; (3) interconnect his or her electrical system that generates renewable energy, stores energy, or any combination thereof, with the electricity meter on the customer's premises that is provided by an electric cooperative or municipal system: (A) in a timely manner; (B) in accordance with requirements established by the electric cooperative or municipal utility to ensure the safety of utility workers; and (C) after providing written notice to the electric cooperative or municipal utility system providing service in the service territory, installing a nomenclature plate on the electrical meter panel and meeting all applicable State and local safety and electrical code requirements associated with installing a parallel distributed generation system; and (4) receive fair credit for excess energy delivered to  

the distribution grid.  

(c) The policies of municipal systems and electric cooperatives regarding self-generation and credits for excess electricity may reasonably differ from those required of other entities by Article XVI of the Public Utilities Act or other Acts. The credits must recognize the value of self-generation to the distribution grid and benefits to other customers.  

(d) Within 180 days after this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, each electric cooperative and municipal system shall update its policies for the interconnection and fair crediting of customer self-generation and storage if necessary, to comply with the standards of subsection (b) of this Section. Each electric cooperative and municipal system shall post its updated policies to a public-facing area of its website.  

(e) An electric cooperative or municipal system customer who produces, consumes, and stores his or her own renewable energy shall not face discriminatory rate design, fees or charges, treatment, or excessive compliance requirements that would unreasonably affect that customer's right to self-generate electricity as provided for in this Section.  

(f) An electric cooperative or municipal utility system customer shall have a right to appeal any decision related to self-generation and storage that violates these rights to self-generation and non-discrimination pursuant to the provisions of this Section through a complaint under the  

Administrative Review Law or similar legal process.

Sec. 9.18. Commission on market-based carbon pricing solutions.  

(a) In the United States, state-based market policies to reduce greenhouse gases have been in operation since 2009. More than a quarter of the US population lives in a state with carbon pricing and these states represent one-third of the United States' gross domestic product. Market-based policies have proved effective at reducing emissions in states across the United States, and around the world. Additionally, well-designed carbon pricing incentivizes energy efficiency and drives investments in low-carbon solutions and technologies, such as renewables, hydrogen, biofuels, and carbon capture, use, and storage. Illinois must assess available suites of programs and policies to support a rapid, economy-wide decarbonization and spur the development of a clean energy economy in the State, while maintaining Illinois' competitive advantage.  

(b) The Governor is hereby authorized to create a carbon pricing commission to study the short-term and long-term impacts of joining, implementing, or designing a sector-based, statewide, or regional carbon pricing program. The commission shall analyze and compare the relative cost of, and greenhouse gas reductions from, various carbon pricing programs available to Illinois and the Midwest, including, but not limited to: the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the Transportation and Climate Initiative (TCI), California's cap-and-trade program, California's low carbon fuel standard, Washington State's cap-and-invest program, the Oregon Clean Fuels Program, and other relevant market-based programs. At the conclusion of the study, no later than December 31, 2022, the commission shall issue a public report containing its findings.  

(c) This Section is repealed on January 1, 2024.  

(415 ILCS 5/22.59)  

Sec. 22.59. CCR surface impoundments.
