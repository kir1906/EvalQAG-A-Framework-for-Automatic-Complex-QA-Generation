C.  A person who is a building owner may apply for a certificate of eligibility for the 2021 sustainable building tax credit from the energy, minerals and natural resources department after the construction, installation or renovation of the sustainable building or installation of energy-conserving products in an existing building is complete.  Applications shall be considered in the order received.  If the energy, minerals and natural resources department determines that the building owner meets the requirements of this subsection and that the building with respect to which the application is made meets the requirements of this section for a 2021 sustainable building tax credit, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility to the building owner, subject to the limitations in Subsection D of this section. The certificate shall include the rating system certification level awarded to the building, the amount of qualified occupied square footage in the building, a calculation of the maximum amount of 2021 sustainable building tax credit for which the building owner would be eligible, the identification number, date of issuance and the first taxable year that the credit shall be claimed.  The energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue rules governing the procedure for administering the provisions of this subsection.  If the certification level for the sustainable residential building is awarded on or after January 1, 2022, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility to a building owner who is:

E.  For any taxable year that the energy, minerals and natural resources department determines that applications for sustainable building tax credits for any type of sustainable building pursuant to Subsection D of this section are less than the aggregate limit for that type of sustainable building for that taxable year, the energy, minerals and natural resources department shall allow the difference between the aggregate limit and the applications to be added to the aggregate limit of another type of sustainable building for which applications exceeded the aggregate limit for that taxable year.  Any excess not used in a taxable year shall not be carried forward to subsequent taxable years.  

F.   Installation of a solar thermal system or a photovoltaic system eligible for the new solar market development tax credit pursuant to Section 7-2-18.31 NMSA 1978 shall not be used as a component of qualification for the rating system certification level used in determining eligibility for the 2021 sustainable building tax credit, unless a new solar market development tax credit pursuant to Section 7-2-18.31 NMSA 1978 has not been claimed with respect to that system and the building owner and the taxpayer claiming the 2021 sustainable building tax credit certify that such a tax credit will not be claimed with respect to that system.  

G.  To claim the 2021 sustainable building tax credit, the building owner shall provide to the taxation and revenue department a certificate of eligibility issued by the energy, minerals and natural resources department pursuant to the requirements of Subsection C of this section and any other information the taxation and revenue department may require.  

H.  If the approved amount of a 2021 sustainable building tax credit for a taxpayer in a taxable year represented by a document issued pursuant to Subsection C of this section is:

I.    If the sum of all 2021 sustainable building tax credits that can be applied to a taxable year for a taxpayer, calculated according to Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection H of this section, exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability for that taxable year, the excess may be carried forward for a period of up to seven years; provided that if the taxpayer is a low-income taxpayer, the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer.  

J.   A taxpayer who otherwise qualifies and claims a 2021 sustainable building tax credit with respect to a sustainable building owned by a partnership or other business association of which the taxpayer is a member may claim a credit only in proportion to that taxpayer's interest in the partnership or association.  The total credit claimed in the aggregate by all members of the partnership or association with respect to the sustainable building shall not exceed the amount of the credit that could have been claimed by a sole owner of the property.  

K.  Married individuals who file separate returns for a taxable year in which they could have filed a joint return may each claim only one-half of the 2021 sustainable building tax credit that would have been allowed on a joint return.  

L.   If the requirements of this section have been complied with, the department shall issue to the building owner a document granting a 2021 sustainable building tax credit.  The document shall be numbered for identification and declare its date of issuance and the amount of the tax credit allowed pursuant to this section.  The document may be submitted by the building owner with that taxpayer's income tax return, if applicable, or may be sold, exchanged or otherwise transferred to another taxpayer.  The parties to such a transaction shall notify the department of the sale, exchange or transfer within ten days of the sale, exchange or transfer.  

M.  The department and the energy, minerals and natural resources department shall compile an annual report on the 2021 sustainable building tax credit created pursuant to this section that shall include the number of taxpayers approved to receive the tax credit, the aggregate amount of tax credits approved and any other information necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the tax credit.  The department shall present the report to the revenue stabilization and tax policy committee and the legislative finance committee with an analysis of the effectiveness and cost of the tax credit.
