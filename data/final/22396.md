# The benefits  

Electric-powered technologies offer several key benefits to end users over their internal-combustion counterparts. Some of the benefits of electric technologies can include:  

# Reduced maintenance  

Electric motors have 90 percent fewer moving parts with no engine fluids or hoses significantly reducing time and money spent on maintenance.  

# Lower fuel consumption  

By reducing the reliance on fuel, exposure to fluctuating gasoline prices decreases.

# Less noise  

Electric equipment is much quieter than conventional counterparts which means greater operator awareness for reduced fatigue and increased safety.
