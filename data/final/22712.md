# About the Home Energy Rebates program  

Electrifying your home and/or making it more energy efficient is an investment in your home and a way to make your energy more affordable!  

The Home Energy Rebates program will fund energy efficiency and electrification upgrades for Michiganders, helping to reduce monthly utility costs, reduce energy use and related climate impacts, and enhance comfort and indoor air quality.  

The amount of money available for Home Energy Rebates varies depending on the following factors:  

The household's income,   
Identified energy efficiency upgrades for the home, Estimated energy savings,   
Rebate limits (established by DOE and EGLE),   
The selected upgrades being installed, and   
Total project costs.  

Read the October 29, 2024 press release for more information.  

# How do the rebates work?  

The Home Energy Rebates program consists of two funding sources from the Federal Department of Energy (DOE):  

Home Efficiency Rebates (HOMES, IRA Section 50121) Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR, IRA Section 50122)  

The Home Efficiency Rebate (HOMES) program will provide rebates to reduce the cost of energy-saving whole-home improvements in existing single-family and multifamily buildings. Rebate amounts for the HOMES program will be based on the amount of energy savings that can be achieved through a project, verified by an energy model that is completed by a qualified program contractor.  

The Home Electrification and Appliance (HEAR) program will provide rebates to households installing heat pumps and other efficient equipment to help further electrify their homes. Funding is also available through HEAR for additional qualified improvements including insulation, air sealing, and upgraded electrical panels and wiring.
