# WHATISALEVEL2ELECTRICVEHICLE(EV)CHARGINGSTATION?  

An Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station is the equipment needed to charge an EV, and these charging stations are available today at three different levels - Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. Level 1 EV Charging Stations have the longest charging times while Level 3 Charging Stations have the fastest charging times.  

Level 2 Charging Stations are in the middle with an average total charging time between four and six hours. They require a 208 or 240 volt wall outlet and provide 10 to 60 miles of range per hour of charging time. Individual charging times differ based on the type of EV charging station as well as the type of battery, how depleted it is and its energy capacity.

According to ENERGY STAR@. driving an EV and installing a Level 2 EV Charging Station at home provides savings, convenience and smart technology. For every mile driven, it costs half as much - on average - to drive an EV compared to a standard gasoline-powered vehicle. Some Level 2 EV Charging Stations offer remote power monitoring and control of the charging state of the connected vehicle. When installed at home, Level 2 EV Charging Stations enable an EV owner to leave the house every day at full charge.
