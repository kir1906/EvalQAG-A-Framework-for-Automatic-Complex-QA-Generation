# Instant Discount offerings  

Our Instant Discounts program incentivizes local distributors to stock energy-efficient equipment, making it easier for you to find more energy-saving models in your area and reduce your energy bills and overall carbon footprint. Instant Discounts are only available through participating providers, and the discount is automatically deducted from the purchase price – no paperwork needed. Ask your preferred HVAC contractor if they participate in MidAmerican Energy Instant Discounts or use our provider search tool to find a participating provider in your area. If your contractor is not on our provider list, or you have already installed your new HVAC system, contact us at 877-932-0616.
