 ## Summary : 
 **_Note: The Federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) created the Home Efficiency
Rebates (HER) Program. The IRA established the main parameters for this
program but allowed the states to customize the program to meet their state-
specific needs. The program is designed to provide rebates for whole-home
energy improvements. Actual rebate amounts are determined by the level of
modeled or measured energy savings and the income level of the applicant. See
summary below and program website for complete details._**

**_Georgia’s HER program is now available as a limited pilot and is expected
to fully launch by March 31, 2025. During the pilot program-approved
contractors will use their existing client base to deliver savings to eligible
households._**

Georgia’s HER program helps households finance whole-home energy efficiency
retrofits and upgrades. The incentives are based on a household’s area median
income and the amount of energy savings as a result of the upgrades.
