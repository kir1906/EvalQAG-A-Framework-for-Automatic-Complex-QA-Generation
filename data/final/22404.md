# Get your rebate!  

If a participating dealership applied your rebate as a discount when you got your vehicle, you’re all set!  

Otherwise, fill out this simple online form. You’ll need some key pieces of info (listed below) and an online GMP account. You can easily create one if you don’t have one!  

Also, when you’re getting an AEV (new or used), we’ll give you a Level 2 charger to install at home and use while you’re a GMP customer participating in our home charging program! This makes it super convenient to charge up, and you’re then eligible to sign up for one of our discount EV charging rates to help you save even more!  

We are here to help! Schedule time with a GMP EV Expert to answer your questions and get more information about electric vehicles and rebates.
