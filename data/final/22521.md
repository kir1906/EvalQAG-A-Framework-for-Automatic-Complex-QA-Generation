# Electric Vehicle Incentive Programs  

New Jersey is leading the way on electric vehicle (EV) adoption on the East Coast. Governor Phil Murphy has set a goal of registering 330,000 EVs in New Jersey by 2025, which will reduce emissions from the transportation sector and help reach the goals of New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan and the Global Warming Response Act. The transportation sector accounts for $46\%$ of the state’s net greenhouse gas emissions, making it the largest emissions source.

# Charge Up New Jersey  

On January 17, 2020, Governor Murphy signed S-2252 into law (P.L.2019, c.362), which created an incentive program for light-duty electric vehicles and at-home electric charging infrastructure. Charge Up New Jersey promotes clean vehicle adoption in the state by offering incentives of up to $\$4,000$ for the purchase or lease of new, eligible zero-emission vehicles, including battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric. By shifting away from gasoline and diesel use, it creates many environmental and economic benefits, including less air pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

# Tax Credits Available through the IRA Direct Pay Program  

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) aims to promote consumer savings and provides opportunities for commercial entities to benefit from energy and financial savings for investing in energy efficiency technologies.  

Tax-exempt organizations can use the IRA’s Direct Pay Program to take advantage of tax credits by implementing clean energy projects.  These projects include electric vehicles (EV), EV chargers, renewables, and other similar initiatives. This program is a valuable opportunity for municipalities, schools, and non-profits to kickstart their efforts toward achieving clean energy goals.  

To file for Direct Pay, the organization must pre-register and submit the required documents to the IRS. For additional details and resources, visit Sustainable Jersey.

# Utility Programs  

Certain EV charging stations that receive electric utility service from Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE), Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G), Rockland Electric Company (RECO) or Jersey Central Power and Light (JCP&L), may be eligible for additional electric vehicle charging incentives directly from the utility. Projects may be eligible for both the incentives offered by this BPU program and incentives offered by ACE, PSE&G, RECO or JCP&L, up to $90\%$ of the combined charger purchase and installation costs. Please check ACE, PSE&G, RECO or JCP&L program eligibility requirements before purchasing EV charging equipment, as additional conditions on types of eligible chargers may apply for utility incentives.  

EV Charging incentive information is available from Atlantic City Electric, PSE&G, RECO and JCP&L.

# NJBPU Moves to Increase Electric Vehicle Infrastructure in New Jersey  

In September, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) approved an Order setting parameters for the build-out of publicly accessible, light-duty electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in the State and the role of private and public investment in developing the infrastructure. The Order establishes minimum filing requirements for light-duty EV infrastructure proposals from New Jersey’s electric utilities and requires them, if they have not done so already, to submit these filings by February 28, 2021.  

NJBPU had released a Straw Proposal in May that was aimed at furthering light-duty EV adoption in New Jersey. Comments received from stakeholders on this straw proposal can be found here.  The Straw Proposal can be found here.  A recording of the stakeholder meeting about the proposal is available here, and the panel presentations from the meeting can be found below:  

How to best expand the Electric Vehicle Service Equipment (EVSE) Infrastructure and encourage Charger Ready investment   
How to ensure equity in the EV Ecosystem   
How to design and integrate EV charging into the rate structure  

In June 2021, NJBPU released a Straw Proposal aimed at furthering medium and heavy duty EV adoption and EV light duty fleets in New Jersey. Comments received from stakeholders on this straw proposal can be found here. Recordings of the stakeholder meeting about the proposal and panel presentations from the meetings can be found here as part of the September 15, 2021 Notice.  

A revised Straw Proposal was released in December 2022.
