# Arkansas NEVI Formula Funding Program  

Arkansas Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan  

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program is a $\$5$ billion program established by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) to build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations by 2030 along federally designated Alternative Fuel Corridors (AFCs). NEVI will provide funding to state governments over the next five years to strategically deploy Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) charging station infrastructure and increase access to charging stations for Americans to travel across states and nationwide in EVs.
