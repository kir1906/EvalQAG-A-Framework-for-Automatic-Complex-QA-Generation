The Energy Bureau may require PREPA to provide additional information as needed to meet the requirements. In the event a resubmission is required by the Energy Bureau, PREPA shall submit the revised Annual Report subject to the terms of the Energy Bureau's order.  

# ARTICLE 3. ENERGY EFFICIENCY SAVINGS TARGETS  

Section 3.01 Targets  

A) The 2040 target for Annual Cumulative Reduction in electric consumption resulting from increased energy efficiency shall be 4,744 GWh per year (30% of PREPA's fiscal year2019 sales).  

B) The target may be achieved through multiple means and Contributing Entities, including, but not limited to:  

1)  PREPA-run or PREPA-facilitated energy efficiency programs; 2) Energy efficiency programs and actions in governmental buildings; 3) Savings resulting from the adoption of new building energy codes implemented after 2019, or increased compliance with building energy codes; 4) Savings resulting from incremental federal or Commonwealth appliance energy efficiency standards and laws implemented after 2019; 5) Energy efficiency in non-governmental buildings resulting from actions funded by federal or Commonwealth governmental funds, such as low-income weatherization programs, Community Development Block Grants, disaster recovery or hazard mitigation funds, or other such programs; and 6) Other sources as the Energy Bureau may identify and include in its assessment of progress.   
C) The Energy Bureau shall measure progress toward the statutory target of 30% energy efficiency by 2040 from sources as identified in (B)(1)-(6) of this section and publicly report on that progress annually by posting a report on its webpage.   
D) The Energy Bureau shall establish, as part of each approved Three-Year Energy Efficiency Plan described in Section 4.02 of this Regulation, the annual energy savings it expects to be achieved from sources identified in (B)(1)-(6) of this section for each Program Year until 2040.   
E) To establish energy efficiency savings targets for PREPA, the Energy Bureau, in collaboration with the PEPP, shall estimate the contribution of energy savings expected to come from actions identified in (B)(2)-(6) of this section for each Program Year, including estimates for each year through 2040. This determination should be informed by information available to the Energy Bureau and the PEPP, including but not limited to historic performance, Market Baseline Studies and Potential Studies. The Energy Bureau shall assign the remainder of the required energy efficiency savings target for each Program Year to PREPA.   
F)  The allocations among the sources as identified in (B)(1)-(6) of this section shall be reviewed as part of the Three-Year Plan cycle described in Section 4.02 of this Regulation and, if necessary, modified.  

# artion 2 02 Fnarov Efficiencv Studies  

A) No later than four (4) months after the effective date of this Regulation, and triennially as needed, the Energy Bureau shall contract with expert consultants to  

![](images/57e9a462714b434085af3978be1dc1f48f24d15f2fb330cd69dde9ef0d0b6dde.jpg)  

conduct a Market Baseline Study. The consultant shall be responsible for gathering the necessary data to estimate the contributions from all Contributing Entities toward the types of efficiency resources listed in paragraph (B)(1)-(6) of Section 3.01 of this Regulation.   
B) No later than four (4) months after the completion of the development of the Puerto Rico Test as described in Section 5.02 of this Regulation, and triennially as needed, the Energy Bureau shall contract with expert consultants to conduct a Potential Study to quantify the achieved (in the past) and expected (in the future) savings resulting from PREPA and other Contributing Entities listed in paragraphs (B)(2)-(6) of Section 3.01 of this Regulation, as well as the cost-effective potential for energy efficiency in Puerto Rico.   
C) The Energy Bureau may delegate to PREPA the responsibility for contracting with expert consultants to conduct a Market Baseline Study and/or Potential Study.   
D) Prior to the end of the Transition Period Plan, and informed by the first Potential Study, the Energy Bureau shall estimate the energy efficiency savings achieved during that period from actions listed in paragraphs (B)(2)-(6) of Section 3.01 of this Regulation.   
E) The Energy Bureau shall use the results of the initial Market Baseline Study and the Potential Study, along with the estimated impacts of actions during the Transition Period Plan, to develop, in collaboration with PEPP, estimated annual savings expected to be achieved by PREPA's efficiency programs and the actions of other Contributing Entities (as identified in paragraphs (B)(2)-(6) of Section 3.01 of this Regulation) for each Program Year through 2040.   
F)  The Energy Bureau shall revisit and may amend these annual savings expectations in the course of each Three-Year Energy Efficiency Plan process contained in Section 4.02 of this Regulation, informed by the progress achieved to date, any subsequent Market Baseline or Potential Studies, any intervening IRP process, and expected nonÂ· utility efficiency programs or actions. G) Within the course of each Three-Year Energy Efficiency Plan process contained in Section 4.02, PREPA may propose energy efficiency programs that seek to obtair energy efficiency savings from actions identified in paragraphs (B)(3)-(4) of Sectior 3.01 of this Regulation. PREPA must prove that any projected energy efficiency savings are directly attributable to its actions through an evaluation study. If these  

programs are approved by the Energy Bureau, the Energy Bureau shall adjust tht allocation of expected energy savings accordingly to include the anticipated savings and ensure that savings are not double-counted.
