**Level II Electric Vehicle Charge Stations**

Level 2 charging uses 240 volt power to enable faster regeneration of an EV’s
battery system. Providing this type of charging requires installation of an
EVSE unit and electrical wiring capable of handling higher voltage power.
Plug-in America’s PlugStar tools offer a listing of Level 2 EVSE currently on
the market. Many utilities are offering free level 2 charging equipment and/or
incentives with an electric car purchase. These stations provide fast charge
times of 10 - 20 miles of range per hour of charge and about 3% more energy
efficiency than level 1 stations. These systems are more expensive than level
1 stations and may have a potentially higher impact on peak kilowatt demand
charges for businesses.
