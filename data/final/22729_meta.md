 ## Summary : 
 **_Note: The Federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) created the Home
Electrification and Appliance Rebate (HEAR) Program. The IRA established the
main parameters for this program, but allowed the states to customize the
program to meet their state-specific needs. The program is designed to award
rebates for purchase of qualifying home electrification equipment and
appliances. Residents earning less than 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI)
can receive the full rebate amount, and residents earning between 80% and 150%
AMI can receive a partial rebate. See summary below and program website for
complete details._**

Wisconsin's HEAR program is administered by Focus on Energy, the state's
utility-led energy efficiency provider.
