 ## Summary : 
 **_Note:[The Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf#page=993)
created the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/) with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

The Utah Department of Transportation’s (UDOT) [NEVI
plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14_75QZLWVUaM-zmfB5N5MjqkA_SfUwwT/view)
includes achieving build out status along the state's AFCs including I-15,
I-70, I-80, I-84, I-215, and portions of US-6 and US-191.The state also plans
to identify and begin building high-priority corridors that provide access to
Utah’s five National Parks, forty-two State Parks, and other places of
interest. Utah plans to use a blend of contracting approaches to complete the
projects. An [updated
plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wooPjEBqLma8hXYF9U-nVZF31qzZri_7/view)
was published in August 2023. Much of the plan remains the same with most of
the updates being in response to the newly issued NEVI Standards and
Requirements 23 CFR 680. In December 2023, UDOT published a list of recipients
who have received conditional awards for the RFA -Phase 1.
