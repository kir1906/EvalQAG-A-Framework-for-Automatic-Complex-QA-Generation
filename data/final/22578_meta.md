 ## Summary : 
 [H.F.
2310](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=HF2310&type=bill&version=4&session=ls93&session_year=2023&session_number=0),
enacted in May 2023 (see section 216C.375), created the Solar for Schools
grant program under the Minnesota Department of Commerce.  

The Program allows schools and parties on the behalf of schools to apply for
grants for up to 100% of the cost of procuring and installing a solar energy
generation system on or adjacent to the school premises. The law directed a
$14,310,000 budget allocation to support the program.

The Department of Commerce is directed to request applications from interested
schools, utilities, and developers and assess the applications and ensure that
all costs are necessary and reasonable. The amount of the grant amount awarded
must be based on the Commissioner's assessment of the school's need for
financial assistance.  

The program provides grants for systems up to 40 kW or up to 1,000 kW with the
consent of the utility servicing the school.
