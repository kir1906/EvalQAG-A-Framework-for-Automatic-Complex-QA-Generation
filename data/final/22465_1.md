GENERAL ORDER 09-19-2019  

Docket No. R-33929, In re: Review of Policies Related to Customer-Owned Solar Generation and Possible Modification of the Commission's Current Net Metering Rules.  

(Decided at the September 11, 2019 Business and Executive Session.)  

# Background andProcedural History  

At the December 2015 Business and Executive Session (\*"B&E"), the Louisiana Public Service Commission ("LPSC" or the “"Commission") approved a proposal for Staff to conduct a two-phase rulemaking designed to: 1) modify the Commission's then current net metering Rule in order to address how new solar customers should be compensated once a utility reaches the net metering cap found in 85.02 of the Rule (on an expedited basis); and 2) examine appropriate changes to solar policies in Louisiana on a longer-term comprehensive basis.  

The rulemaking docket was published in the Commission's Official Bulletin dated December 29, 2015. Along with the Official Bulletin publication, Staff proposed Phase I modifications to the Commission's net metering Rule designed to address issues related to postcap remuneration, and specifically recognizing the need and opportunity for further changes to the Commission's net metering Rule in Phase I. Interventions were received from: Association of Louisiana Electric Cooperatives ("ALEC"), the Louisiana Energy Users Group ("LEUG"), the NRG Companies ("NRG"), Cleco Power LLC ("Cleco Power"), Southwestern Electric Power Company ("SWEPCO"), Southwest Louisiana Electric Membership Corporation ("SLEMCO"), Marathon Petroleum Company, LP. ("Marathon"), Entergy Louisiana, LLC ("Entergy” or “ELL"), Gulf States Renewable Energy Industries Association ("GSREIA"), Alliance for Affordable Energy ("AAE"), PosiGen of Louisiana, LLC ("PosiGen"), Dixie Electric Membership Corporation ("DEMCO"), the Sierra Club ("Sierra Club"), South Coast Solar, LLC ("South Coast"), Wilhite Energy, LLC (\*"Wilhite"), and Energy Freedom Coalition of America, LLC. A late filed Motion for Intervention was filed by Walmart Louisiana LLC and Sam's East, Inc. (collectively \*Walmart"), which was granted.  

Upon consideration of the parties' comments to proposed Phase I rulemaking modifications, Staff filed its recommendation into the record on April 15, 2016. The Commission ultimately accepted Staff's proposed recommendation at its November 17, 2016 B&E, memorializing the Commission's decision in General Order dated December 8, 2016. At its December 21, 2016 B&E, the Commission directed Staff to move forward with Phase II of the rulemaking. At its January 18, 2017 B&E, the Commission issued a directive regarding the completion of a consultant's report and directed Staffto file a request for comments from interested parties. Staff filed its initial request for comments on January 20, 2017. In its request, Staff sought written comments to assist in its determination of whether a more effective approach to supporting existing and facilitating new behind-the-meter, or distributed generation, could be developed. Staff also allowed any party to provide additional comments that would assist the Commission in adopting rules that would be fair, reasonable, enforceable and not burdensome, and that could adapt to industry changes as necessary. Comments were filed by ELL, Sierra Club, ALEC, SWEPCO, GSREIA, Posigen, and AAE. On November 28, 2017, Staff issued a Phase II Notice of Proposed Modified Rules and Request for Comments. Comments were submitted on behalf of Wilhite, Cleco Power, Posigen, Walmart, ELL, ALEC, Sierra Club, AAE, and GSREIA. After review of all the comments filed, the Notice of Staff Recommendation on Final Proposed Rule was issued on January 8, 2019, which contained a thorough discussion of all comments received from Intervenors in Phase II, and an analysis in support of Staff's Final Proposed Rule. Subsequent to filing Staff's Final Proposed Rule, Staff filed a Proposed Settlement into the record on September 4, 2019, which is discussed more fully below, in an effort to resolve all issues in this docket.  

# Jurisdiction andApplicableLaw  

The Commission has been vested with plenary authority to regulate public utilities and common carriers and exercises jurisdiction in this proceeding pursuant to Article IV, Section 21(B) of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974, which provides in pertinent part:  

The commission shall regulate all common carriers and public utilities and have such other regulatory authority as provided by law.It shall adopt and enforce reasonable rules, regulations, and procedures necessary for the discharge ofits duties,and shallhave other powersandperform other dutiesasprovidedbylaw.  

# Staff's Analysis and Recommendation  

During the last several years that this proceeding has been ongoing, all interested parties and stakeholders were invited, and in fact encouraged to submit comments explaining their positions and help inform a proposed rule to be developed by the Staff. In all, and not considering the comments on the Staffs recent settlement proposal, almost 40 comments were received from industry stakeholders. The Final Proposed Rule recommended some changes to the existing NetMetering rules. It recommended elimination of the 0.5% cap on solar users. It recommended twochannel metering and billing. It proposed the payment of avoided cost, based upon Locational Marginal Prices, for excess power produced and sold to the utility, except that it recommended a five-year grandfathering provision, under which any entity with a solar facility installed prior to issuance of the order would be paid full retail rates for excess power sold to the utility under twochannel metering. In addition, the Final Proposed Rule would not allow the grandfathering to continue if ownership of the property is transferred, would allow Renewable Energy Credits ("RECs") to be eligible for use only in Louisiana, would cap the maximum size of a commercial solar facility at 300 kW, and it did not provide for a reevaluation by the Commission at the end of the five-year grandfathering period.  

The Commission has an overriding obligation, stemming from its Constitutional authority, to ensure that all Louisiana ratepayers receive safe, reliable service at the lowest reasonable cost. In fulfillment of that obligation, the Commission must ensure that electric service providers, both investor-owned utilities and distribution cooperatives, find and utilize the lowest cost sources of electricity to satisfy their public utility obligation to serve their loads. This term, by definition, is known as Avoided Cost and the markets of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator or the Southwest Power Pool set that avoided cost in a completely transparent manner. To the extent that the solar customers are paid any more than avoided costs for the energy they produce and sell to the utility, all of the non-solar customers must make up the difference. For example, last year avoided cost on the ELL system was about 3.5g/kWh and the full retail rate on average was about 9.3g/kWh. The approximate 6.0g/kWh above avoided cost paid to solar customers had to be paid by the rest of ELL's ratepayers who do not have solar. That subsidy results in approximately \$2,00o,000 annually for all Louisiana electric utilities combined. To the extent that the Commission grandfathers existing rates for solar customers, this subsidy will continue until the end of the grandfathering period.  

The evidence and analysis contained in Staff's Final Proposed Rule, issued and filed in the record on January 8, 2019, fully supports Staff's original recommendation of a 5-year grandfathering, effective upon issuance of a Commission Order in this Docket, with no transferability of the grandfathering if the house or business is sold. Subsidization would have continued for an additional 5 years and the buyer of a home or business with existing solar had no expectation that payment at full retail rates would continue.  

# Staff'sProposedStipulatedSettlement  

After issuing the Final Proposed Rule, Staff met and spoke with individual stakeholders on several occasions and received feedback to that Proposed Rule. On August 14, 2019, Staff issued a Notice of Settlement Conference to all Intervenors in this docket. That Settlement Conference was established to discuss potential alternatives to the Final Proposed Rule. Prior to that Settlement Conference, Staff circulated to all Intervenors a confidential proposal to resolve all of the issues in this docket, and it provided a dial-in for those Intervenors that were not able to attend the Settlement Conference in person. That settlement proposal included a potential extension of the grandfathering period to fifteen years. The Settlement Conference was held on August 21, 2019. Discussions were held regarding the Staff setlement proposal, and feedback was received from the parties in attendance. At the end of that Settlement Conference, there was no agreement reached to consensually resolve the issues in this docket. Instead, it was agreed that any Intervenor was invited to comment on Staff's proposal in writing or offer alternative proposals in writing by the close of business on August 28, 2019. Comments were submitted by Cleco Power, SWEPCO, ELL, ALEC, AAE and Sierra Club (jointly), Posigen, and GSREIA. Those comments contained a wide variety of views on the Staff's proposal as well as a number of requests for clarification.  

Notwithstanding the evidence supporting the Final Proposed Rule, both Staff and the Commission carefully considered the arguments made by the Intervenors, which resulted in Staff proposing a modified proposal to: extend the grandfathering from 5 to 15 years; permit purchasers of homes and businesses with grandfathered facilities to take advantage of the remaining grandfathered period; permit the solar owners to retain ownership of their renewable energy credits; and establish an "Avoided Cost" only once a year and have that avoided cost publicly and transparently posted on both the Electric Utility and Commission websites. These proposed changes are fair, and even generous, to solar customers and will ensure that existing solar customers have an opportunity to recover their investment in solar, while establishing an end date to thesubsidizationbynon-solar customers.  

While issuing the proposed settlement, Staff maintained the reasonableness of the Final Proposed Rule issued on January 8, 2019, including that the Final Proposed Rule was drafted in a manner designed to appropriately balance the costs and benefits associated with solar production by electric ratepayers; protects the interests of both solar and non-solar customers; ensures that safe, reliable electric service continues to be delivered to all Louisiana ratepayers at the lowest reasonable cost; and is in the public interest. However, after review and due consideration of the comments and settlement proposals received, and in an effort to resolve all issues in this docket, Staff recommended that the Final Proposed Rule be adopted by the Commission, except as modified by thefollowing terms:  

1) The $0.5\%$ cap on solarusers shall be eliminated;   
2) All customers who have both submitted a complete interconnection request and completed installation of a DistributedGenerationFacilityby12/31/19shallpay thefull retail ratefor all the energypurchasedfrom the utility,shall pay a zero rate for all energy self-generated and consumed, and shall be credited at full retail rates for the energy sold back to the utility through 12/31/2034 (i.e., a 15-year grandfathered period). This includes all current solar customers who presently do not receive full retail rates for energy sold back to the utility due to the now repealed 0.5% cap. After 12/31/2034, these grandfathered customers shall pay the full retail rate for all the energy purchased from the utility shall pay a zero rate for all energy self-generated and consumed, and be credited at avoided cost for all energy sold back to the utility.  

3) All customers who submit an interconnection request and/or install a Distributed Generation Facility after 12/31/19 shall pay the full retail rate for all the energy purchased from the utility, shall pay a zero rate for all energy self-generated and consumed, and be credited at Avoided Cost for the energy sold back to the utility.  

4) "Avoided Cost" shall be calculated as the 12-month average Locational Marginal Price for each LPSC-jurisdictional Electric Utility. The Avoided Cost rate will be updated annually by each LPSC-jurisdictional Electric Utility in their annual filing pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Distributed Generation Rule, and the calculation of Avoided Cost will be the 12-month average for the prior calendar year of the Locational Marginal  Price associated  with the  LPSC-jurisdictional Electric Utility's load zone in the applicable Independent System Operator market: the Midcontinent Independent System Operator or the Southwest Power Pool  

5) At the end of the Billing Period, if the value of the electricity generated by the Distributed Generation Facility exceeds the cost of the electricity supplied by the Electric Utility to the Distributed Generation Customer, subject to the applicable rate schedule, the Distributed Generation Customer's monthly bill shall be credited, on the next Billing Period, for the monetary value of the excess distributed generation as defined in Section 4.1.2 of the Rule.  

6) The avoided cost rate for each LPSC-jurisdictional Electric Utility shall be posted on the Electric Utility's website and the Avoided Cost rates for all LPSCjurisdictional Electric Utilities shall be posted on the LPsC's website.  

7)If asolarfacilty is subject tograndfathering, that grandfathering continues through 12/31/2034 even if the property is sold.   
8) Louisiana Electric Utilities will be required to consider developing tariffs for community distributed generation, subject to LPSC approval.   
9) There will be a 30-day review period for residential Distributed Generation applications and a 45-day review period for commercial or community Distributed Generation applications. However, utilities will utilize their best efforts to complete the review of residential distributed generation applications within 14 days.   
10) The owners of the solar facilities retain ownership of the Renewable Energy Credits, and will have the option to retain or transfer those credits upon the sale of the property housing the solar facilities. However, a utility may in a Distributed Generation tariff filing, subject to the approval of the Commission, request the opportunity to offer to purchase RECs from REC owners interested in relinquishing their REC ownership.   
11) Requests for approval of multiple systems greater than 300 kW in a single filing will be permitted.   
12） Section 4.1.3.1 as contained in the Staff's proposed tariff will be amended as follows: "If the Distributed Generation Customer has multiple service accounts with the Electric Utility, the Distributed Generation Customer may elect, after notifying the Electric Utility and subject to Commission review if disputed by the Electric Utility,toapply credits pursuant toSection4.1.3 to any otherligible mter at the same physical location, provided that the conditions identified in Section 4.5 are not applicable."   
13) There will be an automatic re-evaluation of the Rule at the end of the grandfathering period or earlier if directedby the Commission.   
14） The Settlement Terms and Proposed Rules shall be applied on a prospective basis only, without any true-up of net meter customers that were credited/compensated for excess net metered energy at the Electric Utility's avoided cost rate during the interim period from when the utility met the 0.5% cap pursuant to Section 5.02 of the Commission's current net metering rules (Attachment “A" to LPSC General Order No. 12-8-2016 (R-33929) to the effective date of the Rules.   
15)All amounts credited/compensated to customers for excess net metered energy exported to the electric utility, whether at Avoided Cost or full retail rates, shall continue to be eligible for recovery by the utility pursuant to Commission General Order No. U-21497 (11-6-1997), which governs the types of costs that may be recovered through a utility's monthly Fuel Adjustment Clause (see Section 6.2.1.4 of the Proposed Rules).  

Existing solar customers receive a total benefit of about \$819 per year by receiving full retail rates both for the energy they produce and consume and for the energy they sell to the utility. This is approximately \$15,000,000 in total savings per year for existing solar customers. This will continue until January 1, 2035. Solar customers who install and/or interconnect after December 31, 2019 will still receive full retail credit for the energy they produce and consume, which,on average,is $80\%$ of all energy produced by solar customers. It is only the remaining 20% produced by these new customers and sold to the utilities that will be priced at avoided cost. On average, new solar customers will receive benefits of about $\$700$ per year.Adoption of Staff's recommendation, as modified by the Proposed Settlement filed September 4, 2019, results in a fair and appropriate balancing of interests, gives solar customers significant benefits, and provides certainty going forward.  

# Commission Consideration  

This matter was considered at the Commission's September 11, 2019 Business and Executive Session. After discussion and hearing from numerous individuals, Commissioner Boissiere made a motion, seconded by Vice Chairman Campbell, to maintain Staff's recommendation except to remove 2-Channel Billing and to extend the deadline for grandfathering eligibility to December 31, 2020. This motion was opposed by Chairman Francis, Commissioner Skrmetta, and Commissioner Greene. The motion failed 3:2. Chairman Francis then made the followingmotion:  

I want to thank all who provided comments today. After months of constituent and stakeholder meetings as well as discussions with Staff on what is a reasonable balance between solar customers and non-solar customers and the costs and benefits associated with solar production by electric ratepayers, I believe the Staff's Settlement Proposal strikes that reasonable balance. Solar customers will continue to enjoy full retail price benefits for all solar energy they consume. All solar customers with solar facilities completed and a complete interconnection request submitted by December 31, 2019 will be paid full retail price for all energy in excess of that consumed that is sold back to the utility until December 31, 2034. This includes all customers who had facilities installed after the .5 percent cap under the current rules was reached. Therefore, all of those solar customers will have at least 15 years, and most will have more than 15 years to help recover their investment in their solar arrays. Those customers who install solar after the grandfather deadline, and all customers after December 31, 2034, will enjoy full retail price benefits for solar energy they consume, and will be paid the utility's avoided cost, which is the wholesale value, of that excess production. This will provide a fair but limited fixed period and a fixed number of solar customers that will require subsidies for excess energy sold back to the grid. Therefore, I move that we accept Staff's recommendation to adopt Staff's Settlement Proposal filed into the record on September 4, 2019.  

Commissioner Greene seconded the motion, with Commissioner Skrmetta concurring, and Vice Chairman Campbell and Commissioner Boissiere opposing, the motion passed.  

# IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED THAT:  

1) Staff's Recommendation filed into the record September 4, 2019 is hereby adopted with the modifications described in this order, including the revised rules attached hereto as ExhibitA.   
2)This Order is effective immediately.
