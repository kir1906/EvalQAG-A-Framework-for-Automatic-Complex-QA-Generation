# Learn About Community Solar  

The Board is pleased to announce that it has launched the Community Solar Project Finder to connect interested customers with community solar projects that serve their area. Developed in partnership with Sustainable Jersey, the Project Finder allows residents to search by ZIP code to view projects that are currently seeking subscribers.

# Consolidated Billing  

New Jersey’s Community Solar Energy Program now offers consolidated billing with all four electric distribution companies. Subscribers will now see their community solar subscription charges on their electric bills and will no longer receive separate bills from their subscriber organizations (community solar providers). Your regular monthly electric bill will show your normal electric usage and charges, your community solar kWh allocation and bill credit received from your community solar subscription, and the discounted subscription charge. The subscription charge will always be less than the bill credit, resulting in guaranteed savings!  

For example, if you receive \$50 in bill credits and your provider offers a $20\%$ discount, you will see a community solar charge amount of \$40, resulting in a net savings on your bill of \$10.  

The utilities also provide information about community solar to their customers: PSE&G, JCP&L, and Atlantic City Electric.  

For subscriber organizations, each utility has a consolidated billing manual with instructions for setting up a project account and processing subscriber allocation lists: PSE&G, JCP&L (Q&A), Atlantic City Electric, and Rockland Electric.
