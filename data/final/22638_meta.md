 ## Summary : 
 The Massachusetts Department of Transportation (DOT) will follow a two-stage
approach for the deployment of NEVI funding. Funds will first be used to
eliminate any gaps in the state's EV AFC network and will then be used to
focus on network zones where there are the most demand or high-priority zones
with the highest share of environmental justice communities. NEVI funding will
help construct about 851 miles of EV charging corridors. NEVI funding will
also complete the implementation of a program to support an electric "vehicles
for hire" fleet and for developing a municipal building code requiring make-
ready charging in all new commercial and residential buildings. MassDOT is in
the process of transitioning its NEVI [plan
](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/ev_deployment_plans/ma_nevi_plan.pdf)from
planning to the implementation stage, which includes contracting with a
private entity to handle the deployment of said plan. In early October 2023,
the agency sent a letter to the Federal Highway Administration indicating
their transition to the implementation stage and that they do not anticipate
making significant changes to the plan soon and issued its [updated
](https://www.mass.gov/doc/dm-letter-to-fhwa/download)plan per NEVI
procedures.
