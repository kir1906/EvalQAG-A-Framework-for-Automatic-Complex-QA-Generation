 ## Summary : 
 [S.B.
2499A](https://webserver.rilegislature.gov/BillText/BillText24/SenateText24/S2499A.pdf),
enacted in June 2024, established an energy storage procurement target with
the following goals:

  * 90 MW by December 31, 2026 
  * 195 MW by December 31, 2028
  * 600 MW by December 31, 2033

The bill authorized the Rhode Island infrastructure bank, in consultation with
the Office of Energy Resources, to develop one or more programs to meet the
energy storage procurement goals. Any such programs should target
installations by residential classes of electric customers, low-income
residential classes of electric customers, commercial classes of electric
customers, energy storage systems connected to the distribution or
transmission system in front of the meter and not associated with a customerâ€™s
electric load.
