# Power Your Drive provides low-cost EV charging stations  

Did you know transportation accounts for $55\%$ of all the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) in the City of San Diego? SDG&E is a key partner in local efforts to help reduce GHGs and we're on a mission to help San Diego make the switch to electric vehicles. One of our completed projects is Power Your Drive which makes EV charging stations more accessible to apartment and condo dwellers, and workplace employees. Power Your Drive is fully subscribed at this time.  

The Power Your Drive Pilot program installed over 3,000 charging stations at 255 locations. Between 2020 and 2023, Power Your Drive participants that charged at PYD stations reduced greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 15,0o0 metric tons. That eliminated the combustion of 1.6 million gallons of gasoline and is the equivalent of over 40 million electric vehicle miles driven.  

Driving electric has never been easier (/node/50).
