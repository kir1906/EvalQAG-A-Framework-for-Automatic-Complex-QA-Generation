# Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure  

# Nevada's Alternative Fueling Infrastructure Plan for Electric Vehicle Infrastructure  

# Overview  

As a result of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) National Electrical Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, over the next five years, the Nevada Department of Transportation will receive $\$38$ million to support publicly accessible electric vehicle (EV) charging. The goal of this program is to create a national network of charging stations.  

The NDOT Alternative Fueling Infrastructure Plan, also known as the NDOT NEVI plan, is Nevada's plan to spend this $\$38$ million.  

# How Federal Funding Will Be Used  

Under the NEVI guidelines, initial funding prioritizes interstate highways. Interstate Highways are designated as Alternative Fuel Corridors (AFC). The goal for Nevada is to achieve “Fully Built-Out” status along these AFCs. With some exceptions, this generally means that travelers can expect to find a fast-charging station every 50 miles in close proximity to the interstate. The list below illustrates the specific NEVI requirements.  

# Phase 1 NEVI Station Criteria  

One mile from the highway   
50 miles between stations   
DC fast charging stations with at least four ports with CCS connector   
Power output of at least 150kW per port  

After completing work on the AFC's, NDOT will enter into the next phase of prioritization and funding will be available for more locations and purposes.  

# Timeline  

On September 14, 2022, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approved the Nevada Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Plan (available here). For the first year of funding (FY 2023), NDOT focused on coordinating with NV Energy and Wells Rural Electric to deploy EV infrastructure along the state's Alternative Fuel Corridors in their service territories.  

On September 29, 2023, FHWA approved NDOT's Plan Update for FY 2024 (available here). For the second year (FY 2024), NDOT will continue its partnership with NV Energy and rural electric companies to advance the proposed sites along interstates. Other potential sites along Alternative Fuel Corridors will also be identified. More details on the site selection process can be found here.  

On November 15, 2024, FHWA approved NDOT's Plan Update for FY 2025,these plan updates can be viewed here.  

With a focus on collaboration and coordination to serve all of Nevada with a data-driven approach to planning, this plan will be updated annually through FY 2027.

# Grant Opportunity  

The Federal Highway Administration is offering a second opportunity to apply for funds for publicly accessible electric vehicle charging and alternative fueling infrastructure. This Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program (CFI) is a competitive grant program to strategically deploy publicly accessible electric vehicle charging and alternative https://www.dot.nv.gov/mobility/alternative-fueling-infrastructure-plan 2/6  

fueling infrastructure in the places people live and work.  

Eligible applicants include:  

States or political subdivision of States   
Metropolitan planning organizations   
Unit of local governments   
Special purpose districts or public authorities with a transportation function, including port authorities   
Indian Tribes   
U.S. Territories   
Authorities, agencies, or instrumentalities or entities owned by, one or more entities listed above   
Group of entities listed above   
State or local authorities with ownership of publicly accessible transportation facilities (applies to Com only)  

New Round 2 applications are due by August 28, 2024. Notice requesting reconsideration of past applications is due to FHWA by July 1, 2024.

# Get Involved  

NDOT would like your input to ensure new EV charging stations are equitably deployed and meet the needs of Nevada’s current and future EV drivers, businesses, and communities.  

# NEVI Program Partnering Directory  

NDOT is compiling a list of partners that includes prospective applicants, hosting communities, and other relevant stakeholders who express their desire to install, own, operate, and maintain electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) in their respective communities. This directory will enable charging providers to seek out possible collaborations and remain  

informed about forthcoming program announcements. If you are interested in being included on this list, please fill out the linked Google form below.

# Provide Input on Station Locations:  

NDOT is partnering with NV Energy to seek public input on where EV charging should be located. Whether you are an NV Energy customer or not, whether you live in Nevada or are just visiting, we invite you to add your input to NV Energy's mapping tool by clicking here.  

# Provide Input on NV Energy's Transportation Electrification Plan:  

NV Energy's Stakeholder Survey seeks feedback from interested stakeholders as they develop their Transportation Electrification Plan to accelerate the use of electricity as the transportation fuel of choice.  

Click here for the Stakeholder Survey  

The Resident Survey asks about your preferred vehicle type and features, charging availability, current barriers to owning an EV and opinions of NV Energy's clean energy programs. Your responses will help shape future programming and customer education options.
