 ## Summary : 
 Duke Energy's EV Charger Prep Program provides an incentive to help
residential, commercial, and multifamily customers install EV chargers. The
program provides an incentive for the costs associated with the make-ready
work including underground boring, installing conduit and electric panel work;
not the actual charger. The exact incentive varies depending on the usage of
the charger(s), the number of chargers, the nameplate capacity of the
charger(s), and whether the customer's site needs upgrades required by Duke
Energy, or is receiving new service from Duke.
