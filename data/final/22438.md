# Your business’s solar incentive is $\$0.08/k W h$  

Incentives require pre-approval and projects must complete construction and Measurement & Verification Requirements by May 31, 2026. Incentives are capped at $50\%$ of the project cost, up to $\$500,000$ . All solar projects should be efficiently designed to meet a minimum TRC (Total Resource Cost) score of 0.85. All solar project incentives will be calculated and paid based on energy usage displaced from PPL Electric Utilities’ system. Customers without kWh load offset by solar are not eligible for incentives. To receive pre-approval, you must have a service and interconnection application submitted and a signed IIR with PPL Electric Utilities. For assistance, reach out to Businessaccounts@pplweb.com. New construction projects will be vetted based on the PPL Electric Utilities service application. TRC and incentives will be calculated based on the customer’s displaced energy.

# Frequently asked questions  

# How can I find out if my photovoltaic solar system meets eligibility requirements for an incentive?  

Incentives are available to all PPL Electric Utilities customers with a non-residential rate code. Work with your contractor or design team and reach out to our program team to check if your system meets the program requirements.  

# What documents are required for incentive submission and pre-approval?  

1.	 Copy of current PPL Electric Utilities bill.   
2.	 Cost estimate, e.g., scope of work, proposal or project quote.   
3.	 Manufacturers’ specification sheets for qualifying equipment.   
4.	 Estimation of energy savings and customer’s 12-month historic usage.   
5.	 Completed, signed W-9 with tax identification for payee on the most current IRS version (Rev. 2024). a.	 Third-party payee form if contractor is receiving the incentive.   
6.	 Confirmation of PPL Electric Utilities service and interconnection application (work order number and submission confirmation). a.	 Interconnection costs presented by PPL Electric Utilities. Incentive application can be submitted before this cost is received; however, pre-approval will not be given until this cost is received and the IIR is signed and provided to the program team. b.	 If your project will be virtually net metered, your Virtual Metering applications should be submitted with program documents.  

# How is the incentive pre-approval amount determined?  

Applications will be eligible for incentives based on the application submission date. All solar pre-approval incentives will be calculated using PV Watts. Incentives will be capped based on energy usage displaced from PPL Electric Utilities’ system. Customers without kWh load offset by solar are not eligible for incentives.  

# When will my incentive application be pre-approved?  

Once all energy usage, cost documentation, and a signed IIR has been provided, your application will be reviewed within 15 business days. A site visit may be needed to confirm that construction has not started and all application materials are accurate.  

# Can I cancel my current application and reapply for higher incentives?  

No. Incentives change in order to identify and encourage new projects to fill the phase pipeline and achieve program savings targets. Therefore, only new solar project applications will be eligible for the $\$0.08/k W h$ offset from the customer site. Projects that already have an incentive application will not be eligible. Incentives will be based on the incentive application submission date, and current incentive and interconnection applications may not be canceled and resubmitted under the new incentive rate.  

# How long is the measurement and verification (M&V) period?  

The M&V period is dependent on project size. The data requirements can take up to 4 months based on system size and performance.  

o I need to submit an application to interconnect my solar system to the transmission or distribution grid?  

Yes, PPL Electric Utilities needs to perform an electrical review of your system to ensure a safe and reliable interconnection.   
You can initiate this review through pplelectric.com/interconnection.  

Are solar systems that have received grants eligible for program incentives, and are tax incentives considered when looking at cost effectiveness?  

Yes, grant awards are simply subtracted from the overall project cost. Tax benefits will be considered, but documentation may be required  

Will Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) be deducted from my project cost?  

SRECs are not considered when calculating project costs as they are highly variable due to their changing value in the marketplace.  

I’m a PPL Electric Utilities customer who will be entering into a power purchasing agreement for a new solar photovoltaic system. Will this system be eligible for incentives?  

Yes, if the installation passes eligibility requirements, the purchasing agreement is eligible for incentives.  

# How are incentive caps determined based on my energy (kWh) and demand (kW) usage?  

Projects are also capped at energy usage (kWh) offset annually by system generation. For example, if your building used 200,000 kWh in the past 12 months, but your system generates 300,000 kWh per year, the project would only be eligible for the $\$0.08$ kWh on the 200,000 kWh offset for a total incentive of $200,000\times\dot{\mathsf{S}}0.08=\dot{\mathsf{S}}16,000$ . If your building used 500,000 kWh in the past 12 months, the incentive would use the full 300,000 kWh generated now being offset for a total incentive of $\$24,000$ .
