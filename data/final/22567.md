Considering purchasing a Energy-Star or NEEM certified manufactured home? Will you be locating it within Lane Electric’s service area? You may be eligible for a $\$500$ rebate. For more details on how you might qualify, please take some time to review the guidelines below.  

# Program Requirements  

To be eligible for a rebate, Lane Electric must receive:

2. A copy of the sales receipt, and   
3. A copy of the Energy-Star/NEEM Certificate within 90 days of installation.  

Because Lane Electric has a limited budget, availability of funds is also limited. Therefore, retailers cannot guarantee credits. Please contact Lane Electric at 541-484-1151 before purchase to verify the availability of funds. Credits will be honored on a first-come first-served basis.  

Home must be a permanent residence (no hardship permits) served by Lane Electric.
