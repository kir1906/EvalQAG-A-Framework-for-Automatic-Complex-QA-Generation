Mississippi Power offers customers a one-time $2,000 cash incentive on a
first-come, first-served basis when installing a UL 1741-certified battery
storage system.

The utility also offers the [Low-to-Moderate Income Residential Incentive
Program](https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/22541), but
customers are only allowed to choose one of the two incentives, and no
incentive will be available beyond 2027.
