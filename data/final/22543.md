# What is the Charger Prep Credit?  

This program provides a one-time credit to help   
business customers cover the cost of preparing their site for an electric vehicle (EV) charger.   
Acceptable upgrades include electrical wiring and other required electrical upgrades to support Level 2 or higher EV chargers. This   
credit can be used for workplaces, businesses, multifamily dwellings, transit stations and schools. It does not cover the cost of permitting, EV charger installation or the EV charging equipment itself.   
If an electrical contractor has facilitated the   
installation of an EV charger after May 19,   
2022, and within the last 120 days (date of your   
final invoice or approved permit), you can apply   
for a Charger Prep Credit to help cover the cost.   
The credit amount is based on charger type,   
total kW, and if a Duke Energy service upgrade   
was needed.
