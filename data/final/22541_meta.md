Mississippi Power offers low-to-moderate income residential customers a one-
time $3,000 cash incentive on a first-come, first-served basis when installing
a renewable distributed generation facility with a capacity of at least 4 kW-
DC (and one that does not generate more than 110% of the customer's year
annual peak demand).

The utility also offers the [Battery Storage Incentive
Program](https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/22606), but
customers are only allowed to choose one of the two incentives, and no
incentive will be available beyond 2027.
