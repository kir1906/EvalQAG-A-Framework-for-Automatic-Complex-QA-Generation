# Just plug in. Your EV does all the work and you get all the rewards.  

It’s easy to earn rewards while doing good for the environment and helping us build a more efficient and resilient grid. Enrolling in Smart Charging comes with rebates for purchasing and installing a qualifying Level 2 home EV charger plus ongoing bill credits. So, how does Smart Charging work?

Your charger will automatically shift its charging schedule away from peak times when energy use is high and sustainable energy resources are scarcer. We call these Smart Charging Events.  

During these events, your charger will pause your vehicle charging. It will start again once the event is over. You can opt out of any event via your charging app.  

When you participate, you can earn a $\$25$ credit on your bill at the end of a Smart Charging season (October to March and April to September).
