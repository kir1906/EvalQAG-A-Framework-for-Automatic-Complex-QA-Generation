 PSE&G’s EV Trade Ally Program is now available. More information can be found in the FAQ section below.  

 Customers can qualify for a reduction of up to $\$5,000$ in any required customer deposit for Utility-Side Make-Ready (USMR) work performed by PSE&G to support the additional electric load in a safe, reliable manner.  

Once enrolled in the program, customers may receive an Off-Peak Charging credit for charging during off-peak periods to help reduce costs.  

 Off-peak periods are defined as 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. (EST) Monday–Friday, and all day on Saturday and Sunday.  

The Off-Peak Charging credit is approximately $\$0.105,$ /kWh. Prior to June 1, 2023, the Off-Peak Charging credit was approximately $\$0.02$ /kWh.  Customers with a third party supplier (TPS) will only receive the distribution portion of the Off-Peak Charging Credit. In this case, the credit will continue to be approximately $\$0.02$ /kWh.  Any charging during on-peak hours will decrease your total off-peak charging credit.
