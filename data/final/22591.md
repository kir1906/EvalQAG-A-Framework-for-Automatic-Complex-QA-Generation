# Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE)  

# GREEN BANK  

# A Finance Initiative of the Efficiency Maine Green Bank  

A C-PACE program allows commercial property owners to access financing to undertake energy efficiency and clean energy improvements on their buildings and repay the investment over time. Like other project financing. a C-PACE mechanism uses borrowed capital from a capital provider to pay for the upfront costs associated with energy efficiency or renewable energy improvements. Unlike other project financing, the borrowed capital is secured by a property tax assessment with an associated lien on the subject property. The security provided by the tax assessment results in several compelling features, including longer-term financing and transferability of the repayment obligations to subsequent owners of the property. In turn, C-PACE financing strengthens the business case for investment in longer payback and deeper building retrofits beyond what may be possible with traditional financing.  

# C-PACE in Maine  

In 2021, the Legislature enacted L.D. 340, An Act to Allow for the Establishment of Commercial Property Assessed Clean EnergyPrograms(The $^{\prime\prime}\mathsf{C}$ -PACE Act"). The C-PACE Act authorizes Efficiency Maine Trust (the "Trust"), a third party contracted by the Trust, or a municipality that has adopted a C-PACE ordinance to establish a C-PACE program.

# Program Development  

In preparation for the launch of the C-PACE Program, the Efficiency Maine Green Bank researched program design options, reviewed materials from other jurisdictions, met with national experts, interviewed Maine-based stakeholders, and held a stakeholder workshop. It then undertook a formal rulemaking process, adopting a new administrative rule governing the implementation of its C-PACE Program. The rule enumerates underwriting standards, quality assurance provisions, and how the program will be administered, whether administered by the Trust (or its agent) or by a municipality. The Efficiency Maine Green Bank also developed a set of program guidelines to spell out the operational details of its C-PACE Program and provide additional detail. This resource and other supporting documents can be found below under Program Guidelines and Supporting Documents.  

Maine's C-PACE Program was launched in the spring of 2023 and is available in a small number of participating municipalities. The Efficiency Maine Green Bank is curently working with several other interested municipalities to register to participate in the program.

# Municipalities  

The C-PACE Act requires that municipalities wishing to participate in the C-PACE Program adopt a C-PACE ordinance in their jurisdiction. A municipality must also complete a C-PACE Municipality Participation Agreement with the Trust that establishes the Trust as the municipality's C-PACE program administrator. A Maine municipality that adopts a C-PACE ordinance and executes a C-PACE Municipality Participation Agreement with the Trust is a "Participating Municipality." A list of participating municipalities can be found here.  

Municipalities interested in learning about the program can review the Municipality Participation Guide. Municipalities interested in becoming participating municipalities in the C-PACE Program should:
