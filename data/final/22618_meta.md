 ## Summary : 
 [H.B. 1526](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1193) of
2020 established an offshore wind energy procurement target for Phase II
utilities (Dominion Energy). The legislation directs Dominion to generate
5,200 megawatts (MW) of offshore wind energy by December 31, 2034. The
deadline was later [amended](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-
bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+CHAP0809) to December 31, 2032. Dominion is authorized
to own and operate between 2,500 MW and 3,000 MW of the required capacity,
however, it will be up to the Virginia State Corporation Commission to
determine the reasonableness and prudence of any such costs incurred by
Dominion.
