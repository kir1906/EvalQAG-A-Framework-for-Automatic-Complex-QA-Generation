# Irrigation  

# Advanced Pumping Efficiency Program  

A worn pump could be costing you hundreds or thousands of dollars in excess electric charges and reducing access to water. A pump is the heart of an irrigation system. When it does not meet growing requirements, crops can suffer in size and quality.  

# Pump testing  

Schedule subsidized tests for existing pumps of 25 horsepower (hp) or greater every 23 months so that you can maintain a reliable pump that will deliver the right flow and pressure for optimum irrigation efficiency.  

Learn more at jcast.fresnostate.edu/pumpefficiency/index.html.  

# Agricultural Irrigation Pump Variable Frequency Drive

•	Rebate applicable only to agricultural buildings in climate zones CZ06, CZ07, CZ08, CZ09, CZ10, CZ11, CZ12, CZ13, CZ14 and CZ15.   
•	Rebate must be submitted within 60 days of purchase, install or account establishment, whichever is latest.  

# Additional details:  

•	Place the VSD as close to the motor as possible when applying VSD to a standard duty National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) motor. Failure to do so may result   
in premature motor failure.   
•	Maintain sufficient airflow through the motor to prevent overheating.   
•	Must comply with the practices and requirements of American National Standards   
Institute (ANSI)/Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 519-2014 found here: standards.ieee.org/standard/519-2014.html.  

# Agricultural Ventilation Fans  

Installing agricultural ventilation fans helps dairy and livestock operations managers avoid compromising animal health while still improving energy efficiency, increasing animal comfort and reducing contaminant exposure in livestock holding facilities. These fans are box, panel or basket fans and are sometimes designated as low-volume, high-speed fans that are used primarily to cool poultry and livestock.  

# Requirements:  

•	Customer must convert from an agricultural ventilation fan to a high-efficiency, agricultural ventilation fan specifically designed for dairy ventilation.   
•	New fans must replace ventilation fans one-for-one, and must be designed to provide

# Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Rebates  

![](images/c5d54107db1bbf2d3bffbcf7c528a22f25d38f8db5378196e326e8f9fa1954aa.jpg)  

Depending on climate and other factors, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment consumes roughly 40 to 50 percent of a commercial building’s total energy usage. Air leakage, heating and cooling systems that respond poorly to an ever-changing climate, and old or inefficient HVAC equipment can lead to poor system performance, higher monthly utility bills and can negatively impact the environment.  

Commercial buildings with HVAC systems are at the heart of this effort. With HVAC upgrades, buildings can reduce the total amount of energy used, lowering operating expenses and monthly utility bills while improving the health and comfort of employees and customers. After an HVAC system upgrade, businesses can become more environmentally sustainable and meet energy-efficiency requirements.  

Once a business or organization upgrades its HVAC system, it’s important to provide periodic maintenance to protect the investment. Regular maintenance ensures the efficiency of mechanical systems and maximizes the life of equipment by providing coil cleaning, filter changes and factory-recommended tasks. For business owners and managers in Central and Northern California, finding an HVAC contractor who can perform this work is easy. Simply refer to PG&E’s list of participating HVAC contractors.  

Looking to reduce the upfront costs of your upgrade? PG&E offers $0\%$ interest On-Bill Financing for qualified projects. To learn more, visit pge.com/obf.

# Demand Controlled Ventilation for Packaged HVAC Units  

Add demand controlled ventilation (DCV) to your packaged HVAC unit. DCV enables your economizer to reduce the amount of outside air when the conditioned space is occupied by fewer people than the design capacity. A ${\mathfrak{C}}{\mathfrak{O}}_{2}$ sensor provides the occupancy signal to the advanced digital economizer control (ADEC) system. This is a good energy-efficiency measure for conditioned spaces with highly-variable or low occupancy. If your rooftop unit already has an ADEC, then you have the option of just adding a $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{0}_{2}$ sensor.  

# Requirements:  

•	Customer must pick correct measure code for the type of packaged HVAC unit and enter the HVAC unit’s tons of air-conditioning (AC) capacity on the rebate application as “Quantity.” See the HVAC unit’s nameplate for cooling capacity. (1 ton AC capacity $=$ 12,000 Btuh)   
•	Rebate is based on the HVAC unit’s cooling capacity and is maxed at $\$500$ per ADEC, plus $\complement{0_{2}}$ sensor system, or $\$300$ for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ sensor.   
•	Installation must follow manufacturer’s requirements. Customer must also ensure that controls are installed and operate according to current applicable building and energy codes.   
•	Customer must install DCV on existing operational packaged HVAC unit.   
•	Installer and manufacturer must warrant equipment for at least two years for parts and labor. All installed equipment must be new.   
•	Rebate cannot be combined with ADEC or enhanced ventilation control (EVC) rebate offers for the same HVAC unit.   
•	Rebate only applies to the following building types: assembly, education (primary/ secondary school, relocatable classrooms, universities), small office, restaurant (fast-food, sit-down), retail, manufacturing (biotech).   
•	Installation address must have a commercial electric account with PG&E.   
•	Rebate must be submitted within 60 days of purchase, install or account establishment, whichever is latest.

# Enhanced Ventilation Control for Packaged HVAC Units  

Add enhanced ventilation control (EVC) to your packaged HVAC unit. EVC kits add variable speed, ${\mathfrak{C}}{\mathfrak{O}}_{2}$ sensors and advanced digital economizer control (ADEC) to existing packaged HVAC units. These retrofit add-on technologies can reduce the ventilation rate and outside air when the conditioned space is occupied by fewer people than the design capacity. This is a good energy-efficiency measure for conditioned spaces with highlyvariable or low occupancy.  

# Requirements:  

•	Customer must install EVC on existing operational packaged HVAC unit.   
•	Rebate cannot be combined with ADEC or demand control ventilation (DCV) rebate offers for the same HVAC unit.   
•	Rebate only applies to the following building types: assembly, education (primary/ secondary school, universities), small office, restaurant (fast-food, sit-down), retail,   
manufacturing (biotech) and grocery.   
•	Installation address must have a commercial electric account with PG&E.   
•	Rebate must be submitted within 60 days of purchase, install or account establishment, whichever is latest.
