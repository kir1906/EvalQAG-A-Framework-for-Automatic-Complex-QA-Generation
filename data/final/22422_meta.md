S.B. 952, enacted in June 2021, created energy storage targets of 300MW by
December 31, 2024; 650MW by December 31, 2027; and 1,000MW by December 31,
2030.

The bill also required the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority to open
proceedings regarding the development and implementation of programs for
energy storage systems connected to the grid, including programs for
residential customers, commercial & industrial customers, and energy storage
systems in front of the meter not located on customer premises. The Authority
must also consider other programs to incentivize storage deployment connected
to the grid, including new rate designs.
