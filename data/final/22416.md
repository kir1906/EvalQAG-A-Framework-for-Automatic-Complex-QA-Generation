# Geographic Diversity:  

Please note that, to enhance geographic diversity, MEA may consider a project’s location within the State when determining a grant decision.  

# Review Process:  

Each application package will be evaluated competitively by an Evaluation Team. The Evaluation Team will be made up of MEA staff with relevant experience. The evaluation includes three (3) review steps that are detailed below.  

1. Program Manager Eligibility Review: The MEA Resilient Maryland Program Manager reviews the application for eligibility according to the Minimum Eligibility Criteria listed in this FOA. An application that does not meet the Minimum Eligibility Criteria will be rejected from funding consideration and the applicant will be notified.  

2. Evaluation Team Member Individual Review: Each member of the Evaluation Team reviews and scores each application according to the Evaluation Criteria established in this FOA.  

3. Evaluation Team Group Review and Award Recommendation: The Evaluation Team convenes for a group review of their findings and scores. An Evaluation Team member is permitted to modify their score for an eligible application considering new information discovered during the Group Review discussion. The final score for each complete application is determined by taking the average of the individual Evaluation Team member scores for that application. The Evaluation Team will finalize all scores and make an award recommendation for each application that has scored at least “10” or higher. Grants will be recommended in order of highest final score to lowest eligible final score, until all available funding is exhausted, or all eligible grants are funded, whichever comes first.  

# Partial Grants:  

Partial awards are possible under this AOI, depending on the number of complete proposals received and associated total grant funds requested. Full grants will be made for approved projects, based on rankings of applications, in descending order from highest to lowest, until grant funds are exhausted. If sufficient grant funds are not available to fully fund a project, the applicant will be given an option to accept partial funding. If the applicant declines, MEA will offer partial grant funding under this same structure to the next qualified applicant until all funding has been expended or all remaining projects have rejected the offer.  

# Program General Provisions:  

MEA grant programs are covered by general requirements that will be made part of the grant agreement between MEA and a grantee. A copy of these provisions (“General Provisions”) is available on MEA’s website here8; this document will be incorporated into all MEA FY25 grant agreements.  

In addition to the General Provisions, the following funding qualifications apply to this Program:  

MEA may obligate all or none of the FY25 Resilient Maryland program budget, based on the quality and eligibility of applications submitted to MEA; and All projects that receive financial support from MEA must adhere to its Fossil Fuel Policy, which is provided as Appendix 2 to this FOA.  

# Grant Funding and Payment:  

The following requirements apply to each grantee:  

Electronic Payments: Participation in MEA grant programs is voluntary. To ensure the secure transmission of grant funds, each grantee receiving MEA grant funding are generally required to receive electronic payments from the State of Maryland. Electronic payments are set up through the State of Maryland’s Comptroller’s Office. Each grantee must fill out and submit the “ACH/Direct Deposit Authorization for Vendor Payments Form X-10” to the Comptroller’s Office via the submission methods outlined in the X-10 form. ACH/Direct Deposit Authorization for Vendor Payment Form X-10 cannot be sent to MEA. This must go to the  

appropriate location specified by the Comptroller’s Office. Failure to submit ACH/Direct Deposit Authorization Form X-10 may result in grant reimbursement being delayed. If an applicant is unable to receive ACH/Direct Deposit payments, MEA may make an exception to this requirement on a case-by-case basis.  

Reporting: Each grantee must ensure timely and current compliance with the Program’s reporting requirements. Each Resilient Maryland, AOI 1 grantee will be required to submit bimonthly progress reports (“BPRs”) throughout the life of the project. MEA will not authorize the reimbursement of any grant funds until the grantee is current and compliant with all reporting requirements.  

Encumbrance of Funds: Upon receipt of a commitment letter (if applicable) or a grant agreement or signed by both the grantee and MEA, MEA will encumber the grant funds.  

Prior Expenses Restriction: No costs for the project incurred prior to execution of a commitment letter (if relevant) or grant agreement will be reimbursed by MEA.  

# Required Application Documents:  

# Each application to the FY25 Resilient Maryland Program, AOI 1, must include the following:  

1. Application Data: Complete, accurate, and up-todate information asked by all applicable fields in the FY25 Resilient Maryland Application Portal. Failure to provide required information will result in the rejection of the application from consideration. An applicant whose application is rejected for this reason is free to reapply, so long as they meet the requirements of this FOA.  

2. Project Proposal: A complete and accurate project proposal that meets the following required content and formatting restrictions:

NOTE: The MEA Resilient Maryland Program Manager may disqualify an application from funding consideration if the content of the Project Proposal does not meet a minimum quality standard for evaluation. An eligible applicant whose application is rejected for this reason is free to revise their proposal and reapply.  

3. Project Budget Workbook: A complete and accurate FY25 Resilient Maryland AOI 1 Project Budget Workbook. A copy of this workbook is available on the Resilient Maryland webpage10 in the “Program Documents” section.  

4. IRS Form(s) W9: The applicant must provide a complete, accurate, and signed IRS Form W9. The IRS Form W9 organization name, address, and employer identification number (“EIN”,  

sometimes referred to as a taxpayer identification number, or “TIN”) will be used to execute a grant agreement, if the project is selected for an award. A blank copy of the most recent IRS Form W9 can be found on the IRS Form W9 webpage11. NOTE: Once a grant agreement is executed with a grantee, MEA cannot change the IRS Form W9 information. No exceptions.  

5. Good Standing Documentation: An applicant must provide evidence of Good Standing with the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation (“DAT”) unless it is a unit of local or State government or a nonprofit organization. Further, any contractor that the applicant works with on the project must also demonstrate Good Standing with Maryland DAT. The applicant must include either (1) a screenshot or PDF of the applicant’s result from Maryland DAT’s Business Entity Search12 that indicates Good Standing; or (2) a copy of a Certificate of Status13 from Maryland DAT that indicates Good Standing. The applicant must include this documentation for itself, as well as its contractor(s) (if they are identified at the time of application). For (a) contractor(s) selected after a grant agreement has been executed, if the project is awarded, evidence of Good Standing must be provided to MEA when a formal agreement is executed between the grantee and the contractor(s).

# FY25 Resilient Maryland Program, Area of Interest 1: Preconstruction Planning Funding Opportunity Announcement Appendix 1: Glossary of Terms  

Applicant: An applicant to the FY25 Resilient Maryland Program that meets the definition of “applicant” in the Code of Maryland Regulations, Title 14, Subtitle 26, Chapter 02, Section 02. Definitions (COMAR 14.26.02.0216).  

Maryland Energy Administration (MEA): An executive agency of the State of Maryland with a mission to promote clean, affordable, reliable energy and energyrelated greenhouse gas emission reductions to benefit Marylanders in a just and equitable manner. MEA provides incentives to Maryland residents, businesses, and other Maryland organizations to help pay for clean, efficient, and resilient energy technologies and upgrades. MEA also advises the Governor and Maryland General Assembly on all energy matters. MEA is not a private entity. MEA is an official State of Maryland government agency.  

Microgrid: An interconnected system of distributed energy resources (“DERs”) that function together to provide reliable electrical or thermal energy to connected loads in at least two (2) buildings, facilities, or other sites; and is able to rapidly or seamlessly resume operation following a utility power outage, sustain critical loads in the absence of utility power, and is able to rapidly or seamlessly transition back to paralleling with the electric utility following an outage event. For the purposes of the Resilient Maryland Program, a “Microgrid” differs from a “Resilient Facility Power System” by providing benefits to more than one (1) site.  

Project: A project that is proposed by an applicant to the FY25 Resilient Maryland Program, in accordance with the “Eligible Activities” section of this FOA, and in accordance with COMAR 14.26.02.0217.  

Resiliency Hub: A location within a community that is easily accessible and walkable–within a one-half $(\%)$ mile radius–that provides community members with: (1) plug power for personal electronic devices such as cell phones, smartphones, tablets, and laptop computers; (2) plug power for portable medical equipment such as dialysis and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines; (3) refrigeration for temperature-sensitive items; (4) dedicated, safe, healthy conditioned space for community members to locate within; and (5) safe and adequate lighting. A resiliency hub is not a substitute for a full-scale emergency shelter. Rather, it is a nearby community location that residents can quickly and easily access until the emergency or grid outage situation concludes, or more robust emergency response services arrive.  

Resilient Facility Power System (“RFPS”): An interconnected system of distributed energy resources (“DERs”) that function together to provide reliable electrical or thermal energy to connected loads in a single building, facility, or other site; and is able to rapidly or seamlessly resume operation following a utility power outage, sustain critical loads in the absence of utility power, and is able to rapidly or seamlessly transition back to parallelling with the electric utility following an outage event. For the purposes of the Resilient Maryland Program, a “Resilient Facility Power System” differs from a “Microgrid” by providing benefits to only one (1) site, instead of multiple sites.

# FY25 Resilient Maryland Program, Area of Interest 1: Preconstruction Planning Funding Opportunity Announcement Appendix 2: MEA Fossil Fuel Policy  

Each project that receives financial support from MEA must adhere to the MEA Fossil Fuel Policy:  

● Projects that include fossil-fuel or other combustion technologies that produce greenhouse gas emissions are typically not eligible for funding. Specific examples of projects that would not be eligible for funding under the Program include: ○ Efforts that expand the use of fossil fuel or natural gas technologies, except where meeting one of the exemptions or those efforts are technically infeasible; Expansion of infrastructure that results in an expansion of fossil fuel delivery volume; ○ New installations of fossil fuel or natural gas fired technologies; Projects that result in significant life extension of fossil fuel fired systems beyond basic health and safety repairs or efforts that enhance efficiency but do not extend the gas system/or fossil fueled fired equipment life.  

Note: Limited exceptions may be considered where there is no other technically feasible technology or where a source can be demonstrated to be zero emission.  Any applications for projects involving fossil fuel should provide evidence that a technical analysis of why electrified or other zero emission alternatives cannot be implemented, this analysis should not be on the basis of operating or capital costs alone.  

● While basic health and safety repairs or efforts that enhance efficiency but do not extend the gas system/or fossil fueled fired equipment life are allowable, projects must be part of a project that includes other energy efficiency improvements that reduce or eliminate fossil fuel use.  This situation is anticipated to primarily, but not exclusively, be seen in residential energy efficiency projects.  

# Exemptions:  

All exemption requests will be in writing and provide a thorough technical analysis of why electrification and other zero emission technologies cannot be applied from a technical perspective and consider the following:  

● Currently available commercialized technologies,   
● Ability of locationally specific existing utility infrastructure to support non-fossil fuel applications,   
● Thorough evaluation of alternatives,   
● Mitigation efforts to offset the greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuel use,   
● A description of any efforts to make infrastructure ready for future technologies, such as green hydrogen, or phase out fossil fueled technology in the future, and Statutorily directed activities.  

Operating and capital costs alone will not be considered justification for any exemption and exemptions will not be approved purely on cost saving opportunities alone.
