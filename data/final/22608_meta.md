 ## Summary : 
 Duke Energy's Improve & Save Program functions like an on-bill financing
program and provides an opportunity for homeowner and renters to receive
energy efficiency improvements with potentially no money down. Interested
customers can start by filling out an eligibility form on Duke's website. If
eligible, the customer will then schedule a free energy audit with a program-
approved third-party. The energy advisor performing the audit will recommend
efficiency improvements, which may include new HVAC systems and duct sealing,
attic insulation and air sealing, and heat pump water heaters.

Duke will then pay for the equipment, upgrades, and installation. Where
applicable, existing rebates will be applied to the cost of the equipment, and
the remaining balance will be repaid over 10 years on the property's electric
bill.
