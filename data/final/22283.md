# Benefits of fleet electrification  

# Save money  

EVs are 4X more efficient than diesel and natural gas engines and offer significant fuel cost savings.1  Plus, you can take advantage of infrastructure incentives available through the EV Fleet program.  

# Eliminate tailpipe emissions  

Electric vehicles have zero tailpipe emissions and a smaller carbon footprint than conventional vehicles, which means cleaner air for your community and fewer greenhouse gasses from your fleet.  

# Simplify maintenance  

Electric vehicles have fewer and less complex parts, which simplifies maintenance, results in less down time, and lowers overall lifetime operation and maintenance costs.  

# Demonstrate leadership  

Your company can help lead the way to a cleaner, greener California and be a good environmental steward.  

# Get ahead  

Take advantage of PG&E incentives while getting a jump start on regulatory requirements like California’s Advanced Clean Fleets Rule.  

# Support California’s goals  

Transportation is the single largest source of climate-related pollution.2 Fleet electrification is critical to helping the state reach its greenhouse gas reduction goals in 2030 and 2050.

# Incentives and rebates  

PG&E offers infrastructure incentives and charger rebates to offset costs.

Through the EV Fleet Program, PG&E will construct, own and maintain all electrical infrastructure up to the customer’s meter.  

Fleet operators will design, build, own, operate, and maintain the electrical infrastructure from the customer meter to the EV charger. In select instances, PG&E may also cover this portion of the work.\*  

\*Incentives limited to 25 vehicles per site; sites with more vehicles to be considered on an individual basis.  

\*Charging equipment rebates for school buses, transit buses and sites in disadvantaged communities. Rebate not to exceed $50\%$ of charger equipment. EVSE must meet minimum and standard requirements to be eligible for rebate. Fortune 1000 companies are not eligible.

# Webinars  

Program overview: Watch this recorded webinar for an overview of PG&E's EV Fleet program. Learn how you can save money, eliminate tailpipe emissions, and simplify maintenance.   
Stacking incentives: Watch this recorded webinar for an overview on all available federal, state and regional funding opportunities available for deploying zero emission vehicles. PG&E has coordinated with multiple funding agencies to simplify and maximize customer benefit.   
EV Fleet Savings Calculator: Learn how to use the EV Fleet Savings Calculator tool to better understand key total cost of ownership inputs, including incentives, energy costs, and infrastructure considerations.   
Total cost of ownership: Understand the costs (and cost-savings) involved with deploying EVs. Fleets that are used to managing conventional vehicles and fuels may miss key budgeting considerations that can make or break an EV project.   
Choosing the right EVSE hardware: For any fleet considering a transition to electric, choosing the appropriate EVSE hardware is a critical initial step.   
Managing EV charging costs: Hear from two charging infrastructure providers to learn about the software available to optimize and manage charging cycles and costs.   
Charging infrastructure design: Design your charging infrastructure to accommodate short- and long-term needs. Learn more about the benefits of working with PG&E and an electrical contractor early.   
Generating revenue with LCFS: Learn how fleets in California can generate additional revenue by operating electric vehicles and equipment through the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) program.   
Creating a competitive funding application: Learn how fleets can create competitive funding applications to secure grants and incentives that buy down the cost of transportation electrification.   
Resiliency planning for EVs: Developing an energy plan that considers resiliency and accounts for needs 5 to 10 year from now helps mitigate unexpected infrastructure cost.   
Permitting for EVs: Installing EV charging infrastructure requires building permits to begin site construction. Learn about the process and requirements to obtain site permits, as well as the anticipated construction timelines.
