# Spring 2022 Pilot Program Description  

In 2022, the legislature appropriated $\$1,000,000$ in funding to pilot a program to incentivize the installation of charging stations at multiunit dwelling affordable housing units, making EV home charging access more equitable and affordable for residents in multiunit housing.  

The program recently awarded 13 project proposals from affordable and non-profit multiunit housing providers across 8 counties. These projects will result in 84 new Level 2 charging ports at 37 locations, reducing the home charging access barrier to EV ownership for 6,230 homes in affordable multifamily buildings.
