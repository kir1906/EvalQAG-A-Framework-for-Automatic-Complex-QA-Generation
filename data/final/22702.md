# Solar Electric (PV) Incentives  

To encourage Ashland residents and businesses to install new solar electric systems interconnected with the electrical supply grid, the City of Ashland offers financial incentives for qualifying installations. This incentive is frequently combined with Federal Incentives to help reduce the initial cost of the system.  

# Is my site good for solar?  

There are many factors to determine if your property is a good candidate for solar. Assessing your roof is a good place to start. You will need to determine how much sunlight your roof receives. A south facing roof with access to direct sunlight for a majority of the day is the ideal condition. The size of your roof will also determine how many panels you can fit. Every house is a unique situation so it's best to reach out to your local installer.  

Use our GIS map to see your solar potential  

# Current Incentive  

Solar electric installations that pass their electric inspections can receive incentive payments of $\$600$ from the City of Ashland.  

In addition, your system will benefit from Net Metering, which means you can accumulate unused electricity from the sunnier months to apply towards your electric usage in the winter months. Any remaining energy credits after your March 31 billing cycle will then be credited towards your account based on the municipal utility's wholesale rates on the next bill.  

# Program Requirements  

The owner of the system must own or be a tenant of the facility where the system is installed.   
The system must be interconnected with the electric service at the facility and be net-metered.   
The system must have at least 2,500 W of panels with total solar resource fractions (TSRFs) of at least $75\%$ . Qualifying systems must have at least 2,500 Watts of panels with TSRFs of at least $75\%$ that are independent (independent maximum power point tracking) from panels with less than $75\%$ TSRFs.  

The system must be installed with permits from the City's Building Safety Division and comply with all permit requirements.  

# Application Materials  

Ensure that you have read all program details and understand all program eligibility requirements. (Please contact staff early in the process if you have questions.)  

Complete the following documents:  

Application and Compliance form $\circ$ Interconnection Questionnaire Electric Power Purchase Agreement  

Upload completed and signed documents with our online form. Submit a roof plan with corresponding TSRFs of each panel. Send a copy of the project invoice.  

# EV CHARGERS  

# Commercial and Workplace Charging Incentive  

Electrifying transportation is an important part of Ashland's Climate and Energy Action Plan. Removing fossil fuels from our transportation infrastructure reduces climatealtering emissions, improves local air quality, and creates additional load for our locallyowned electric utility. Business locations are a key area to support vehicle electrification. Workplaces may benefit by saving money through electrifying fleet vehicles, offering an additional benefit for employees, or as an amenity for customers. The City of Ashland will reimburse a fixed amount per charger installed. Incentives are available for new, Level 2 electric vehicle chargers.  

For more information about the benefits, please see this resource on workplace charging by our partners at Forth.  

# Incentive Amount  

1 charger $=$ up to $\$1,000$   
2-4 chargers $=$ up to $\$500$ additional per charger  

For example: A local hotel purchases two chargers at a cost of $\$500$ each, then pays the electrician $\$400$ to install them. The business can apply for an incentive up to $\$1,400$ $(\$500+$500$ ). According to the table, $\$1,500$ is the maximum incentive for two chargers.  

# Applicant Requirements  

Your business may apply for this incentive if:  

The business has an active Commercial, Industrial, or Government electric account, in good standing with Ashland Municipal Electric Utility, OR   
The business is an active, registered contributor to Ashland's Transient Occupancy Tax  

# Charger Equipment Requirements  

Chargers must be new and capable of level 2 charging.   
Costs may include a pedestal for mounting.   
Chargers with more than one "plug" (J1772 connectors) are considered a single charger.   
Electrical upgrades must be completed by a licensed electrician and installation shall meet all local, state, and federal codes.   
Labor and material costs are eligible, so long as they are necessary for the installation.  

# Documentation  

Specific documentation requirements include, at minimum:  

Business name, applicant name, and contact information   
Paid invoices for required electrical upgrades showing labor and material costs.   
Copy of required permits, including final inspection if necessary.   
The City of Ashland reserves the right to request additional information or documentation to process an application.  

# Induction Cooktop/Range Incentive  

Induction cooktops heat pots and pans directly through an electromagnetic field. The magnetic field strikes the iron molecules in your cookware, producing heat. This heat is only transferred between the coil and the pan, allowing induction cooking to be faster, more precise, and more efficient. From a safety standpoint, there is no open flame or indoor air pollution that is generated from combustion.  

# Do I need special cookware?  

You will need cooking pans that contain iron. This is needed to activate the electromagnetic field that generates heat. Copper, aluminum, and glass will not work. If you are unsure, do a magnet test to the bottom of your pan. If purchasing new kitchenware, check to make sure it is compatible with induction cooktops.  

# Are they noisy?  

There is a faint humming sound that comes the energy transfer.  

How is induction cooking better for indoor air quality? Induction cooking does not produce combustion gases.  

# Are induction cooktops more efficient?  

Yes! Due to the direct transfer of heat there is less energy wasted. Various studies have found anywhere from $75{-}90\%$ of the heat generated is used for cooking. In comparison, when cooking with gas, only around $30–40\%$ of the heat generated is used for cooking.  

# Do induction cooktops affect pacemakers?  

Due to the electromagnetic field, there can be interference with a pacemaker. Consult your doctor.

# Current Incentives  

These incentives are for permanent installations of an induction cooktop or range (no portable units). A cooktop is the standalone burners that go on your counter. A range has both an oven and a cooktop in one appliance.  

Cooktops must be entirely induction.   
Ranges must have a cooktop that is entirely induction with an electric oven.   
The appliance cannot be dual fuel.   
Product must come with at least a 1-year warranty on induction.   
Only one induction cooktop/range incentive may be issued per residential utility account. For other account types, more than one incentive may be available. Contact city staff to learn more.  

# Residential  

· $\$150$ rebate for switching from an electric cooktop to an induction cooktop/range.   
· $\$200$ rebate for switching from a gas cooktop to an induction cooktop/range.  

# Commercial  

· $\$350$ rebate for switching from an electric cooktop to an induction cooktop/range.   
· $\$400$ rebate for switching from a gas cooktop to an induction cooktop/range.  

# Program Requirements  

Must be an active City of Ashland Electric utility customer (residential, commercial, industrial, or government) in good standing.
