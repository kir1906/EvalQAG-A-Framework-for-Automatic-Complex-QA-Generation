# About the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program  

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/09/fact-sheetbiden-harris-administration-proposes-new-standards-for-national-electric-vehicle-charging-network/) is a federally funded program that will establish a nationwide network of public EV fast charging stations in all 50 states over five years along major highways and interstates. The funding is part of the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. (/odot/Pages/IIJA.aspx)  

Oregon will receive $\$52$ million over five years from the NEVI program. The program requires minimum $20\%$ matching funds from contracted private companies, meaning Oregon will ultimately have about $\$65$ million under the NEVI program.  

The NEVI program runs over five funding years, 2022-2026. Each year the federal government distributes a portion of Oregon's $\$52$ million to ODOT.  

In total, we anticipate installing or upgrading about $50^{\star}$ public EV fast charging stations in Oregon via the NEVI program.  

\*This is an estimate and may change depending on project and material costs.  

# ODOT's role in the NEVI program  

We will manage the NEVI program in Oregon as a competitive grant and ensure it funds charging stations that meet federal standards and Oregon's EV charging goals. ODOT does not own, install, operate or maintain any of the NEVI charging stations; pre-qualified private companies will complete that work.  

See the “More resources" section near the bottom of this webpage for the full list of private companies that are pre-qualified for NEVI work.  

# Details about NEVI Round 1  

In October 2024 we selected three private EV charging companies as finalists for NEVI work on the three roads in NEVI round 1: Interstate 205, Interstate 5 south of Eugene, and U.S. Highway 97.

Note: As of October 2024, each company selection is an “intent to award" meaning we still need to negotiate and sign grant agreements with each company . We expect that process to wrap up before the end of 2024.  

About NACS connectors: We're working with the three companies to ensure the NACS (SAE J3400) connector will be included in NEVI-funded stations once it becomes UL listed and standardized.  

# Overview of planned NEVI grant funding rounds  

The NEVI program runs for five years, 2022-2026. Each year, the federal government distributes a portion of Oregon's total $\$52$ million NEVI funding to ODOT.  

As of spring 2024, the federal government has distributed the 2022 funding to ODOT, and we're approved for the forthcoming 2023 and 2024 funding distributions. (The NEVI program had a delayed start, hence why the funding years do not match the years in which the funding is distributed.)

More details about our state plan for NEVI funding  

The federal government requires each state to create and update a five-year plan for the NEVI funding.  

Read an online PDF of Oregon's latest NEVI State Plan (2024) (/odot/Programs/Documents/Climate%20Office/TEINA_Executive_Summary_June282021.pdf)  

# NEVI station design  

Each NEVI charging station will have a minimum of four DC fast charging ports capable of providing at least 150kW simultaneously. We're also aiming for at least one port to deliver more than 150kW. DC fast charging ports can charge up EVs quickly; some newer EV models can charge from $10–80\%$ in under 30 minutes.  

The federal government also has requirements for NEVI charging station design. Some highlights include:  

CCS connectors for each port, with the option for additional connector types like NACS or CHAdeMO.   
24/7 station availability.   
Multiple payment methods, including contactless credit/debit cards and phone/SMS. Payment methods must be accessible to people with disabilities.   
No membership requirements.   
Five-year maintenance plans with service from qualified technicians.  

Read the full NEVI standards and requirements on the federal register website. (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/02/28/2023- 03500/national-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-standards-and-requirements)  

# Where the NEVI stations will be located  

The NEVI program has rules about EV charging station locations:  

Stations must be no farther than 50 miles apart from each other. Stations must be located within one mile of an interstate or highway exit. Stations must be placed along roads designated as “EV alternative fuel corridors. (https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/alternative_fuel_corridors/)"  

ODOT selected the roads in Oregon's NEVI program, but the private EV charging infrastructure companies awarded grant funds will determine final charging station locations along each road.  

See the “Overview of NEVI grant funding rounds" section above for Oregon's planned NEVI roads.

# NEVI webinars and listening sessions archive  

We've hosted several webinars and listening sessions about NEVI since 2022. If you would like the archived recording of any of the below sessions, email Matt Noble in ODOT Communications. (mailto:matt.a.noble@odot.oregon.gov)  

April 2022 public webinar about the NEVI program.   
June 2022 public webinar about the NEVI program.   
October 2023 listening sessions with EV service providers and utilities, EV advocates, and the public.  

# Oregon's future charging needs  

In 2021, we completed a study to help understand Oregon's needs for public EV charging over the next 15 years: the Transportation Electrification Infrastructure Needs Analysis (/odot/Programs/Pages/TEINA.aspx). Learn more about the study at that link or read the executive summary of the study's findings (/odot/Programs/Documents/Climate%20Office/TEINA_Executive_Summary_June282021.pdf).  

# Why we support NEVI investments in EV charging infrastructure  

Electric vehicles that are partially or fully powered by electricity emit far fewer air pollutants than vehicles powered by gas or diesel. That is important because those pollutants, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, harm our health and make climate change worse.  

In Oregon, transportation is responsible for about $35\%$ of total greenhouse gas emissions. More EVs on our roads means fewer emissions, healthier communities, and a better future for Oregon and the planet. Our data says that by 2050, we're on track to reduce emissions from transportation about $60\%$ . Learn more on our transportation emissions website.
