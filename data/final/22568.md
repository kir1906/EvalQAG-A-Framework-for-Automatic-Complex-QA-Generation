# Rebate Program  

\*Please note that OMPA Rebates are only available to electric customers of OMPA member cities that participate in OMPA's Rebate Programs.

Programs are generally only available to OMPA Oklahoma member Cities.

The objective of OMPA's WisE heat pump rebate program is to assist participating member cities in encouraging residential customers and subdivision homebuilders to purchase and install energy-efficient electric heat pumps.  

The higher-efficiency units are beneficial for both the utility and the customer. The utility benefits from the reduction in summer peaks and overall improvement in load factor. Electric heat pumps also provide additional off-peak winter load. Customers heating with heat pumps could have heating bills lower in cost than other alternatives for most (or all) of the winter, with appropriate electric rate structures. During the summer, higher-efficiency heat pumps help reduce customers' air-conditioning costs.  

The minimum requirements for rebates in this program are set above the minimum standards required by the EPA's Energy Star program, which are higher than the minimum equipment standards set by the Us Department of Energy.

# WISE Ceiling Insulation Rebate Program  

The objective of OMPA's WisE ceiling insulation rebate program is to assist participating member cities in encouraging residential customers to purchase and install attic insulation. This will help the utility by lowering peak demand and will help the customer by improving their home's energy efficiency, which in turn will lower their heating and cooling costs.

# Demand and Energy Efficiency Program (DEEP)  

The Demand and Energy Efficiency Program, DEEP, is intended to assist qualified customers in member cities to reduce their electric service energy demands and costs. The reduction of these demands will help keep energy rates as low as possible and delay the need to add additional OMPA generation capacity to the system.  

DEEP provides matching funds to customers who implement energy-saving measures that will reduce their summer peak electric demands. Projects are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and funds available for an individual project are determined through submission of detailed project plans.  

For more information on DEEP contact Steve Mathena (mailto:smathena@ompa.com).
