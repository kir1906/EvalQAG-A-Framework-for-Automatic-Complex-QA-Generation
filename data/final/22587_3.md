# Save energy and cut costs  

Heat pump water heaters are much more efficient. Heat pumps operate at 550 watts, while standard water heaters use 4500 watts. This allows you to save every month on your energy bill and reduce your carbon emissions as well.  

# Two devices in one.  

It’s a water heater and dehumidifier. Heat pump water heaters absorb naturally occurring heat in the surrounding air and transfer captured heat to the water. Through this water heating process, the heat pump water heater also removes moisture in the air, helping your basement stay nice and dry. This results in lower electricity use and energy cost savings.
