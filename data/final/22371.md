# ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATION (EVCS) INCENTIVE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS JULY 1, 2024 – JUNE 30, 2025  

Hawai‘i Energy is pleased to administer an Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) Incentive Program funded by the State of Hawaiʻi under contract with the Hawai‘i Public Utilities Commission. The purpose of this incentive program is to expand the network of Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Stations and support EV charging infrastructure to encourage EV adoption throughout the state. This program provides rebates for alternating current (AC) Level 2 single- and multi-port charging stations with network connectivity and direct current fast-charging (DC FastCharging) EV charging stations with network connectivity to qualified applicants to offset the purchase and installation costs of qualifying EV charging stations. Eligible EV charging stations are either publicly available; serve multiple tenants, employees or customers; or serve EV fleets. Rebates are not intended for single-family residences or individually owned parking stalls. Additional programmatic and applicant eligibility requirements are described below in greater detail.  

Applications may be submitted between now and June 30, 2026 for qualified EV charging stations.  

 Applications must be received within 12 months of the date that a qualifying EV charging station was installed, activated and available for use (“EVCS effective date”) unless otherwise noted in this document. Funds are limited and processed on a first-come, first-serve basis, as funds are available.   
 Program approval is generally not required prior to the purchase and installation of equipment; however, prior approval is strongly recommended to confirm funding availability and verify that the equipment meets minimum qualifications for an incentive.   
 Applications and required documentation must be submitted to Hawai‘i Energy at HawaiiEnergyEVCS@leidos.com.  

addition to these state funds, Hawaiʻi Energy is offering the following additional support for qualifying EV charging stations:  

A bonus incentive up to $\$5,000$ for each AC Level 2 single- and multi-port EV charging station installed at existing or new affordable housing facilities serving households in Hawaiʻi making no more than $100\%$ of the Area Median Income (AMI) as defined per county in the state of Hawaiʻi. Rebates for approved applications will be provided on first-come, first-served basis, subject to fund availability. Thanks to the generous support of Ulupono Initiative, affordable housing development Applicants served by Kaua‘i Island Utility Cooperative are eligible for bonus incentives, as funds are available. Contact Hawaiʻi Energy at HawaiiEnergyEVCS@leidos.com for more details.
