Read all materials carefully to help avoid a denial. The Illinois EPA has a Frequently Asked Questions (en Español) document that answers many common questions.  

The Illinois EPA will not provide a verification of receipt. If you want to know whether your application was received you should send via a method that provides a receipt, such as certified mail.  

Please note that the Illinois EPA's address has recently changed. The correct addess to send your application is found on the above application form.  

Along with the application form, an applicant must submit FOUR types of documentation:  

1. Copy of the bill of sale, purchase invoice, or purchase agreement from an Illinois dealership;  

2. Documentation of proof of purchase, such as a copy of a canceled check, an invoice or bill showing that the applicable amount has been paid and that no remaining balance exists, or loan documents. Depending on the type of sales document used by the dealership, the proof of purchase could be shown on the invoice or agreement, such as a \$0 balance owed to the dealer. Separate proof of purchase documentation will be needed if the invoice shows a balance and/or that an amount is owed to the dealer. In such cases, payment documentation will need to be provided and the payment or loan amount(s) will need to match the "owed amount" on the invoice;  

3. Copy of the Illinois vehicle registration or temporary permit provided by the dealership at the time of sale/delivery (applications for vehicle registration do not satisfy the requirement); and   
4. IRS W-9 or W-8 form (see link below) (substitutions for these forms using other government documents or financial statements are not acceptable).  

Applicants are asked to only submit the above requested forms and documentation in their application, and not include other items not needed to process the application, such as those related to warranty coverage, insurance, vehicle title, power of attorney, and similar.

# Appeals  

If an application is ineligible or incomplete, the applicant will receive a letter from the Illinois EPA stating such. The regulations for the EV Rebate Program provide for appeal to the Director of the Illinois EPA of an Illinois EPA decision denying a rebate application. See the requirements for an appeal in 35 Ill. Adm. Code 275.250. An appeal must be postmarked within 30 days after the date of mailing of the denial. Per Illinois regulations, appeals must specify which provisions of 35 Ill. Adm. Code 275 (‘Part 275’) the applicant alleges that the Agency did not properly apply and an explanation of how the Agency misapplied them. Also per regulations, the Director can only reverse a rebate denial if the applicable procedures and requirements in Part 275 were indeed misapplied by the Agency. He cannot reverse a denial for other reasons based on an individual’s personal circumstances. Note also that the Agency does not have the ability to change or disregard statutory or regulatory requirements, including the requirement that an application must be postmarked within 90 days of vehicle purchase.
