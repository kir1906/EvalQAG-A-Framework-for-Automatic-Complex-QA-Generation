 ## Summary : 
 Duke Energy is seeking interested school districts to participate in a
forthcoming EV School Bus program. Under this program, Duke Energy will
provide charging infrastructure for EV school buses and partial funding for
bus deployment. Exact timing of deployments is subject to additional funding
opportunities; therefore, at this time, the company is seeking districts
replacing buses in 2024 that have an interest in deploying EV school buses.

Up to $197,000 in funding will be provided for each school bus and associated
infrastructure. Duke Energy will own the charger and infrastructure. Buses
will participate in a vehicle-to-grid demonstration and study.
