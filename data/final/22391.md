Re: Application of Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC for Approval of Proposed Electric Transportation Pilot and An Accounting Order to Defer Capital and Operating Expenses Docket No. 2018-321-E  

Dear Ms. Boyd:  

Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC ("DEC") appreciated the opportunity to have presented information to the Commission on its application for approval of its proposed Electric Transportation ("ET") Pilot during the allowable ex parte briefing held on December 11, 2019. DEC files this letter to propose one modification to its pending ET Pilot application and to notify the Commission that it believes the pilot is ready for Commission action.  

One of the four programs proposed as part of DEC's ET Pilot is the Residential Electric Vehicle ("EV") Charging Utility Management Program (" Residential Charging Program"). As described in the application, the Residential Charging Program as proposed would have allowed DEC to "collect usage characteristics of EV charging behavior, better understand potential grid and utility impacts from EV charging, and implement utility-managed charging."'n reaching out to potential vendors as related to the proposed Residential Charging Program, DEC learned that the prospective vendors offered compatibility with only a single type of technology, which would limit customer options and their ability to participate in the program. In order to maximize customer choice, DEC proposes to modify its proposal such that— instead of directly controlling residential EV chargers— DEC will collect customer charging data and issue requests to participating customers to reduce or curtail charging. This modified approach will allow customers to use any Level 2 EV charger, which will increase participation, reduce charging station costs, enhance customer autonomy, and reduce complexity for DEC's administration of the program.

A redlined tariff showing changes from that which was proposed with the original application filed on October 10, 2018 is attached hereto, along with a clean version of the proposed tariff. With this program modification, and the opportunity to have shared additional information on the ET Pilots with the Commission at the recent allowable ex parte briefing, DEC believes that the ET Pilot, as amended, is ready for Commission action. While Duke Energy Progress, LLC did not propose a Residential Charging Program and therefore will not be seeking a modification, its amended application for approval of an ET Pilot filed in Docket No. 2018-322-E is also ready for Commission action.  

Kind regards

# RESIDENTIAL EV CHARGING PROGRAM (SC PILOT)  

# PURPOSE  

The purpose of this residential pilot program is to support the installation of Level 2 (L2) electric vehicle supply  equipment (EVSE) to collect utilization characteristics of electric vehicle (EV) charging behavior, better understand potential grid and utility impacts from EV charging, and investigate the ability for direct management of residential EV charging load.  Participants must grant Company access to all vehicle charging data throughout the program term and allow Company load management capability of vehicle charging during certain hours of the day.  

# AVAILABILITY  

This Program is available on a voluntary basis, at Company’s sole option, to no greater than 400 residential customers receiving electric service from Company under Schedules RS, RE, ES, RT or RB.  Participants shall submit an Application and must own, lease or otherwise operate on a regular basis a plug-in electric vehicle intended for use on public streets and highways.  A plug-in vehicle includes plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles.  Additionally, Customer must provide proof of purchase and installation of an approved L2 EVSE.  This program shall end on and after thirty-six (36) months following the initial effective date of the program. Customer shall maintain and provide the Company access to vehicle charging dataEVSE connectivity throughout the 36 month term of the program for purposes of load management and monitoring the electrical characteristics of the charging equipment.  

# PROGRAM CHARGING STATION EQUIPMENT  

A list of approved EVSE with appropriate communications and control capabilities will be available from the Company or its website. The Level 2 charging station equipment installed by the customer shall be UL-certified and connected to a dedicated single-phase 208- 240 volt circuit with an amperage rating of 20 amps or greater. The Charging Station equipment must include revenue-grade metrology with Wi-Fi, Cellular, or other communications to a central server along with charging capacity/curtailment capabilities. The EVSE must communicate with a network management system and be certified under the Open Charge Point Protocol (Version 1.6 or later).  The equipment must be certified as OpenADR 2.0b to interpret Company’s communication signals and manage charging.  Company shall have the right to request customers reduce charging speeds, up to and including full curtailment for periods up to 60 minutes, to assess load characteristics and customer behavior in connection with EV charging load management programs. Customer shall have the right to opt-out of individual load management events; however, opting-out of greater than three (3) events in a month will result in ineligibility from that month’s incentive paymentmay result in dismissal from the program. Dismissal may result in early termination charges, as described below.  

# PARTICIPATION INCENTIVE  

Applications will be considered on a first-come-first-served basis from the date and time of submittal.  Upon acceptance of the Customer’s Application and verification that the CustomerL2 EVSE has been properly enrolledinstalled, Customer shall receive a one-time rebate of $\$500$ per charging station.  A residential customer is only eligible for a single rebate.  

# MONTHLY RATE  

The EVSE shall be installed on Customer’s side of Company’s meter; therefore, any usage will be billed under the applicable residential schedule and other riders, if applicable, for the Billing Demand and kilowatt-hours registered or computed by or from Company’s metering facilities during the current month.  The following quarterly payment shall be remitted by Company to Customer by check,  or direct deposit, or gift card during the pilot period:  

Quarterly Load Control Payment $\$41.61$ per Customer  

# CONTRACT TERM AND EARLY TERMINATION  

The Contract Period shall be thirty-six months following the initial effective date of the program. Customer’s subscription is not transferrable to another party.  If Customer transfers their electric service to a different location within Company’s service territory, the subscription shall be transferred to the new service location upon re-installation of the Charging Station.  If Customer discontinues electric service and relocates outside the Company’s service territory or otherwise discontinues use of the Charging Station within twelve (12) months of initial participation, Customer shall remit to Company a Termination Payment equal to the One-Time Rebate plus the sum of all Monthly Load Control Credits received.  All quarterly payments to Customer shall cease and the Termination Payment by Customer shall also apply should the Customer fail to fulfill the terms of this program, including but not limited to maintaining connectivity.  

# GENERAL  

In addition to the usage recording capabilities of the charging station equipment, Company shall have the right to install at its own expense additional metering and load research devices as it deems appropriate to collect the usage characteristics of the electric vehicle charging station equipment.
