 ## Summary : 
 **Note: Initial application round to end on March 28, 2024, and additional
rounds expected in summer/fall of 2024, 2025, and 2026.**

In early February 2024, Governor Janet Mills announced the availability of
$4.4 million in federal funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)
that will be funneled as grants through the Maine Grid Resilience Program. The
grants support the use/construction of distributed energy resources for
enhancing system resiliency during disruptive events, including battery
storage subcomponents and microgrids, among other uses. Eligible entities for
the application include electric grid operators, storage operators,
electricity generators, distribution providers, fuel suppliers, and utilities,
among others determined by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Energy storage systems, including batteries, are allowed if the system is used
to improve grid resilience during disruptive events. Co-located storage
systems may be allowed, and any equipment integrated a battery into a solar
system is likely an allowable expense
