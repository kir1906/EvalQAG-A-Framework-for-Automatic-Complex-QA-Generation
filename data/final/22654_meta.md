 ## Summary : 
 Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) is a financing mechanism that enables
low-cost, long term funding for qualified improvements, including energy
efficiency, renewable energy, and water conservation projects. C-PACE is
specific to commercial, large multifamily (5+), industrial, and nonprofit
properties. Passed in 2020, the Washington C-PACER bill ([H.B.
2405](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=2405&Year=2019)) included
**resiliency**("R")**** measures, such as seismic improvements and fire/flood
protection. The bill authorizes counties to establish and administer C-PACER
financial programs.

Currently, the following seven counties in Washington have adopted C-PACER
ordinances: [Clark](https://clark.wa.gov/community-development/c-pacer),
[King](https://kingcounty.gov/legacy/services/environment/stewardship/sustainable-
building/pace.aspx), [Pierce](https://www.piercecountywa.gov/7692/C-PACER),
[Snohomish](https://snohomishcountywa.gov/6213/C-PACER),
[Spokane](https://www.spokanecounty.org/5194/Spokane-County-C-PACER-Program),
