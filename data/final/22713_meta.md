 ## Summary : 
 Puerto Rico has established a target to reduce electricity consumption by 30%
from 2019 levels by 2040. This amounts to a reduction of 4,744 GWh of
electricity consumption per year.

This goal can be reached using several different measures:

  1. PREPA-run or PREPA-facilitated energy efficiency programs
  2. Energy efficiency programs and actions in governmental buildings
  3. Savings resulting from the adoption of new building energy codes adopted after 2019, or increased compliance with building energy codes
  4. Savings resulting from incremental federal or Commonwealth appliance energy efficiency standards adopted after 2019
  5. Energy efficiency in non-governmental buildings resulting from actions funded by federal or Commonwealth government funds, such as low-income weatherization programs, Community Development Block Grants, disaster recovery or hazard mitigation funds, or other such programs
  6. Other sources as the Energy Bureau may identify and include in its assessment of progress
