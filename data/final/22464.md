2) the company must be registered as a Community Energy Facility in the system.

Please fill out one User Registration Form for each person who will file applications and fill out one Company Registration Form. E-mail the completed forms to DelafileAdmin@delaware.gov (mailto:DelafileAdmin@delaware.gov) . PSC Staff will set up the users and companies in the DelaFile E-filing system.
