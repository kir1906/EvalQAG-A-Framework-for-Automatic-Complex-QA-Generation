 ## Summary : 
 [H.B.
5028](https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2023-2024/publicact/htm/2024-PA-0068.htm),
enacted in June 2024, declares that any provision within a homeowners'
associations agreement that prohibits or has the effect of prohibiting the
installation of a solar energy system is invalid and unenforceable as contrary
to public policy. The law provides similar protections for the installation
of:

  * Clotheslines
  * Air source heat pumps
  * Ground source heat pumps
  * Insulation
  * Rain barrels
  * Reflective roofing
  * Energy efficient appliances
  * Solar water heaters
  * Electric vehicle supply equipment
  * Energy-efficient windows
  * Energy-efficient insulation materials

The bill also directs each homeowners’ association in this state to adopt a
written solar energy policy statement. The statement may not result in a
reduction in the production of electricity by the solar energy system by more
than 10% or increase the total cost of the installation of the solar energy
system to the member by more than $1,000.00.

A member who wants to install a solar energy system in the member’s home or
unit shall submit a written application to the homeowners’ association. A
homeowners’ association must approve or deny the member’s request to install a
solar energy system within 30 days after receipt of the written application.
The bill also specifies that a member may bring a civil action against the
homeowners’ association for damages. If the member prevails in an action
brought under this act, the court may award reasonable attorney fees and the
costs incurred in bringing the action.
