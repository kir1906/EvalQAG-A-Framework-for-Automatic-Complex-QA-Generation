Whether you own or operate a single vehicle or a group of vehicles for commercial purposes, incorporating Electric Vehicles (EVs) into your commercial or fleet operations can generate environmental and economic benefits.  

Commercial EVs can save businesses 30 to 60 percent in fuel expenses compared to conventional vehicles. This projection is based on electricity being the primary source of energy with no reliance on fossil fuels which are subject to price volatility. It does not cost as much to operate and maintain EVs because they have simpler drivetrains with fewer parts. Oil changes and other regularly required maintenance are not needed, and EVs do not make a lot of noise, creating a smoother driving experience. EVs also can help businesses reduce greenhouse gas emissions, achieve sustainability goals, and improve brand reputation and customer perception.  

Whether EVs are a viable solution for your needs today or in a few years, Cleco is Energizing Your Tomorrow with EVs and committed to providing comprehensive support and tailored solutions. Start your informed decision-making here and let's drive your business toward lower operating costs while achieving a cleaner, greener and more sustainable future.  

To help make your business' electrification journey easy and accessible, Cleco is offering   
FREEfleet assessments and up to $\$3,500$ in incentives to commercial customers for EV chargers and forklift equipment. The table below provides the specific dollar   
amounts. Click here to apply and view terms and conditions. Federal grants also are
