 ## Summary : 
 **_Note: The[Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf#page=993)
created the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/) with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

Wisconsin announced awardees for the first round of funding for its NEVI
program in May 2024. This round of funding allocated approximately $23.3
million to 53 locations across the state. Details on further rounds of funding
are not currently available. More details on Wisconsin's NEVI process can be
found in the [Wisconsin Electric Vehicle Infrastructure
Plan](https://wisconsindot.gov/Documents/projects/multimodal/2023weviplanupdatefinal.pdf).
