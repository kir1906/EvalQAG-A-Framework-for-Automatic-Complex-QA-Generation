2025 Program Update: The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a 5-year extension to the Level 2 Commercial Electric Vehicle Charging Program (L2 Program) and Public Benefit Charging Program (PB Program), components of the EVsmart Charging Programs. The extension includes changes to the program to better serve commercial electric rate customers with EV charging projects in PECO service territory. The program handbook has been updated to include the following changes:  

Update the L2 Program incentive limit to an annual incentive maximum of $\$60,000$ per customer and $\$200,000$ for Transit Authorities. Remove the make ready allocations for the L2 Program and provide rebates of $\$3,000$ per charging port for projects located in an Environmental Justice Area and $\$2,000$ per charging port for projects located anywhere else in the PECO electric service territory; and Expand the requirement for participating customers to provide data from their EV chargers to include all EV chargers located at the premises for which the incentives are issued and permit PECO, in its sole discretion, to waive this requirement for pre-existing EVSE where requiring data from that pre-existing EVSE would create hardship for the customer.  

# Section 1:  EVsmart Charging Program Overview  

PECO is working together with our customers and communities on many carbon emissions reduction efforts as part of our Path to Clean.  As vehicle emissions present one of the most significant air quality challenges for Pennsylvania, PECO is prioritizing investment in the construction and deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  

PECO's EVsmart offerings include two pilot programs designed to incentivize the installation of electric vehicle supply equipment (“EVSE”): (1) the Level 2 Commercial Electric Vehicle Charging Program (the “L2 Program”) and (2) the Public Benefit Charging Program (the “Public Benefit Program”). Both programs offer incentives for customer-owned charging stations that are used to charge electric vehicles $\big(^{\prime\prime}\mathsf{E V S}^{\prime\prime}\big)$ predominantly within the PECO electric service territory. Unless extended, the EVsmart Charging Programs will end May 31, 2029.  

# EVsmart Program Eligibility Overview  

Qualifying customers will submit one application per project through the online portal at peco.com/EV for either the Public Benefit Program or L2 Program. PECO and its program administrator, the Center for Sustainable Energy $\{^{\prime\prime}{\mathsf{C S E}}^{\prime\prime}\}$ , will review the application and confirm eligibility. Rebates are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Projects are required to be completed within 270 days of the rebate reservation award. See Table 1 for EVsmart Program Eligibility Criteria.  

Single customers are eligible for up to $\$60,000$ in total rebates each year through the EVsmart Program. All affiliates under common ownership or control are considered to be a single customer.

Specific details regarding the Public Benefit Program and L2 Program are further described in the sections below.  

# Public Benefit Program Rebate Overview  

Public Benefit Program incentives are capped at $50\%$ of the cost of equipment, installation, and make ready work for the project and consideration would be given to any applicable governmental grant or tax credits. Level 2 chargers and Direct Current Fast Chargers $\big(^{\prime\prime}\mathsf{D C F C s}^{\prime\prime}\big)$ are eligible for rebates.  

EVSE must be networked to provide two years of charging data to PECO after installation1. Data sharing requirements include all EVSE located at the premises for which the incentives are issued. PECO, in its sole discretion, can waive this requirement for pre-existing EVSE where requiring data from that preexisting EVSE would create hardship for the customer.  

Transit authorities installing DCFCs with a capacity of at least 250 kW per Charging Port are subject to a maximum incentive of $\$200,000$ per project site. All other eligible customers are subject to a maximum incentive of $\$60,000$ each year, over the duration of the Pilot, inclusive of incentives paid through both the L2 Program and the Public Benefit Program. Refer to Public Benefit Program Applicant Eligibility and Responsibilities for details on eligibility criteria.  

PECO Level 2 Commercial Electric Vehicle Charging Pilot Rebate Overview  

The PECO Level 2 Commercial EV Charging Pilot program provides rebates for the installation of new qualifying Level 2 EV chargers at sites with non-residential PECO electric service.  

EVSE must be networked to provide two years of charging data to PECO after installation. Data sharing requirements include all EVSE located at the premises for which the incentives are issued. PECO, in its sole discretion, can waive this requirement for pre-existing EVSE where requiring data from that preexisting EVSE would create hardship for the customer.  

The base rebate amount is $\$2,000$ per Charging Port. For projects located in Environmental Justice Areas, we offer an enhanced rebate of $\$3,000$ per Charging Port. All affiliates under common ownership or control are considered to be a single customer.  

Tax credits and other governmental incentives such as those offered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection $\langle^{\prime\prime}\mathsf{D}\mathsf{E}\mathsf{P}^{\prime\prime}\rangle$ through their Driving PA Forward and Alternative Fuel Incentive Grant programs can be combined with this rebate as long as all incentives do not exceed the total project costs2.

# Section 3: Application Process and Assistance  

In this section, the rebate application process is listed in four steps.  For assistance with rebate applications, email PECOEV@energycenter.org or call 484-816-8882. The online application can be found at peco.com/EV, under the Commercial Charger Rebate tile.  

Step 1: Program Applicant reviews program information and determines their program eligibility. Step 2:  Program Applicant submits Rebate Reservation Request Application prior to breaking ground on the site or incurring costs for work on the project. Step 3:  PECO notifies Program Applicant that rebate funds have been reserved for their application. Step 4:  Program Applicant completes project and submits Rebate Redemption Form no more than 270 days after notification of rebate funds reserved.  

# Step 1: Review Program Information and Determine Eligibility  

Interested applicants should plan to review all program information and determine their eligibility for either the L2 or Public Benefit Program prior to submitting their rebate application.  Figure 1 illustrates the eligible customer and project types for each program and eligibility requirements are further described in Section 4 and Section 5.  

![](images/1d769acf63ca84bd2b497d787400922de550e1d3d1dac3cb1ad35f942016853a.jpg)  
Figure 1: Determining EVsmart Program Eligibility  

# Step 2: Submit Rebate  

# Reservation Request Application  

PECO’s EVsmart Charging Rebates can be applied for using a single online application at peco.com/EV. The information from this application will be used by CSE and PECO to determine which program the project falls under:  

# Rebate Reservation Request  

Applicants should have the following documents and information available to complete the online form:  

• A recent PECO bill for the project site OR the PECO customer name, account number, and service address of the project site.   
• Preliminary project details (e.g., number of charging stations/ports you plan to install, planned charger model, planned network provider, cost estimates, and planned installation date).  

Applicants should submit their applications before incurring costs and within 270 days of completion. Project costs for PB Program applicants incurred before receiving notification of rebate reservation will not be eligible costs.  The rebate reservation period is 270 days, so interested applicants should not submit a reservation request more than 270 days prior to their expected EVSE energization date.  

Reservation requests will be reviewed by CSE staff in the order they were received, and funding will be reserved on a first-come, first-served basis.  If PECO or CSE requires additional information to determine an application’s eligibility, the applicant will receive an email requesting the information.  If the information is not received by the deadline in the email, the application will not be determined as ineligible and will be cancelled.  Applicants can reapply, and their new application will be processed in the order it was received.  

Final calculated rebate amounts cannot be larger than the amount confirmed in the rebate reservation confirmation even if additional Charging Ports were installed.  Once rebate funds have been reserved for an application, the applicant may request to decrease but may not increase the reserved rebate funding amount.  If an applicant wishes to increase their rebate amount, they will need to reapply and cancel the previous application.  

If an application is determined as ineligible, it will be cancelled, and the applicant will be sent an email notification.  

# Step 3:  Receive Notification of Reservation & Complete Project  

If the reservation request meets program eligibility requirements, and rebate funding is available, funds will be reserved for the application and CSE will send a notification of the rebate reservation via email.  

The full EVSE installation must be energized, and the Rebate Redemption Form submitted within 270 days of reservation award. CSE will send email reminders to applicants at 90, 60, and 30 days prior to project deadline.  

# Step 4: Submit Rebate Redemption Form  

Once the project is energized and initial charging data is available to export, please submit a Rebate Redemption Form at the following link:  

# Rebate Redemption Form  

Applicants should have the following documents available to complete the online form:  

• Completed Cost Submission Template (Public Benefit Program Only)   
• Completed Equipment Details Template Proof of equipment costs and total project costs (e.g., invoices) Photo(s) of the EV charger installation site showing all the chargers installed as part of the project   
• IRS Form W-9 (if incentive recipient is not a corporation or government entity)   
• Rebate Recipient Template (if rebate is to be paid to someone other than the PECO Custome  

If a Rebate Redemption Form is not received within 270 days of notification of the reservation award, the award may be cancelled, and the rebate funds will be released back into the pool for other applications.  

All required documentation must be provided, and your Network Service Provider must successfully transfer all required data from each Charging Port to confirm the project’s eligibility for the rebate.  CSE will review and verify all submitted information and data transfer(s).  

If PECO or CSE requires additional information or updated documents, the applicant will receive an email requesting the information with a deadline.  If the information is not received by the deadline in the email, the application may be cancelled, and funds will be released back into the funding pool for other applications.  

# Applicants are encouraged to communicate progress with CSE as CSE has the discretion to grant additional time to the applicant to provide the required updated information and/or documents.  

Once the applicant provides all information and documents required to demonstrate compliance with program requirements, CSE will approve the application and will provide an email notification of the final rebate amount.  Once approved, a rebate check will be mailed to the mailing address provided on the Rebate Redemption Form, generally within 60 days.  

# Application Assistance  

Applicants needing assistance with their application can email PECOEV@energycenter.org or call 484- 816-8882.  Normal hours of operation for assistance are Monday to Friday from 11:00 AM to 7:00 PM Eastern.

# Attachment 1. Terms and Conditions for EVsmart Charging Pilot Program  

Program Rules for the EVsmart Charging Pilot Program (the “Pilot”), including but not limited to, eligibility, rebate amounts, rebate limits, the application process, and data requirements are defined in the EVsmart Charging Pilot Program Handbook.  Subject to any necessary regulatory approvals, PECO expressly reserves the right to extend, modify (this includes modification of program rebate levels), or terminate this Pilot without prior or further notice to Participants.  

Funds Available:  The effective date of the EVsmart Charging Pilot (the “Pilot”) is April 1, 2022.  Applications are processed on a first-come, first-served basis, and rebate is subject to availability of funds.  “First-come, first-served" order is determined by the date and time the Rebate Reservation Request has been submitted and is received into PECO’s system.  

“Project Site” is the facility at which the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (“EVSE”) will be installed and operated.  

“Customer” is the holder of the PECO electric service account under which the EVSE is connected to the PECO electric distribution grid.  For purposes of rebate caps, all persons or legal entities that, directly or indirectly, now or hereafter, own or control, are owned or controlled by, or are under common ownership or control of the company at issue, where “control” means at least a fifty percent $(50\%)$ ownership interest, will be considered a single Customer.  

“Application Manager” is the individual person and/or organization who takes primary responsibility to manage an application for a rebate.  It is the Application Manager’s responsibility to ensure PECO has current and accurate contact information for all Participants at all times from the date the Rebate Reservation Request was submitted through 180 days after Rebate Redemption approval.  

“Rebate Recipient” is any third party designated by the Customer to receive the rebate.  The Rebate Recipient is responsible for confirming information about where the approved rebate should be delivered such as the mailing address.  Only the Customer can designate a third party as the Rebate Recipient and is the only party who can authorize changes to which party is designated as the Rebate Recipient.  

“Participant(s)” are, collectively, the Customer, Application Manager, and Rebate Recipient.  These roles may all be filled by different organizations, by a single organization, or any combination.  For example, the Customer could designate an EVSE equipment owner that has a site hosting agreement with the Customer as the Rebate Recipient and a contractor firm hired to do the work and manage the project as the Application Manager.  

Authority to Install Equipment:  Participant(s) represent that they have the authority to operate and install the EVSE at the Project Site or have obtained the permission of the legal owner of the Project Site, for said construction Project.  Participant(s) shall, at their own expense, obtain and maintain all licenses and permits needed to construct and complete the Project.  

Project Site EVSE:  All EVSE that is listed by the Participant(s) in the Rebate Redemption application as the basis for the calculation of the rebate amount must provide EVSE Data to PECO.  

EVSE Data:  Participant(s) agree to provide PECO with data from every Project Site EVSE charging session (the “EVSE Data”) and authorize PECO to collect the EVSE Data from the EVSE network services provider identified by the Participant(s) in the Rebate Redemption application, as well as from any successor network service provider identified by the Participant(s) subsequent to receipt of the rebate, for a period of two (2) years after installation of the EVSE.  Participant(s) understand that any rebate payments are contingent upon their compliance with all program rules relating to the provision of EVSE Data.  

Permission to Use Data:  Participant(s) grant PECO, its agents and representatives the unrestricted right to store, access, and use all information and EVSE Data collected as part of the Pilot for program administration, regulatory reporting, ordinary business use, industry forums, case studies, or other similar activities, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  PECO will not publicly disclose Customer-identifiable EVSE Data unless ordered to do so by a court of law or the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.  

Research Participation:  PECO may request Participant(s) to take part in surveys and other research efforts that support Pilot goals.  

# Attachment # 1.  Terms and Conditions for PECO EVsmart Charging Pilot  

Disclosure of Other Incentives:  Participant(s) understand that other rebates, grants, and financial rebates are “Other Incentives” and that all anticipated Other Incentives must be disclosed to PECO as part of the Application before payment of the rebate will be made.  

Additional Documentation & Inspections:  PECO reserves the right to request additional supporting documentation necessary to verify compliance with the Pilot rules.  Participant(s) authorize PECO to have reasonable access to their property to inspect the installation and performance of the equipment and installations that are eligible for a rebate under the guidelines of the Pilot.  The rebate payment may be denied by PECO if these conditions are not met by Participant(s) within the communicated time.  

PECO, its agents, measurement and verification contractor, and/or the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission have the right to audit or inspect all projects to verify compliance with the program rules and verify the accuracy of project documentation.  This may include pre-installation and/or post-installation inspections, metering, data collection, interviews, and utility bill data analyses.  Participant(s) must allow PECO access to project documents and the facility where the measures were installed for a period of five years after receipt of rebate payment.  

Rebate Payment:  Payment will normally be made within 60 days subsequent to PECO receiving and approving a Redemption Request with all required documentation. However, should a Project be completed in a calendar year prior to the installation date identified in the Rebate Reservation Request, PECO reserves the right to defer payment until the calendar year for which the rebate was reserved.  PECO reserves the right to modify or cancel the rebate if the actual EVSE or installation of the EVSE does not meet the Pilot guidelines or if the documents submitted fail to meet the requirements of the Pilot.  

No Escheatment:  PECO and its Program Administrator shall make commercially reasonable efforts to convey payment of any rebate to the Rebate Recipient identified in the Application.  Should the Rebate Recipient fail to accept/deposit the payment within 180 days of the first attempt to make payment, PECO reserves the right to cancel the Application and to release any previously reserved rebate funding.  

Taxes:   Participant(s) are responsible for any taxes associated with the receipt of a rebate Payment.  It shall be the sole responsibility of the Participant(s) to seek professional advice and determine the tax consequences of the rebate.  

Compliance:  Participant(s) are responsible for meeting program requirements and complying with all government, property owners, homeowner’s association, or other requirements regarding restrictions, codes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning the EVSE installation.  

Maintenance:  Participant(s) are responsible, at their sole cost and expense, for all actions related to the testing, maintenance, repair, and replacement of the EVSE and of the facilities in which the EVSE is located.

The Participant(s) shall collaborate with PECO to prepare any press release and to plan for any news conference concerning work related to the Pilot.  In addition, the Participant(s) shall notify PECO at a minimum of five (5) business days prior to any media interview in which work related to this Pilot is referred to or discussed.  Notification to PECO shall be made via email to EV@peco.com.  

Termination or Suspension:  PECO may terminate, or for any duration suspend, Participant(s)’ involvement in the Pilot, with or without cause, at any time, and for any reason.  Such reasons may include but are not limited to failure to abide by Pilot terms and conditions, permitting issues, environmental concerns, submission of falsified documents or unauthorized signatures, illegal actions, or any other reason(s) that Participant(s)’ continued involvement is not in the best interests of the Pilot or PECO.  

No Third-Party Beneficiaries:  These Terms and Conditions are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any other persons other than Participant(s) and PECO.  

Assignment:  No Participant shall assign its rights or delegate its duties without the prior written consent of PECO. Any such assignment or delegation without the prior written consent of PECO or its assignee, if any, shall be null and void.  All Participants must provide assurance of the success of a Project if assigned by providing any additional information requested by PECO.  In the event an EVSE installation is turned over to a new owner/operator before Participant(s) have provided two-years of EVSE Data to PECO, Participant(s) shall include in the agreement transferring control of the EVSE installation the new owner/operator’s obligation to continue to provide EVSE Data to PECO.

# Attachment 2. Frequently Asked Questions  

Please note, some answers apply to both the L2 Program and Public Benefit Program. Others will be specified by program. Other questions can be directed to PECOEV@energycenter.org.  

What level of charging is covered under each program?  

L2 Program – Only level 2 charging equipment is eligible for the L2 Program rebates.  

Public Benefit Program – Level 2 and DCFC equipment are eligible for the Public Benefit Program.  

I am unsure of which program I am applying for, what should I do?  

To make applications as simple as possible, all customers will complete the same Rebate Reservation Request application. PECO and CSE will determine which program customers are eligible for and receive rebates from. Programs that are ineligible for the Public Benefit Program will be reviewed for the L2 Program. If ineligible for either program, customers will be notified.  

# What are the rebate amounts for each program?  

L2 Program - The base rebate amount is the lesser of $\$2,000$ per Charging Port. For projects located in EJAs, we offer an enhanced rebate of up to $\$3,000$ per Charging Port.  

Public Benefit Program - Public Benefit Program charging incentives are capped at $50\%$ of the cost of equipment, installation, and make ready work for the project and consideration would be given to any applicable governmental grant or tax credits. Transit authorities installing EV fast chargers with a capacity of at least $250~\mathsf{k W}$ per Charging Port are subject to a maximum incentive of $\$200,000$ per project site.  

All other eligible customers are subject to a maximum annual incentive of $\$60,000$ , inclusive of incentives paid through both the L2 Program and the Public Benefit Program.  

What is the maximum number of ports covered by the rebate?  

There is no cap on the number of chargers or ports. Applicants are subject to the annual rebate limits of $\$60,000$ per customer and $\$200,000$ for Transit Authorities.  

# What is an Environmental Justice Area?  

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection defines Environmental Justice Areas using more than 30 environmental, health, and socioeconomic indicators. EJAs are mapped on DEP’s PennEnviroScreen at gis.dep.pa.gov/PennEnviroScreen/.  See Attachment 3 for a guide to using the PennEnviroScreen.  

# What costs does the rebate cover?  

Refer to the Public Benefit Eligible Costs section for details on what costs are covered for each program. The L2 Program provides rebates of $\$2,000$ or $\$3,000$ per port and no longer requires project cost invoices to be submitted.  

Who is eligible for the Public Benefit Program rebates?  What charger uses are eligible?  

Program incentives are available to 501(c)(3) organizations, Public Transportation Services, Public Transit Authority, local government agencies, and publicly accessible EJA customers.  Possible uses for eligible projects include EV charging at workplaces, retail businesses, public charging, fleet charging, and multi-unit dwellings.  

# How do I apply for the rebate?  

The program has a 3-part application process.  Part 1: the Rebate Reservation Request, must be completed prior to beginning construction. Part 2: PECO and CSE will review your application and determine eligibility and the appropriate rebate reservation level.  Part 3: the Rebate Redemption form, will be done after the chargers are energized.  PECO is only accepting online applications for this program.  More information on the application process can be found in Section 3 of the Program Handbook.  

# When do the programs end?  

Unless extended, the programs will end May 31, 2029.  

# When should I submit my application?  

Applicants should submit their Rebate Reservation Request application before installation begins.  PECO rebates will only cover eligible costs incurred after the initial application.  The reservation period is limited to 270 days, so customers should apply within 270 days of planned installation completion.  

Does PECO have a list of EV chargers pre-approved for the program?  

The Rebate Reservation Request form includes the current list of eligible chargers.  However, the program is not limited to a pre-approved list of chargers.  Any EV supply equipment meeting the eligibility requirements identified in Section 4 and 5 of the Program Handbook is eligible for the program as long as they can meet the data submission requirements.  

# What if the chargers I’m planning to install are not on the list of eligible chargers?  

The Rebate Reservation Request form allows you to identify your preferred charger make and model. We will review your preferred charger and add it to the list of eligible chargers if it meets the eligibility requirements identified in Section 4 and 5 of the Program Handbook.  

How long do I have to complete construction?  

Applicants have 270 days from notification of reservation award to complete construction and submit their Rebate Redemption form.  

Who do I contact if I have a question about my application?  

For questions about an application that you already submitted, please contact pecoev@energycenter.org.  

# When will I receive the rebate?  

Based on approval of the documentation, applicants will receive the rebate within 60 days of an approved Rebate Redemption form including the following information:  

o Completed Cost Submission Template (Public Benefits Program Only)   
o Completed Equipment Details Template   
o Proof of total project costs (e.g., invoices) (Public Benefits Program Only)   
o Photo(s) of the EV charger installation site showing all of the chargers installed as part of the project   
o IRS Form W-9 (if incentive recipient is not a corporation or government entity)   
o Rebate Recipient Template (if rebate is to be paid to someone other than the PECO Customer)   
o Session data is provided by all chargers  

What if I don't already have electric service at the site where I am installing chargers?  

For new construction, you or your contractor must first submit a  for the site to PECO.  PECO will then issue a pending account number for that site which you can use to submit a Rebate Reservation Request application. To submit a service and meter application, go to peco.com/ServiceRequest.  

Can I get a rebate for EV chargers that I'm installing as part of a larger construction project?  

Yes, as long as the chargers are energized within the timeline of the rebate program.  The reservation period is limited to 270 days, so customers with energize dates farther out than that should hold off on applying for the incentive until they are within 270 days of energizing the project.  Please be aware that application must be submitted prior to beginning construction on the EV chargers.  

# What if I already have some EV chargers at the site?  

Applicants will be asked to provide data from all chargers at projects sites which are receiving rebates, including existing EVSEs. Program incentives are only provided for costs associated with new charging equipment added to the site.  Relocation or replacement of existing chargers is not eligible.  

# How will I provide data from my chargers to PECO?  For how long?  

Charger data will be delivered electronically to PECO and the Program Data Administrator by your network provider for a period of two (2) years after installation of the charger(s).  The program requires that your network provider has a Data Sharing Agreement with PECO and that you execute any data release required by your network provider.  

# What if my network provider is not already participating in the program?  

The Rebate Reservation Request form allows you to identify your preferred network provider and then we will contact them.  To participate, the network provider must enter into a data sharing agreement with PECO and implement an acceptable mechanism to transfer the required data to us.  Your project must utilize a Participating Network Provider to be eligible for a rebate.  Please refer to Section 4 and 5 of the Program Handbook for more information on network provider eligibility requirements.  

# Why does PECO need data from my chargers?  

PECO will use EV charging data to inform the Company’s future distribution system planning and rate design.  PECO will also provide aggregated EV charging data such as cumulative electricity consumption and typical load profiles of participating chargers to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (“PA PUC”) and interested stakeholders.  

# What information from the program will PECO publish?  

PECO will publish information about the pilot on peco.com and in other public forums including annual reports to the PA PUC and biannual progress updates for interested stakeholders.  These reports and updates will include rebate recipients' county and census tract as well as the aggregated number and/or dollar value of incentives paid.  The reports and updates will include aggregated charger data such as cumulative electricity consumption and typical load profiles of participating chargers, but they will not include customer-identifiable charger data.  

PECO may also provide confidential, non-public, reports to the PA PUC and/or regulatory stakeholders in which rebate recipients are identified by name and/or site address.  

What other incentives are available?  

Visit PECO's EV Toolkit for a listing of EV-related incentives and promotions.  In addition, you can visit dep.pa.gov/grants for information about the DEP’s grants, loans, and rebates, including the Alternative Fuel Incentive Grant and the Driving PA Forward program.
