We are proud to announce the successful conclusion of the MileageSmart program, which has helped more than 1,277 moderate to low-income Vermonters purchase high miles-per-gallon vehicles from local auto dealers. This pilot program has exceeded all expectations, with demand for incentives far surpassing initial projections.  

Since October 2020, MileageSmart partnered with Vermont Auto Dealers to make energy-efficient vehicles more accessible to lowincome families. Together, we achieved remarkable results, helping families invest in cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars, including:  

• 448 Electric Vehicles • 279 Plug-in Hybrids • 550 Hybrids  

The total value of these vehicles exceeds $\$23,5$ million, and participants have received average incentives of nearly $\$4,500$ per vehicle. This initiative not only reduced transportation costs for participants but also supported Vermont’s goals for a cleaner environment and reduced carbon emissions.  

With all available funds now disbursed, the MileageSmart program has come to an end, and no further applications can be processed. We are grateful to everyone involved for making this program such a success, especially the Vermont Auto Dealers and participants who embraced this opportunity for a more sustainable future.  

Thank you to everyone for your interest in purchasing energy-efficient vehicles and for contributing to a greener Vermont.
