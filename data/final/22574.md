# § 7602. Code for Energy Conservation.  

(a) Except as herein noted, county and municipal building and plumbing codes shall meet the most recent version of the International Code Council (ICC), International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) within 12 months of adoption by the Delaware Energy Office. In effect, the highest available energy conservation code of the ICC/IECC as adopted by the Delaware Energy Office shall be the minimum energy code for all new detached 1- and 2-story family dwellings and all other new residential buildings 3 stories or less in height. Energy standards for all other new buildings, to include high-rise residential, shall be established to meet the latest available standard of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers/Illuminating Engineering Society (ASHRAE/IES ) as determined by the Delaware Energy Office; provided, however, the respective county or municipal governments may exclude agricultural structures from these provisions. The Delaware Energy Office shall adopt these updates pursuant to Chapter 101 of Title 29. However, local jurisdictions may adopt stretch codes based upon codes developed by national or international code authorities including the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the International Code Council (ICC) provided that no local jurisdiction may adopt a stretch code that would replace or supersede, in its entirety, the energy code most recently adopted by the Delaware Energy Office, unless the local jurisdiction initiates a formal administrative or regulatory process under the guidance of the Delaware Energy Office at least 6 months prior to adoption. Local jurisdictions may also, through an administrative or regulatory process, provide alternative compliance pathways to meet the provisions of the stretch code or stretch codes being adopted.  

(b) The Delaware Energy Office, or its successor, shall promulgate procedures for certification of compliance with these codes and standards to be utilized by respective local governments; provided, however, with respect to compliance with these codes and standards, for a commercial building of less than 5,000 square feet in size, the respective local government, rather than requiring that such compliance be certified by licensed engineers or architects, as is required with commercial buildings of 5,000 square feet or more, may elect to utilize a commercial buildings ASHRAE/IES Compliance Guide, to include computerized software compliance packages such as the Department of Energy developed COMcheck compliance software for insuring commercial energy code compliance and the Department of Energy developed REScheck compliance software for residential energy code compliance. An alternate compliance method for residential code compliance using ENERGY STAR documentation software may be used in lieu of the REScheck software. Code officials shall allow submission of documents that demonstrate energy efficiency that exceeds the requirements of the code when these state, local or national programs have been demonstrated to exceed the requirements of the code.  

(c) The Delaware Energy Office, or its successor, in consultation with the Green Building Council of the Home Builders Association of Delaware, shall establish programs to promote the construction of zero net energy homes. A “zero net energy home” or “zero net energy building” is defined as a residence or commercial building that, through the use of energy efficient construction, lighting, appliances and on-site renewable energy generation, results in zero net energy consumption from the utility provider. Therefore, a net zero energy capable home must be energy efficient enough that if the home or building owner chooses to add on-site generation, net zero energy consumption could be achieved. As of December 31, 2025, all new residential building construction in the State of Delaware shall be zero net energy capable. As of December 31, 2030, all new commercial building construction must also be zero net energy capable.  

(d) The Delaware Energy Office shall review the State Energy Code triennially for potential updates to the IECC energy code and ASHRAE energy code standard.  

(e) This section shall become effective on July 1, 2010.  

(f) From January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2010, sellers of new construction shall notify buyers of an option to purchase the construction built to the ICC/IECC 2009 code standard.  

(g) The Delaware Energy Office will conduct energy code training work shops for code officials, builders, architects, and engineers prior to July 1, 2010.

# § 7603. Lighting efficiency standards for new and existing buildings [Repealed].  

Repealed by 70 Del. Laws, c. 72, § 1, effective June 23, 1995.  

# § 7604. Refrigerants; state and local code.  

No provision of the Delaware building code or other local code may prohibit or otherwise limit the use of a refrigerant designated as acceptable for use pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 7671k, provided any equipment containing such refrigerant is listed and installed in accordance with safety standards and use conditions imposed for that equipment or refrigerant.  

84 Del. Laws, c. 88, § 1 (https://legis.delaware.gov/SessionLaws?volume=84&chapter=88);  

# 7605. Solar-ready zone [For application of this section, see 84 Del. Laws, c. 143, § 2].
