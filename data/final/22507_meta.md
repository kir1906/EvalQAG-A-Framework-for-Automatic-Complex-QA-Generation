 ## Summary : 
 The Electric Vehicle Workplace Charing Station Loan Program is operated by the
Vermont Economic Development Authority (VEDA) working in conjunction with
Green Mountain Power (GMP). Electric vehicle charging stations are available
for profit or not-for-profit businesses, municipalities, or individuals owning
or leasing a business property to an otherwise eligible business and
installing a new EV Charging station(s). These include individuals, sole
proprietors, LLCs, corporations, cooperatives, not-for-profits, and
municipalities.

Eligible applications must be customers of GMP or another electric utility
with a similar EV charging station program that is acceptable to VEDA.
Eligible projects may include the purchase and installation of EV charging
equipment and connection to the utility.

The loan may fund up to 80% of the project cost at a max of $25,000. Interest
rates will be fixed at 4% for terms of 3 years and fixed at 5% for loans with
a longer term (max of up to 5 years).
