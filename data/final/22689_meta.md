 ## Summary : 
 [H.B.
910](https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb0910/?ys=2023rs),
enacted in May 2023, directed the Public Service Commission (PSC) to establish
energy storage procurement targets, with a goal of achieving:

  * 750 MW by the end of delivery year 2027
  * 1,500 MW by the end of delivery year 2030
  * 3,000 MW by the end of delivery year 2033

  

The PSC may adopt a smaller target if the above targets cannot be met cost
effectively. In which case, the PSC should adopt a target it deems to be the
maximum cost-effective amount of energy storage that can be deployed by the
end of the delivery year.

To meet the energy storage targets, the PSC is to establish an Energy Storage
Program consisting of a competitive procurement program. The Energy Storage
Program may also include a system of energy storage credits and market-based
incentives, a requirement for investor-owned utilities to install or contract
for energy storage projects or credits, or any other mechanism or policy the
PSC deems appropriate. The PSC is developing the Energy Storage Program in
[Case Number 9715](https://webpsc.psc.state.md.us/DMS/case/9715).
