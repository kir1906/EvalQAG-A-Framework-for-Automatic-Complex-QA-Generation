# Executive Summary  

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program is a federal program that distributes funding to states for the strategic deployment of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. The goal is to establish a national interconnected network across the country with public EV charging stations every 50 miles. States are responsible for building out their network using their formula funds as well as available grant funding to contribute to the national network. For an EV charging station to be considered NEVI-compliant, it must have four ports with 150 kilowatts of power per port, allow for open-access payment methods, be publicly available, and be located along designated Federal Highway Administration Alternative Fuel Corridors (AFCs). Additional operating requirements include $97\%$ reliability and data sharing requirements, among others. The details of the requirements are outlined in this document and summarized in the federal rule making (refer to Appendix B).  

Within Idaho, interstate AFCs are Interstate (I-)15, I-84, I-86, and I-90. Non-interstate AFCs are State Highway (SH-)1, SH-55, U.S. Route (US-)12, US-20, US-30, US-93, and US-95.  

Initially, existing sites were evaluated to determine which sites could be considered “Potentially NEVI Compliant” as was outlined in the NEVI State of Idaho 2024 Baseline Plan Update (IAWG 2023). Subsequently, through a data-driven approach and analysis of selected criteria, potential site locations were evaluated. Proposed site locations were confined to within 1 mile of identified AFCs where there was a potential EV charging site. Potential EV charging site locations were then prioritized using a data-driven process known as multi-objective decision analysis (MODA), a decision-making methodology that aids in selecting the best course of action when facing multiple objectives (Appendix A). As part of this process, public input was also incorporated as a data point in addition to geospatial data. Other criteria used in the MODA model ranged from existing condition to equity and public feedback, site effectiveness, and travel patterns each with a distinct weight for scoring. Specifically, the criteria used in the MODA model are as follows:  

Distance to non-NEVI-compliant stations   
 Low-income roadway users   
 Average daily traffic volume   
 Trip length   
 Area of interest   
 Disadvantaged and tribal communities Connectivity node   
 Distance to NEVI-compliant stations   
 Proximity to electrical substation Adjacent amenities  

Sites along AFCs were ranked, compared, and categorized into sites either as in the top 40 of the data-driven prioritizations (Figure ES-1) or as sites outside of the top 40. Based on the results of the top 40 analysis, a gap analysis was completed to determine where AFCs were not meeting the 50-mile spacing requirement. Additional sites were identified that would help achieve the fully built-out status of sites every 50 miles along each AFC.  

This study recommends three tiers of sites based on these results and the AFC priorities for Idaho. These tiers generally reflect the deployment approach (refer to Section 3). Tier 1 comprises the highest-scoring stations on interstate AFCs in Idaho, essential for achieving fully built-out status on the interstates. Tier 2 comprises other potential site locations on AFCs that are on U.S. routes and SH-55. Lastly, Tier 3 includes lower-scoring stations along more rural AFCs. This document outlines the approach for all three tiers in deploying EV charging sites to achieve fully built-out status according to federal guidelines and will be used to develop deployment processes that optimize available funding. However, it is recognized and acknowledged that achieving fully built-out status may not be feasible given the limited funds. Upon the installation of Round 1 sites, Round 2 sites will be strategically implemented at a later date based on updated criteria, including funding availability, as outlined in Section 3.  

An interactive StoryMap 1has been created to illustrate the methodology behind prioritizing EV charging sites. Divided into three sections of various maps, it encompasses “Considerations,” highlighting key existing criteria; “Equity & Public Feedback,” considering disadvantaged communities and public input; and “Site Effectiveness,” evaluating factors like adjacent amenities and connectivity nodes. The final set of  

maps, focusing on “Travel Patterns,” considers factors such as distance to existing EV stations, traffic volumes, and trip length. The StoryMap concludes with an interactive dashboard displaying scores, ranks, and detailed breakdowns of each site's criteria weight and data source for comprehensive insight.  

Additional considerations for this SFAS include considerations for seasonal patterns, resilience, and payment methods. Many of these considerations will be site-specific and recommended by the NEVI developer, but some general considerations are outlined in this study.

Following this study, a Request for Applications will be issued for the construction of two to three representative Round 1 sites. The Round 1 sites presented in the 2024 NEVI Plan (IAWG 2023) will be the first sites to use formula funds in the initial solicitation, and Round 2 site solicitation will be informed and perfected by the information gained by the Round 1 solicitation and implementation.

# 1. Introduction and Background  

# 1.1 NEVI Program and Technical Requirements  

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program is a federal program that distributes funding to states for the strategic deployment of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. Through the NEVI program, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) aims to establish a nationwide interconnected network to facilitate data collection, access, and reliability. Funding through the NEVI program can be used to cover costs for projects that include the following:  

The acquisition, installation, and network connection of EV charging stations to facilitate data collection, access, and reliability   
 Proper operation and maintenance of EV charging stations   
 Long-term EV charging station data sharing   
 Traffic control device or on-premises signage acquired Information on publicly available EV charging infrastructure locations, pricing, real-time availabili and accessibility through mapping applications  

Guidance from the Joint Office, composed of both the U.S Department of Transportation (USDOT) and the U.S Department of Energy (DOE), provides technical assistance on planning and implementing a national network of EV chargers. States have designated Alternative Fuel Corridors (AFCs) along national highway system corridors throughout the country. The goal of the NEVI program is a national interconnected network across the country with public EV charging stations every 50 miles. States are responsible for building out their network using their formula funds as well as available grant funding to contribute to the national network. For an EV charging station to be considered NEVI-compliant, it must have four ports with 150 kilowatts of power per port, allow for open-access payment methods, be publicly available, and be located along designated FHWA AFCs. Additional operating requirements include $97\%$ reliability and data sharing requirements, among others. The details of the requirements are outlined in this report and summarized in the federal rulemaking (Appendix B). Other technical requirements of NEVI for EV charging stations include the following:  

Each direct current fast charger (DCFC) station must have four combined charging system (CCS) Type 1 connectors. Other connecters, such as North American Charging Standard ports are allowed, provided the minimum CCS chargers are in place. Stations with DCFC charging ports are also allowed to have other nonproprietary connectors. Charging stations along designated AFCs intended to serve the users of designated AFCs are available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.   
Network connectivity requirements are met for charger-to-charger network communication, charging network-to-charging network communication, and charging network-to-grid communication.  

Examples of NEVI-compliant sites are shown on Figures 1-1 through 1-3.

The Interagency Work Group (IAWG), through federal guidelines and guidance, has collaboratively worked with state agencies and the public to establish a strategic deployment plan for an interconnected charging network within Idaho. The IAWG consists of the Governor’s Office of Energy and Mineral Resources (OEMR), the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD), and the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). The IAWG provided direction for the Siting, Feasibility, and Access Study (SFAS) to evaluate potential site locations, recommend potential sites, evaluate other feasibility factors, and develop recommendations for next steps.  

# 1.2 Alternative Fuel Corridors in Idaho  

AFCs are corridors designated by the federal government based on applications from each state to achieve a national interconnected EV charging network. As with station requirements, there are federal guidelines regarding AFCs. Within Idaho, AFCs were designated by the IAWG as critical corridors for EV charging infrastructure build-out. To qualify as NEVI-compliant, charging stations under the NEVI program must either be built along an AFC or be located no more than 1 mile from the nearest interchange exit or highway intersection along the corridor. For stations proposed under the NEVI program that do not fall under either category, an exception must be proposed by the state and approved by the FHWA.  

Within Idaho, interstate AFCs are Interstate (I-)15, I-84, I-86, and I-90. Non-interstate AFCs are State Highway (SH-)1, SH-55, U.S. Route (US-)12, US-20, US-30, US-93, and US-95. Through a data-driven approach and analysis of selected criteria, potential site locations were determined along these AFCs.  

Certain criteria, including existing EV charging locations, demographic data, and travel patterns, were considered for each potential site location. Based on scoring results for each potential site, sites along AFCs were ranked and categorized into three tiers. Tier 1 includes the recommended sites located along the interstate routes, as shown in blue on Figure 1-4. Tier 2 includes the recommended sites located along the highly used routes of US-95, US-93, US-12, and SH-55. Tier 3 includes recommended sites located along US-20, US-30, and SH-1, finalizing the “fully built-out” network within Idaho.

# 2. Approach to Evaluating Sites  

To guide the electrification in the state of Idaho, a transparent and data-driven approach was created to identify and prioritize potential EV charging site locations. Data-based criteria were chosen to evaluate and compare potential site locations. In this section of the SFAS, the details of this site evaluation process are defined in further detail.  

# 2.1 Input from Public and Stakeholders  

The first layer of information used in prioritization was feedback from past outreach efforts. Input regarding areas of interest was provided by Idaho residents during the development of the 2022 State of Idaho Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Baseline Plan (ITD 2022). Through a combination of public meetings and surveys, respondents were able to designate their high-priority locations for charging infrastructure. Responses were compiled and mapped as shown on Figure 2-1. Locations were selected by participants as areas of interest and include state highways, tourist destinations, and rural areas of interest. As shown on Figure 2-1 and 2-2, residents implied EV chargers would be useful around these areas of interest because of nearby surroundings and amenities. Other discussions emphasize the need for reliability and accommodation for vehicles that are not passenger vehicles.

# 2.2 Evaluation Method  

Beyond the public input, there were additional criteria/data sources to consider when evaluating potential sites. Potential EV charging site locations were prioritized using a process known as multi-objective decision analysis (MODA) (Appendix A). MODA is a decision-making methodology that aids in selecting the best course of action where multiple objectives and priorities are present. MODA is a shorthand term for a simplified variation known in decision analysis literature as multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT). The theory and practice of MAUT has advanced through the years and has wide application in many fields. The MODA process begins with defining and prioritizing objectives, identifying alternative action plans, and establishing criteria for evaluation. Then, through a quantitative analysis and tradeoff assessment and the incorporation of objective priorities, solutions are presented. Figure 2-3 is a graphic that describes the MODA process steps used to prioritize potential EV charging sites.

Figure 2-3. MODA Process Diagram  

# 2.3 Potential Sites Considered  

For the SFAS and the NEVI program, all potential site locations are confined to within 1 mile of identified AFCs. Figure 1-2 shows the AFCs in Idaho. Potential sites were identified by a visual inspection of aerial imagery along AFCs. Potential locations were selected at approximately 2.5-mile intervals where at least two of the following criteria was met:  

 Existing access off AFC (for example, interchange, exit ramp, intersection)   
 Existing commercial locations within 1 mile Adjacent land has size/capacity to fit a charging site  

Once potential locations were identified, they were grouped by route and assigned a unique identification number using a north to south precedence. Table 2-1 demonstrates the range of identification numbers for each route while Figure 2-4 shows all the locations analyzed within the state of Idaho.

# 2.4 Available Data  

Data were used in each step of the evaluation process for potential site hosts. Criteria were selected through the analysis of private and publicly available data sources as well as historical insights and guidance from subject matter experts. Data points were then chosen as indicators of success for potential charging site locations or indicators that could hinder the success of a charging station. Built from these data points, a list of potential criteria was generated, as shown in Table 2-2. Data for all potential site locations identified were collected and processed for these criteria. The data for each of these criteria were generated and analyzed within a geographic information system (GIS). These potential criteria were presented to the IAWG and refined to select the best indicators. This is further defined in Section 2.5.

# 2.5 Establishing Criteria and Relative Weighting  

A Data and Criteria Workshop was held on August 2, 2023, with the IAWG and Atlas, the public involvement consultants for the NEVI program. The agenda for the workshop is included in Appendix C. The workshop group worked collaboratively to define a statement for what success for the SFAS and NEVI program would look like and corresponding attributes. Using the collaborative purpose statement as well as feedback from the public on their priorities (further detailed in Section 2.1), the group individually reviewed each of the criterion listed in Table 2-2. The discussion for each criterion considered the following questions:  

 Does this criterion serve as an indicator in meeting the purpose statement?  How well is this criterion correlated to a successful outcome?  What does the distribution of the data for this criterion look like?  Does this criterion help achieve the priorities outlined by the public?  

The discussion led to the merging of some criteria, adjustment of analysis variables within GIS, and removal of extraneous criteria. Following the review and input from the workshop discussions, a list of finalized criteria was created. The next component of the workshop was an exercise to define relative importance between the selected criteria. This was facilitated using a technique called swing weighting. Swing weighting is a method for setting relative weights between criteria in an additive multi-attribute utility function. The final weighting scheme, shown in Table 2-3, was achieved by an average of all attendees’ responses.  

Table 2-3. SFAS Criteria and Weights   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Criteria Name</td><td>Weight</td></tr><tr><td>Distance to Non-NEVl-compliantStations</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>Low-income Roadway Users</td><td>8%</td></tr><tr><td>Average Daily Traffic Volume</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>Trip Length</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>AreaofInterest</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Disadvantaged and Tribal Communities</td><td>11%</td></tr><tr><td>Connectivity Node</td><td>11%</td></tr><tr><td>Distance toNEVl-compliantStations</td><td>12%</td></tr><tr><td>Proximity to Electrical Substation</td><td>12%</td></tr><tr><td>Adjacent Amenities</td><td>14%</td></tr></table></body></html>  

With the criteria and weighting scheme as inputs, the MODA tool calculated the utility/value expected for each potential site location. These calculated scores for each site location were then sorted from high to low to produce a ranked list of potential site locations. Locations that scored in the top 40 of all potential site locations were selected for further review. The goal of reviewing potential site locations in the top 40 was to remove locations within the same municipality (that is, if two locations in Coeur d’Alene were in the top 40, only one would be considered). This resulted in a list of 40 reviewed and unique locations across Idaho that scored the highest among selected criteria (Table 2-4). The selected 40 potential sites were then further analyzed to provide additional details including: local energy provider, if the site is located in a DAC, and if it is located in an area of interest based on the public feedback. These 40 locations were recommended to serve as the starting point to building out the EV charging network within Idaho.

# 2.6 50-mile Spacing Gap Analysis  

After reviewing the top 40 prioritized sites, each AFC was reviewed to determine which sites would facilitate fully built-out status, meaning a NEVI-compliant site every 50 miles along each AFC. A total of 39 sites were recommended, 29 of which were high-priority sites ranked in the top 40 based on the data analysis and 10 of which were not highly ranked but fulfilled a geographic requirement.  

It was noted that many of the sites that fulfill only the geography requirement may require more significant federal funding to subsidize capital and operating costs to make the site economically viable.  

The results of this analysis can be found in Section 3.  

# 2.7 StoryMap and Results Dashboard  

An online, interactive StoryMap2 has been created and published for the public to visualize the pertinent project data. The StoryMap highlights the process and methodology used for the site prioritization process. The maps identified were used as criteria for scoring potential site locations.  

The first aspect of the StoryMap is “Considerations,” which is broken down into three maps that depict essential requirements for NEVI-compliant stations. Within this section, the “Alternative Fuel Corridors” (AFCs) map highlights the state nominated AFCs within Idaho in blue and neighboring states AFCs in gray. The “Locations Analyzed” map visualizes potential site locations as dots on the identified AFCs, and the ”Existing EV Chargers” map demonstrates DCFC and non-DCFC stations as different colored circles on identified AFCs. These criteria helped assess the status of AFCs in relation to federal requirements, serving as an initial step in identifying necessary actions and prioritizing tasks to attain a fully built-out status.  

The second aspect of the StoryMap is “Equity & Public Feedback,” which has three maps of public input and equity considerations that played a significant role in determining potential site locations. The ”Disadvantaged & Tribal Communities” map displays federally identified Tribal Zones and DACs alongside identified AFCs. The ”Areas of Interest” map shows areas of interest identified by public feedback, where EV chargers would be valued. The final map in this section, ”Low-Income Roadway Users,” shows EV users traveling past a potential location site with a household income of $\$40,000$ or less. Potential site locations that were in DACs, areas of interest, or served low-income roadway users scored higher than sites that did not  

The third aspect of the StoryMap is ”Site Effectiveness,” which breaks down how potential sites were considered in terms of convenience and effectiveness. The first map, ”Adjacent Amenities,” shows nearby businesses within a 1-mile radius of a potential site, as this provides EV charging users with things to do while they wait for their vehicles to charge. The ”Connectivity Node” map indicates where hubs that connect multiple roadways within the AFC network are. Nodes are imperative because they highlight connectivity and efficiency. The final map in this section, ”Proximity to Electrical Substation,” was analyzed because substations regulate electricity as it moves through the power distribution network. Potential sites that were located nearby adjacent amenities, connection nodes, or electric substations scored higher than sites that were not.  

The final grouping of maps depicted travel patterns found throughout the state of Idaho that impacted site analysis and prioritization efforts. The first map, “Distance to DCFC\* Station,” demonstrates how far a potential site is from an existing potentially NEVI-compliant EV station. The second map, “Distance to non-DCFC\* Station,” opposingly, demonstrates how far a potential site is from a non-federally compliant EV station. Both maps have a maximum distance of 50 miles to correspond with the federal requirement that gaps between chargers must be less than 50 miles. Through noting where EV chargers exist, potential sites that fill gaps along AFCs scored higher than stations that would not fill gaps. The third map, ”Average Daily Traffic Volumes,” provides traffic data within a 1-mile radius of potential site locations to ensure highly used corridors scored higher than corridors with less traffic. The final map, ”Trip Length,” displays the distance traveled by vehicles past each potential site. Potential sites that served longer average distances scored higher compared to sites that served shorter trip length distances. The numeric values this map correspond to the percentage of drivers going past a location that are traveling greater than 50 miles with scale endpoints of $3\%$ and $99\%$ .  

Idaho Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Siting, Feasibility, and Access Study  

The results of all of the criteria for each potential site and their respective scores are ranked and displayed at the end of the StoryMap as an interactive dashboard. The dashboard displays overall rank, route specific rank, and route for each location analyzed. Each scored and ranked site can be clicked on to zoom to that location and shows a numerical score out of 10 for each criterion. The ”Data and Criteria” tab of the dashboard further breaks down each criterion’s weight and data source.  

# 3. Recommendations  

Through the prioritization process and combining the selected and analyzed criteria with public feedback and geographic considerations resulted in three tiers of site priority that are further aligned with the primacy of the AFC being considered. These tiers are roughly aligned with the Round 2 and Round 3 site solicitation strategies discussed in this section.  

# 3.1 Priority Site Locations  

Following federal guidelines to prioritize interstates, the Tier 1 sites are situated along interstates, specifically I-90, I-84, I-86, and I-15. The I-90 segment crossing the Idaho Panhandle has existing EV stations that are potentially NEVI-compliant, so no new stations are proposed. Along I-84, three new stations are recommended in Bliss, Jerome, and Fruitland. For the purposes of this analysis, it is noted that the Juniper Rest Stop fills a gap in the 50-mile siting requirement but as a state-owned rest stop it is not eligible as a NEVI-compliant stop in accordance with 23 CFR § 752.5, so it was removed as a recommended site. An exception will be requested for this segment of I-84. Along I-86, one new station is proposed in American Falls, and two stations along I-15 are proposed in Malad City and Dubois.  

Tier 2 recommendations include 29 stations on the highly traveled corridors of US-95, US-93, US-12, and SH-55. Currently, within Tier 2, there are no existing EV stations that meet federal requirements. Fourteen new stations are proposed along US-95 throughout Idaho. Similarly, eight new stations are recommended along US-93. Six sites are recommended along US-12, and three sites are located along SH-55. Tier 2 stations are based on up-to-date data; however, by the time Tier 1 is fully built-out, it is possible EV stations that meet federal requirements may exist along some of these AFCs.  

Tier 3 is the final piece of an interconnected EV network within Idaho along the AFCs including US-20, US-30, and SH-1. Tier 3 includes three recommended stations.  

Table 3-1 indicates the 38 recommended sites and which ones were a result of the data-driven analysis and which ones were necessitated by geography (shown in gray). Figure 3-1 also summarizes the recommendations on a map.

# 3.2 Solicitation Strategy  

According to guidance provided by the FHWA, NEVI plans should include an overall strategy for installations along designated AFCs that prioritizes build-out along the interstate highway system. Given funding constraints and the challenging geography and rural nature of Idaho, the IAWG intends to build out the AFCs by tiers. This approach requires three rounds of solicitation prioritizing the interstates and the US-95/SH-55 corridor and can be implemented over a 3-year or 4-year period.  

Round 1 – As established in the 2022 EV Infrastructure Baseline Plan (ITD 2022) and the 2023 Baseline Plan Update (IAWG 2023), the state will solicit and fund two to three sites (referred to as Pilot Sites in the plan). These Round 1 site locations were selected based on the preliminary findings of the SFAS and public input to service gaps on the I-84 corridor and US-95 as well as serving tribal communities. The Round 1 sites are located in or near the following locations (refer to Appendix D for further information):  

 Lewiston  Bliss Pocatello  

Round 2 – The second round of solicitation will be focused on building out the interstates to meet the 50-mile spacing requirement in the final rulemaking attached to the federal funding. This round of solicitation includes seven sites on three interstates (I-90 is already considered potentially NEVI-compliant) and includes:  

 I-84: Two new sites (Jerome and Fruitland) I-86: One new site (American Falls) I-15: Two new sites (Malad City and Dubois)  

Round 3 – The third round of solicitation will be focused on building out the US-95/SH-55 corridor given its importance as the vital north-south connection within the state, the population served, and the high number of vehicle trips. Build-out of this corridor will require 17 new sites including the following:  

 US-95: Twelve new sites  SH-55: Three new sites  

Subsequent phases focused on the remaining AFCs will be evaluated after the initial solicitation rounds depending on the remaining funding available. Prioritization will be given to US-93 and US-12 as follows:  

 US-93: Eight new sites  US-12: Four new sites  

The most rural AFCs, such as US-20, US-30, and SH-1, would be the lowest tier priority for EV charging installations. Achieving full build-out for this tier would require the following:  

 US-20: Two new sites   
 US-30: One new site SH-1: Does not require a new site because of the short length  

# Additional Siting Considerations  

Many feasibility and access considerations will be unique to each NEVI site and will require collaboration between the IAWG and the NEVI developer. Through the contracting process, the IAWG will outline minimum requirements and considerations for feasibility and access. During design and construction of the early sites, additional considerations may be realized and accounted for in Round 2 sites. This section outlines some considerations that currently apply broadly across the state as the NEVI sites are planned (more specific details are found in Appendix D).  

# 4.1 Economic Cost Modeling  

Idaho has been approved for Fiscal Years (FY)22, FY23, and FY24 funding based on the approval of the NEVI plans. The approved funding totals approximately $\$17.1$ million. Another anticipated $\$12.7$ million of funding would be approved in FY25 and FY26 with the approval of future plans.  

The federal funding cost share is $80\%$ , and private funds will likely be used to provide the remaining cost share. The state will have costs to administer the NEVI program including the following tasks:  

Planning   
 Solicitation administration Environmental documentation   
 Design reviews Construction administration and inspections Operations monitoring and data collection reporting  

The following project costs are eligible for federal NEVI funds:  

 The acquisition, installation, and network connection of EV charging stations, including data collection, access, and reliability   
 Proper operation and maintenance of EV charging stations   
 Long-term EV charging station data sharing  

Each site has unique characteristics that affect both capital and operating costs, making it difficult to estimate total project costs. Capital costs include right-of-way, electrical and site improvements, and charging infrastructure. Operating costs include electricity, network, and maintenance costs.  

Additionally, the revenue generation depends on the use rate and fee at each site. The revenue estimates then determine the balance of feasible up-front or operating costs to be borne by the developer or site operator.  

# 4.1.1 Assumptions Impacting Site Costs  

The assumptions described in this section will affect site costs.  

For right-of-way costs, site host agreements may vary, thus affecting the cost to acquire or use the property. Some NEVI developers may own the EV charging site, and some may need to pay the site owner for access to the site.  

For power costs, the cost required to deliver power to the site (grid side costs) may have a significant impact on the capital costs at each site. These costs vary depending on available power and site location.  

The costs include new or upgraded infrastructure, such as transformers or meters, trenching for new lines, and permitting and design coordination with the utility provider. In addition, the costs of zoning entitlements and required site improvements, such as additional paving, curbing, lighting, landscaping, and site amenities (that is, canopies or restrooms), can have a significant impact on site construction costs.  

The charging infrastructure costs include the actual equipment and ports that connect to the vehicles, and costs may depend on the ownership structure of each site. There may be a separate owner and operator, or they could be one, and these variables can affect the costs at each site.  

Operations and maintenance costs may depend on the utility rate structure, usage, and equipment. Negotiating the EV charging rate, or using established rates, will dictate the energy costs. Operations and maintenance costs may also include the operator, equipment, and facility maintenance; insurance; and software and network costs.  

Income generation depends on the utility rates, which can vary across operators and locations. Thus, the economic model for each site will vary greatly and will be determined by applicants based on their proposed site location and operating model.  

# 4.1.2 Example Cost Model  

Figure 4-1 shows a screenshot from an Argonne National Laboratory EV charging cost tool indicating the different variables affecting the economic model. The federal investment allows the capital costs of the private sector to be reduced by $80\%$ to encourage an overall positive economic model sooner in the life cycle of the project. The costs indicated here are estimated infrastructure costs and do not cover design and permitting. As stated above, final costs will be site dependent; however, this provides an overview of the factors considered in the cost modeling of the program.

Figure 4-1. Variables Affecting Economic Model of EV Charging Stations Source: ANL n.d.  

# 4.2 Ownership Models  

Different ownership model structures are being applied in different areas of the country as the NEVI program rolls out. The three most common ownership models implemented to date include the following:  

EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) Provider Ownership – The organization that owns or operates the equipment is the primary applicant for NEVI funds. The EVSE providers then contract separately with a site host for access to the property and may also subcontract with a separate entity for installation of the equipment. Additionally, the EVSE provider has an agreement with the utility provider to establish the rate of the electricity provided for use in EV charging. Site Host Ownership – Some business owners are interested in the business of EV charging and are the primary applicant for NEVI funds. These site hosts then contract separately with the EV supplier and/or the utility company. This is less common for small business owners as the intricacy of federal reporting requires more administrative effort, but this is more common for large commercial site hosts with multiple sites that have larger partnership agreements with EVSE suppliers. Utility Provider Ownership – Some energy providers have local authority and approval to operate their own EV charging. Utility providers that operate and maintain their own chargers may subcontract some installation or maintenance to third parties, but the operations are based on rate agreements that are often negotiated through their local public utility commission approvals.  

# 4.3 Seasonal Needs  

Idaho has a seasonal climate with high temperatures above 80 degrees Fahrenheit ${(^{\circ}\mathsf{F})}$ in the northern part of the state and above $90^{\circ}\mathsf{F}$ in the southern part of the state. Low temperatures average around $20^{\circ}\mathsf{F}$ . According to a 2019 research study from the American Automobile Association, Inc. (AAA 2019), when temperatures dip to $20^{\circ}\mathsf{F}$ and an EV’s heating system is used, the average driving range decreased by $41\%$ . Likewise, when temperatures reach $95^{\circ}\mathsf{F}$ and air conditioning is used, the driving range is reduced by $17\%$ . Eliminating the heating and air conditioning usage meant a less significant impact of temperature on driving range. Without the heat or air conditioning, the driving range was only reduced by $12\%$ for cold weather and $4\%$ for hot weather.  

Automobile manufacturers, such as Tesla, offer ways to improve battery efficiency, including warming up the battery and keeping it plugged in on cold days. The industry is continuing to advance battery technology to improve cold- and warm-weather efficiency.  

Evaluating potential sites will also analyze climate considerations for each site, such as weather exposure and ventilation or insulation. Some sites may benefit from shade or snow structures or weather-resistant materials to prevent moisture or excessive heat or cold that expand or contract cables and connectors. Site owners will need to provide snow and ice removal services to ensure safe access to equipment. Other sites may need to be oriented at a different angle to prevent sun glare or sun exposure.  

# 4.4 Evacuation Considerations and Resilience  

EV charging infrastructure will be a critical factor in maintaining mobility during emergency evacuation scenarios. There are several factors to ensure the charging network has redundancy and reliability through even the most complex events.  

Charging requires power, which can often be limited during emergency events. Factors such as battery backup or storage may help support EV charging during power outages.  

Communication and preparedness are critical factors during emergencies. Ensuring the right communication protocols are in place for emergency officials as well as the public will ensure that the demand for charging is prioritized to critical vehicles and dispersed where power is available.  

While the management of emergency situations falls under a variety of public and private leadership roles the NEVI program rollout will consider where key sites may support evacuation routes along Idaho AFCs.  

# 4.5 Payment Methods  

The NEVI guidelines require contactless payment that accepts major credit and debit cards and accept payment through either an automated toll-free phone number or a short message/messaging system. Payment methods must be accessible to persons with disabilities, not require a membership, not affect power flow to vehicles, and must provide access for those that have limited English proficiency.  

# 5. Areas of Further Study and Next Steps  

These recommendations are based on a data-driven priority and gap analysis, but additional study is necessary to determine a recommended approach toward build-out. After the initial solicitation of the Round 1 sites, any lessons learned will be analyzed and will inform an approach to Round 2 site solicitation phasing. There are several methods for letting construction projects that have advantages and disadvantages, and these will be evaluated to determine the most efficient and effective use of the Idaho NEVI Funds.  

# 5.1 Next Steps  

This SFAS serves as a planning foundation for the rollout of EV charging infrastructure. The next steps are to solicit the initial Round 1 sites identified in the NEVI plan at Lewiston, Bliss, and Pocatello and advance the construction on two of those sites. After that solicitation, the IAWG will identify and select solicitation phasing approaches for the subsequent phase of sites.  

Additionally, the IAWG will continue forward with outreach efforts, including public outreach and the Advisory Group. Finally, the IAWG anticipates two more rounds of NEVI plans due August 2024 and August 2025 that will help secure future funding years.  

# 5.2 Best Practices  

The NEVI Formula Program provides an opportunity for states to develop an EVSE network to promote the adoption of EVs, reduce range anxiety, and help reduce pollution and meet environmental goals. States are responsible for following federal and state regulations to build out their network using their formula funds. State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) are responsible for the administration of funds and overseeing the process of implementing the NEVI program from solicitation, design, construction, operations and maintenance, data collection, and reporting. The following sections outline best practices used by other states and how federal regulations are being accommodated through the process.  

# 5.2.1 Solicitation  

States are required to develop a transparent solicitation process and release Requests for Applications (RFAs) for site development. The RFA should be clear about the requirements and scoring of the applications. Before awarding a grant to the best-value applicant, federal requirements must be followed. States are issuing contingent awards until the following federal regulations are completed:  

The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires federal agencies (or state agencies that received federal dollars) to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions on the natural and human environment prior to making decisions. Using the NEPA process, agencies evaluate the environmental and related social and economic effects of their proposed actions. For the NEVI program, it is anticipated that the vast majority of sites will require a Categorical Exclusion (CatEx) because the sites have already been developed. Applicants are required to submit a schematic plan of the proposed construction area, so the state understands the scope and limits of work. Most state DOTs have been using consultants to perform an abbreviated title report for the properties and completion of the NEPA document. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 23, Section 1.23, Rights-of-way, requires states to acquire appropriate interest in the right-of-way and gain access to the site for the duration of the agreement according to 23 CFR 1.23(a). The property owner must provide the state with rights-of-way to allow the state to enter on to the property and inspect, maintain, observe, photograph, or conduct any study required for the state to comply with its requirements arising out of the federal regulations. Access can be granted through an access agreement or easement signed by the property owner.  

# 5.2.2 Design and Construction  

The selected NEVI developer will be required to follow federal and state requirements for design and construction. States have hired engineering consultants and construction inspection firms to review design plans and construction work. A key component of the design and construction efforts will be complying with the American Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). All work must comply with ADA and promote accessibility at EV charging stations. Developing an ADA checklist for design review and construction inspection will assist the NEVI developer in confirming ADA guidance is met. Information can be found at the U.S. Access Board website.  

For construction, the Davis-Bacon Act requires that all laborers and mechanics who are non-government employees receive prevailing wages. This requires that the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) wage rate report, DOL Certified Payroll Worksheet, and Request for Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate (SF1444) are to be submitted when a contractor or subcontractor’s work classification is not in the DOL wage determination, along with agreements that are affected by the Davis-Bacon Act requirement. State DOTs typically complete reports and perform interviews with laborers and mechanics to confirm prevailing wages are being received. This task could be performed by a third party if adequately trained and experienced in performing the work required by the Davis-Bacon Act.  

# 5.2.3 Data Collection and Reporting  

The NEVI developer will supply data following acceptance of the EVSE, as required by NEVI Formula Program Rules. Data must be transferred or available using methods agreed upon between the NEVI developer and the state along with federal EV-ChART data reporting requirements. The NEVI developer shall follow the following guidance for data reporting:  

 EV-ChART required and recommended data (Data Format and Preparation) Guidance  EV-ChART template  

To support the state’s performance monitoring and measurement, some states are requiring the NEVI developer to provide near real-time data.

# Contracting  

The IAWG is preparing the RFA document anticipated for the Round 1 solicitation. Evaluation criteria and scoring will be outlined in that RFA. The schedule for the RFA will also be shared with the public as the RFA becomes available.  

Following determination of the best-value applicant and any additional negotiations IAWG deems necessary, it is anticipated that the IAWG will contingently award agreements to the best-value applicants for at least two Round 1 sites.  

The award will be contingent upon two factors:  

1. An environmental review, conducted by IAWG at IAWG’s expense, in compliance with the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA). The anticipated duration for the NEPA review is 60 days. a. The best-value applicant will secure access to the site before IAWG’s environmental review such that IAWG has the right to enter the property and visually examine the property and grounds to complete environmental reviews necessary to comply with NEPA. b. If the department determines NEPA review will take longer than 60 days and would result in an undue cost to the department or an impact to the environment, IAWG reserves the right to reject the Round 1 site and select the next best Round 1 site for the pilot group.  

Execution of a site host agreement between the best-value applicant and the property owner (if the property owner is different than the best-value applicant) shall provide IAWG with a real property interest or other contractual right to access the Round 1 site for the term of the agreement. When the NEPA process is completed and the site host agreement(s) are in compliance with Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) policies and requirements, IAWG and the applicant will execute the agreement.  

# Design  

The selected NEVI developer will be required to prepare design documents, including construction drawings in accordance with the ITD. The NEVI developer will also comply with design and plan requirements set forth by other applicable governmental entities.  

The NEVI developer will submit the following elements in development of the design documents:  

 Biweekly design progress reports  $30\%$ design package  $90\%$ design package  Final design package Record drawings  

# $30\%$ Design  

The NEVI developer will prepare and submit the $30\%$ design package to the state. The $30\%$ design package will include the following:  

 Construction drawings developed sufficiently to convey layout of EVSE, EVSE-related equipment, proposed electric service, signage, lighting, parking/EVSE charging spaces (including ADA-compliant spaces)   
 Any relevant calculations associated with the construction drawings   
 A list of governing design and construction standards and requirements to be used in the design and construction of the site, including any request for modification to Applicable Standards (if any)   
 Electrical single line diagram   
 Environmental evaluation consisting of ITD Form 654 by the state   
 Traffic control plans, if applicable   
 Site plan: Ensure site plan includes medium voltage electrical utility service routing, size, type, and rating from utility medium voltage switch or connection.  Provide equipment layout.  

# $90\%$ Design  

The NEVI developer will prepare and submit a $90\%$ design package to the state for review that includes an update of all elements provided in the $30\%$ design package. The NEVI developer will include the following additional electrical details in the $90\%$ design package construction drawings:  

Electrical general notes   
 Electrical single line diagram   
 Equipment layout Site plan Equipment details/elevations ADA design details/elevations  

# Final Design  

The NEVI developer will submit a final design package to the state that includes the final construction drawings, final design calculations, list of governing design and construction standards and requirements, documentation of approved modifications to Applicable Standards (if any), and certification that the plans are compliant with the agreement.  

# Record Drawings  

The NEVI developer will prepare and submit record drawings to the state within 45 days following EVSE Acceptance. Record drawings will be submitted in electronic format (PDF, TIFF, and CADD) format.  

Record drawings will include all updates to the final design package, including any design changes, actual field as-built changes, actual survey information, and up-to-date copies of all other design documents including reports, calculations, and design files.  

Utility relocations performed by others, in conjunction with the project site (for example, telecom, gas, private electric, other private utilities), do not need to be incorporated into the CADD files and plan sheets. However, the utility relocation plans will be included as an attachment to the record drawings.  

The NEVI developer will provide record drawings and other related information to DIGLINE and 811 that allows location marking related to site improvements.  

# Operations  

The NEVI developer will be required to operate and maintain each site for a minimum of 5 years. A key requirement is to ensure the site is operational at least $97\%$ of the time. Another key factor is that the NEVI developer will be required to supply data for the duration of the operations, at a quarterly cadence. Further details for the operational requirements can be found in the federal rulemaking and negotiated on a site-by-site basis with the state.  

# Community and Disadvantaged Community Impact  

There are several items that NEVI developers will be asked to consider and integrate into plans. Items the state will review for equity include the following:  

 A site is located in a disadvantaged community.   
 A site is located in a rural community (rural being defined using the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau Urban-Rural Classification [i.e., rural areas encompass less than 2,000 housing units or less than 5,000 people]).   
 A site provides more than one ADA accessible parking space.  

# Considerations for Proposed NEVI Developers  

# Seasonal Needs  

The NEVI developer will prepare and submit a service plan, including standard operating procedures. The service plan will address operations and maintenance of facilities and electrical systems. The NEVI developer will clearly describe the procedures necessary for maintaining access and usage of equipment, including clearing of snow and debris.  

# Emergency Response  

The NEVI developer will prepare and submit a safety/emergency response plan (ERP). The ERP will be a site-specific approach to manage safety during the operating period. The NEVI developer will submit the ERP to the state before the proposed start date for EVSE testing.  

The following is the minimum information that will be in the ERP:  

 Identifying and communicating safety risks to those that will be involved in operations of EVSE  Identifying and documenting contacts for relevant emergency response parties and agencies  Resolving an incident in a timely manner, including identification of responsible parties Responding to electrical fires associated with EVSE and EVs  

# Payment Methods  

The final rule making details the payment options to be provided. The payment system will accept, at a minimum, contactless major debit and credit radio frequency identification (RFID) cards without incurring additional fees. Access codes and mobile applications are also encouraged for payment execution. At a minimum, the user will be able to make a payment using a credit card and one other option such as plug and charge or mobile payment via cell phone. The charging station will provide an automated toll-free phone number or a short message/messaging system that provides users with the option to initiate a charging session and submit payment. These payment options will also be clearly identified for users that have limited English proficiency or for users with disabilities.  

# Workforce Development  

Applicants will provide details on how to effectively include a workforce that participates in program certification such as minority-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and woman-owned businesses, during design, construction, and/or for purposes of operation and maintenance. The applicants will describe strategies to coordinate and integrate with State workforce development programs and describe EV labor and workforce considerations for the NEVI program in Idaho, including safety, training, and installation.  

The selected NEVI developer will submit a workforce training plan at least 10 business days before the proposed start date for EVSE testing. The workforce training plan will describe how the NEVI developer will support local training and/or workforce development that strives to enhance workforce competencies and strengthen job performance through developing innovative trainings and leveraging public-private partnerships.
