# ARTICLE I.  OVERVIEW  

# Section 1.01  Introduction  

N.J.S.A. 34:1B-374 to -382 (the “C-PACE Act”) established a C-PACE program in New Jersey. The Garden State Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (“C-PACE”) Program (“Garden State C- PACE Program” or the “Program”) provides a new form of financing for renewable energy, energy efficiency, water conservation, and certain types of resiliency-related improvements for New Jersey. The Program works by enabling eligible commercial, industrial, agricultural, and certain multi-family residential real property owners to access financing to undertake these kinds of improvements on their properties and repay the financing through the payment of an additional assessment to their municipality, similar to their real property tax, sewer, or water bill.  

The C-PACE Act directs the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (“Authority”) to develop guidelines for the Garden State C-PACE Program, (as may be amended or modified from time to time, “Program Guidelines”) to include the standard forms of documentation (“Uniform Assessment Documents”) to be used by Program participants, and to implement and oversee the Program. Accordingly, the Appendices are an integral part of the Program Guidelines. The official version of the Program Guidelines and all Appendices may be found on the Authority’s Program website.  Capitalized terms used in these Program Guidelines are found in Article XI unless otherwise defined herein.  

# Section 1.02  Authority Program Oversight  

The Authority has the responsibility for developing the Program Guidelines and determining whether proposed projects are eligible in accordance with the C-PACE Act and the Program Guidelines. The Authority does not provide any financing to borrowers under this Program, nor does the Authority approve any financing provided by lenders. As part of its role of ensuring compliance with the Program Guidelines, the Authority, in its sole discretion, may decide to contract with one or more third parties to assist the Authority. The Authority may also enter into a memorandum of agreement with one or more State of New Jersey (“State”) government agencies or instrumentalities to perform any actions the Authority may take with regard to the Program.  

# Section 1.03  Interpretation  

The C-PACE Act controls in the event of any inconsistency between the C-PACE Act and these Program Guidelines and any form of Uniform Assessment Document.  In the event of any inconsistency between these Program Guidelines and any Uniform Assessment Document, the Program Guidelines shall control.  Unless otherwise required by law, if the Program Guidelines are changed or updated by NJEDA after a C-PACE financing closes, the Program Guidelines in effect at the time the Assessment Agreement was signed shall control.

D. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the event that any lien on the Eligible Property shall be exposed to tax sale, pursuant to the “tax sale law,” N.J.S.A. 54:5-1 et seq., and is struck off and sold to the Participating Municipality, the C-PACE Assessment shall survive any subsequent action to foreclose the right of redemption and continue as a first lien upon the real estate described in the C-PACE Assessment, paramount to all prior or subsequent alienations and descents of the real estate or encumbrances, except subsequent taxes, charges, or other assessments, and provided that, notwithstanding the obligations of a Participating Municipality pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-53.1, while the Participating Municipality holds the lien or owns the Eligible Property, the Participating Municipality shall not be responsible for or required to make any payment from its treasury or any other source in furtherance of or to satisfy the CPACE Assessment. A Participating Municipality shall not bear any other responsibility in furtherance or satisfaction of a C-PACE Assessment, except that a Qualified Capital Provider may seek action to compel the Participating Municipality to enforce a lien through an action to foreclose.  

E. Eminent Domain or Condemnation. In the event of a taking of the Eligible Property by eminent domain or condemnation, the C-PACE Assessment may be accelerated or extinguished, at the election of the Qualified Capital Provider, provided the Qualified Capital Provider is compensated in accordance with the provisions of the “Eminent Domain Act of 1971,” N.J.S.A. 20:3-1 et seq., by the governmental entity utilizing eminent domain or condemnation for the balance due on the unpaid C-PACE Assessment and any interest, penalties, or other charges related thereto.  

# ARTICLE V.  TECHNICAL EVALUATION AND REVIEW  

# Section 5.01  Technical Evaluation  

The Garden State C-PACE Supplemental Guidelines set forth the technical evaluation and review requirements for projects that are not Retrofit Projects.  

“Technical Evaluation” means an evaluation of the proposed Eligible Improvements and the CPACE Project to ensure that they satisfy Program eligibility requirements. Technical Evaluations, for Retrofit Projects, must consist of, at a minimum, B or C below:

1. Certified Energy Manager or Certified Energy Auditor;   
2. Professional Engineer with demonstrated relevant experience; or   
3. Contractor with relevant demonstrated experience  

B. Whole Building Model Approach. This approach applies only to C-PACE Projects that include any Energy Efficiency Improvement. Using this approach, the technical evaluation will determine whether a proposed C-PACE Project meets or exceeds the applicable State energy subcode by calculating the delta between the energy performance of two models. One model representing meeting the State energy subcode and local building code and a second model representing the as-designed proposed C-PACE Project.   All relevant input and output data must accompany the model. If the applicable State energy subcode minimum is not met or exceeded, the proposed C-PACE Project is not eligible for Direct Financing funded with a CPACE Assessment.  

C. Prescriptive Approach. This approach requires an itemized list of each improvement that the Qualified Capital Provider proposes to fund. For a C-PACE Project that includes any Energy Efficiency Improvement, if the applicable State energy subcode minimum is not met or exceeded, the proposed C-PACE Project is not eligible for Direct Financing funded with a CPACE Assessment. The measures may be proven eligible through one or more of the following:  

1. U.S. Department of Energy COMcheck form;   
2. Equipment data sheet; or   
3. Other forms of documentation that detail the specifications of the Improvement(s).  

D. In addition to the documentation evidencing the approach described in B or C above, all Technical Evaluations for C-PACE Projects must include, at a minimum:  

1. The scope of work for the proposed C-PACE Project;   
1. Documentation demonstrating that the proposed C-PACE Project meets the definition of a C-PACE Project, and the proposed improvements meet the definition of an Eligible Improvement;   
2. Direct Costs and Indirect Costs of the proposed C-PACE Project, as described in Section 2.04;   
3. Identification of the Effective Useful Life (EUL) of each Eligible Improvement;   
4. The appropriate evaluation(s) as determined in the table below. If multiple Eligible Improvements are associated with a single C-PACE Project, the respective Technical Evaluation (ASHRAE Level 1, ASHRAE Level 2, Feasibility Study, etc.) must be completed;   
5. For Water Conservation Measures, projected water savings in in kilogallons;   
6. For Energy Efficiency Improvements, projected kilowatt-hours (electricity) or therms (natural gas); and   
7. For Renewable Energy Improvements, projected generation in kilowatt-hours.

# Section 5.04  Useful Life Calculation  

Weighted Average Useful Life (WAUL)  

The WAUL of a C-PACE Project is calculated on a weighted average basis from the WAUL of each Eligible Improvement that are of the same type with the same estimated useful life (EUL) using the following process:  

The WAUL is calculated by:  

1. For Eligible Improvements that are of the same type with the same EUL (Similar Eligible Improvements), calculate the ratio (percentage) of the costs of such Similar Eligible Improvements to the total cost of all the Eligible Improvements.   
2. Multiply that percentage by the EUL of those Similar Eligible Improvements.   
3. Sum the result of all the calculations under #2 for each group of Similar Eligible Improvements. The resulting sum is the WAUL.  

Below is an example for a C-PACE Project that consists of the following Eligible Improvements:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Cost</td><td>% Of Total</td><td>EUL (years)</td><td>EUL (years)</td></tr><tr><td>Insulation</td><td>50,000</td><td>19%</td><td>20</td><td>3.70</td></tr><tr><td>Windows</td><td>20,000</td><td>7%</td><td>30</td><td>2.22</td></tr><tr><td>HVAC</td><td>200,000</td><td>74%</td><td>20</td><td>14.81</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>270,000</td><td>100%</td><td>WAUL=</td><td>20.74</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Step 1  

Insulation: $\frac{\$50,000}{\$270,000}=19\%$  

$$
{\mathsf{H V A C}}\colon{\frac{\S200,000}{\S270,000}}=74\%
$$  

Step 2  

Insulation: $19\%\times20\mathsf{y e a r s}=3.70$ years Windows: 7% x 30 years $=2.22$ years HVAC: $74\%\times20\mathsf{y e a r s}=14.81$ years  

Step 3  

$3.70+2.22+14.81=20.74$ years WAUL

# ARTICLE VII. LOCAL C-PACE PROGRAM  

A municipality which, as of the Launch Date of the Program, is in the top third of municipalities in the State in terms of population (rounded up), according to the most recent American Community Survey published by the United States Census Bureau (“Authorized Municipality”), may establish a Local C-PACE Program subject to approval by the Authority. A county may also establish a Local C-PACE Program pursuant to a local C-PACE program ordinance to facilitate the financing of C-PACE projects in Participating Municipalities located in that county. The Authority shall publish a list of Authorized Municipalities and counties with approved Local C-PACE Programs on the Authority’s Program website. Qualified Capital Providers may not originate or finance CPACE Projects in municipalities or counties in which they are contracted by the municipalities or counties to administer the Local C-PACE program.  

# Section 7.01  Establishing a Local C-PACE Program  

The process for establishing a Local C-PACE Program is as follows:  

A. For an Authorized Municipality that is not a Participating Municipality, the Authorized Municipality shall follow the process to be designated a Participating Municipality as set forth in Section 3.01.   
B. Submission of an application to establish a Local C-PACE Program to the Authority which application shall include, but not be limited, to: 1. Proposed Local C-PACE Program ordinance that authorizes the creation of the Local CPACE Program, with an opinion of counsel that the Local C-PACE Program ordinance is consistent with the requirements in N.J.S.A. 34:1B-378(b) and -379; 2. An acknowledgement that the Authorized Municipality or, in the case of a Local C-PACE Program established by a county, any Participating Municipality located in that county, shall use the Uniform Assessment Documents prepared by the Authority, as they may be amended from time to time; and 3. Draft Local C-PACE Program Guidelines, exclusive of the uniform assessment document, with an opinion of counsel that the Local C-PACE Program Guidelines are consistent with these Program Guidelines.   
C. After receipt of a completed application, the Authority will review the application to confirm that it is in compliance with these Program Guidelines and the C-PACE Act and either approve or decline the application within 60 days after its receipt. If the Authority does not act within 60 days after receipt, the application shall be deemed approved.   
D. Upon the Authority’s approval of the application, the Authorized Municipality or county, may adopt the draft Local C-PACE Program Ordinance and issue the draft Local C-PACE Program Guidelines. Neither Authorized Municipalities nor counties are authorized to approve C-PACE Projects without the Authority’s approval of its Local C-PACE Program.  

E. If the Authority declines the application, it shall provide a detailed explanation to the Authorized Municipality or county as to the reasons for the declination and the changes necessary to bring the draft Local C-PACE Program Ordinance and Local C-PACE Program into compliance with the requirements of the C-PACE Act. The Authorized Municipality or county may submit a revised application addressing the reasons and making the change indicated by the Authority. The Authorized Municipality or county shall not adopt the proposed Local C- PACE Program Ordinance if the Authority declines its application.  

# Section 7.02  Role and Use of Local C-PACE Programs  

Any county that establishes a Local C-PACE Program shall do so only for the benefit of Participating Municipalities located within that county, but the Participating Municipalities shall remain responsible for the process of levying, billing, collecting, remitting, and enforcing the CPACE Assessment. In a county or Authorized Municipality that has established a Local C-PACE Program, any C-PACE Projects in that Authorized Municipality or, in the case of a county, in any Participating Municipality located in that county, may be financed pursuant to the Garden State CPACE Program or the Local C-PACE Program. In a Participating Municipality that has not established or is located in a county that has not established, a Local C-PACE Program, any CPACE Projects in that Participating Municipality may be financed pursuant to the Garden State CPACE Program only.
