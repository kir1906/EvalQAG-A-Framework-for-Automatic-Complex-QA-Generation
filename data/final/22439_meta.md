 ## Summary : 
 Illinois uses a specific formula to value commercial solar energy systems for
property tax purposes in counties with fewer than 3 million inhabitants.
"Commercial" in this sense means that the system is used primarily to generate
electricity for wholesale or retail sale, rather than referring to the
customer class.

The valuation formula is calculated by substracting allowance for physical
depreciation from the trended real property cost basis (set at $218,000 per MW
of nameplate capacity in 2018, with adjustments for CPI inflation). More
