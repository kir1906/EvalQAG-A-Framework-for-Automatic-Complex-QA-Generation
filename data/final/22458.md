# WHATIS COMMUNITY-BASED RENEWABLE ENERGY?  

In 2015, Act 100 of the Hawaii State Legislature directed the Hawai Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to establish a "communitybased renewable energy" tariff (Section 269-27.4, Hawaii Revised Statutes). The details of the tariffs and programs have been (and are being) developed under PUC Docket No. 2015-0389.  

.tariff is a published volume of rate schedules and general terms and conditions under which a product or service will be supplied.  

The stated intent of the program is "to make the benefits of renewable energy generation more accessible to a greater number" of Hawaii residents and businesses who would otherwise be unable to directly participate in renewable energy generation for reasons such as lack of up-front capital for their own renewable energy system; building or home location, which may not receive enough sunlight or may be located on a saturated circuit; building type or roof design that may not be able to physically support the solar panels; proximity or other limited access to the utility grid; and/or property ownership status (e.g., renters, lessees).  

Community-based renewable energy (CBRE) is also commonly referred to as "community solar" and is referred to by Hawaian Electri as "Shared Solar." In a CBRE program:  

A Subscriber Organization is a company, organization, or group of people who owns, develops, or operates a CBRE project in an electric utility's service territory.  

A Subscriber is a customer (in the service territory of the same electric utility) who agrees to pay a Subscriber Organization for a portion of the output from the Subscriber Organization's renewable energy project. These credits are applied to the Subscriber's electric utility account to offset a portion of the Subscriber's electricity bill.  

: is important to note that Subscribers purchase the renewable energy credits from a Subscriber Organization and the electric utility pplies those credits to the Subscriber's electric bill.

# CURRENT STATUS OF HAWAII'S CBRE PROGRAM  

# Phase  

Phase 1 CBRE Projects selected.   
Projects are both operational and under development (Hawaiian Electric territory only). See our Project Directory for more information on these projects.  

# Phase 2  

ranche 1: Request for Proposals (RFP) for Tranche 1 on O'ahu, Maui, and Hawai sland is undergoing project selection. Additiona hformation is available on Hawaian Electric's Tranche 1.  

Low- and Moderate- Income: November 2022 - Hawaiian Electric selected seven solar projects on O'ahu, Hawai'i Island, and Maui fo Low- and Moderate- (LMl) Income subscribers. Once the projects are available for subscription, LMl customers may become subscribers to a facility on their island. When built, the customers can receive credits on their electricity bills. See the Hawaian Electri News Release for more information.  

# RFP for Molokai and Lanai Subscribers  

BRE Lanai RFP documents are available on Hawaian Electric's CBRE Lanai RFP Documents Webpage.  

BRE Molokai documents are available on Hawaiian Electric's CBRE Molokai RFP Documents Webpage.  

# AFTER THE RFP IS APPROVED - CBRE PHASE 2  

. Subscriber Organizations will bid on the RFP or fillout an application depending on the CBRE project size. Project sizes are ;ummarized in the table below, based on the current RFP.  

'LMI" means "low- and moderate-income"; "PPA" means "power purchase agreement."  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Large projects</td><td>Mid-Tier projects</td><td>Small projects</td></tr><tr><td>O'ahu</td><td>>5MW (LMI and Tranche 1)</td><td>250kW-5MW (LMI and Tranche 1)</td><td><250kW</td></tr><tr><td>Maui,Lanai,andHawai'ilsland</td><td>>2.5MW (LMI Applicants Only)</td><td>250kW-2.5MW (LMI and Tranche 1)</td><td><250kW</td></tr><tr><td>Molokai</td><td>N/A</td><td>250kW-2.5MW</td><td><250kW</td></tr></table></body></html>  

n November 2022, Hawaian Electric selected seven projects for development with subscriptions reserved for LMI customers.  

Small projects require an application submitted to Hawaian Electric.   
·Mid-Tier projects require procurement through a formal RFP competitive bid process.   
Large projects require a separate PPA approval from the PUC.  

2. The electric utility will contract with Subscriber Organizations for the electrical output from the project(s).  

3. Each project will undergo planning, permitting, construction, and interconnection to the electric utility.  

4. Subscriber Organizations will announce and advertise share for lease or purchase to potential Subscribers.  

# WHEN THE CBRE PROJECT IS AVAILABLE FOR CUSTOMER SUBSCRIPTION  

5. Subscribers will select from the eligible CBRE projects in their service territory.  

· Subscribers will enter a "Subscriber Agreement" with the Subscriber Organizations for an interest in the CBRE project(s) the) choose.  

6. Each Subscriber Organization will sell the monthly kWh generated by the CBRE project to the electric utility.  

7. The Electric Utility will convert the purchased kwh to a dollar amount.  

8. The Subscriber will receive a credit from the utility based on their share of the CBRE project and the amount will be deducted fron the Subscriber's monthly utility bill.  

· The bill credit is based on a preset credit rate, the amount of electricity generated, and the size of the customer's subscription with the Subscriber Organization.  

# HOW TO BECOME ASUBSCRIBER ORGANIZATION  

A Subscriber Organization can be any organization such as a neighborhood, club, homeowners association, church, labor union, charitable organization, environmental organization, or a company that develops renewable energy facilities. The utility can act as a Subscriber Organization under certain circumstances.  

Potential Subscriber Organizations for Hawaiian Electric's service area should register at: https://communityenergyHawaii.com/#/SORegistration.
