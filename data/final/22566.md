# Solar incentives  

With the cost of a solar installation half of what it was a decade ago, and solar panels producing more power per square foot and dollar invested, solar is even more accessible. We offer cash incentives to assist with adding solar or solar plus battery storage (for power backup) to your new construction or major renovation project.
