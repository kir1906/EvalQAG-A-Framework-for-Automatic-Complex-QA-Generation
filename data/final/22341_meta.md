 ## Summary : 
 Stowe Electric is offering a rebate for Level 2 charging stations that are
installed at a workplace, public building or parking lot, or commercial
location and available for customers, visitors, and public users.  
  
Level 2 stations are eligible for a $250 rebate per charger if they are
available to public users, employees, or visitors, but are not networked to
any operations and maintenance agreement or fee-based pay portal.  
  
Level 2 stations are eligible for a $500 rebate per charger (maximum of $2,000
per year per customer) if the stations are available to public users and
connected to a network with an operation and maintenance portal and/or fee-
based portal. These stations can limit public charging to a defined time-
period during normal business hours and after-hours.
