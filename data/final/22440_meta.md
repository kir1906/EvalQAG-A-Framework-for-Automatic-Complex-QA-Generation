 ## Summary : 
 **_Note: Information on community renewable projects in Illinois is also
listed in the[Net Metering program
entry](https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/2700/net-
metering)._**

Illinois's most recent rules for community renewable generation projects are
derived from Public Act 102-0662 (titled the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act)
of 2021.

Community solar projects are owned and operated by third parties, which offer
subscriptions to individuals and businesses. Bill credits are provided by the
electric utility at a rate which includes energy supply, transmission, and
capacity values but excludes delivery service costs.

Incentives for community solar projects are provided through the [Illinois
Shines](https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/22441/adjustable-
block-program-illinois-shines) and [Illinois Solar for
All](https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/22442/illinois-solar-
for-all-program) programs, which purchase RECs from project developers.
