# On-Going Reporting Requirements UD-19-01: Establishing A Docket And Opening A Rulemaking Proceeding To Establish Renewable PortfolioStandards  

Council Docket UD-19-01, established via Resolution R-19-109, is a rulemaking proceeding to establish a renewable portfolio standard ("RPS") for the City of New Orleans. The RPS requires Entergy New Orleans $(^{\prime\prime}\mathsf{E N O}^{\prime\prime})$ to use a certain amount of energy from renewable sources (e.g. solar, wind, biomass) in its resource portfolio. This proceeding is consistent with the Council's expressed support for the efficient use of clean, sustainable technology to improve the quality of life for citizens and businesses.  

The Council solicited feedback on the following key questions:  

(1) What would an appropriate RPS target for New Orleans be, and should it be a requirement or a goal?  

(2) How should a New Orleans' RPS target be satisfied?  

(3) How should the RPS standard be enforced, should the Council consider a penalty or Alternative Compliance Payment structure?  

(4) What protections should be put in place to protect ratepayers from unreasonable increases in rates due to RPS?
