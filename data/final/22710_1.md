# Combine IRA Savings with State Incentives to Upgrade Your Home With Efficiency and Comfort in Mind  

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) helps New Yorkers get the latest clean energy technologies and equipment that will save energy for years to come. From the cars we drive, to the ways we heat and cool our homes, the IRA is helping New Yorkers choose clean energy technologies that improve their health, safety, and quality of life.  

Did you know?  

It typically costs less to heat your home with a heat pump than it does to use oil, propane, or other types of electric heat.  

# New York State is investing in charging stations for towns and businesses to help EV drivers get from point A to point B.  

Since 2023, IRA tax credits have been available to New Yorkers. As of June 2024, income-eligible New Yorkers can access IRA rebates to get upfront discounts on home energy upgrades. Both IRA tax credits and rebates can help homeowners cut energy use, save more money, and contribute to a cleaner, healthier planet. Now is the time to start your clean energy future.  

# Inflation Reduction Act Rebates  

New York State is in the process of rolling out IRA rebates, with initial funding available for income-eligible New Yorkers through the EmPower+ program and the Appliance Upgrade Program. Additional IRA rebates, including offers for multifamily buildings and certain high-efficiency appliances, will become available in 2025.  

Income-eligible New Yorkers can access rebates on energy-efficient heat pump clothes dryers, plus any necessary electrical upgrades to install the equipment, through the Appliance Upgrade Program.  

Eligible ENERGY STAR® certified heat pump dryer models [PDF] must be purchased through participating retailers [PDF]. Electrical upgrades may include both electric panel and wiring upgrades, which need to be performed by a participating contractor to receive rebates.  

Income-eligible homeowners and landlords of one-to-four family homes can use EmPower+ funding to lower the upfront cost of energy efficiency improvements and all-electric equipment in their homes. Possible EmPower+ incentives are based on household income and include maximum limits for the type of energy efficiency improvement.  

Low-income, single-family households are eligible for no-cost energy efficiency improvements capped at $\$10,000$ per project.   
Moderate-income single-family households are eligible for no-cost energy efficiency improvements capped at $\$5,000$ per project.  

Empower+ funding can cover a range of upgrades, with prioritization for core energy efficiency improvements, including insulation, air sealing, health and safety items, and replacement of inefficient refrigerator/freezer units. For homes that have air sealing and insulation completed, contractors can make recommendations to upgrade heating and cooling equipment through EmPower+.  

Home Electrification Appliance Rebate (HEAR) funding through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) recently expanded the incentives that income-eligible New Yorkers can receive through EmPower+ program to make their homes more comfortable and energy efficient. This funding is in addition to the incentive amounts listed above.  

Air sealing, insulation, and ventilation: $\$1,600$ Electrical wiring upgrade: $\$2,500$ Electrical service upgrade (panel box): $\$4,000$ Heat pump water heaters: $\$1,750$ Heat pumps: $\$8,000$  

Incentives for two- to four-family households are based on income eligibility and the number of units in the buildings.  

EmPower+ customers receive a no-cost home energy assessment that pinpoints where a home is wasting energy, flag any safety or health issues, and identify energy-saving improvements. To fill any home energy upgrade funding gaps, customers can apply for low-interest financing through NYSERDA’s Residential Financing programs and explore qualifying IRA tax credits below.  

# Inflation Reduction Act Tax Credits  

The table below shows the IRA tax credits and NYS incentives you may be eligible to receive when you purchase a qualifying item. Eligibility for IRA and NYS offerings varies by product and may be based on household income, federal income tax liability, product specifications, and more.  

Consult the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance for taxpayers on credits and deductions  and your tax advisor to determine IRA eligibility. Income-eligible New Yorkers may be able to receive additional State and federal rebates along with the incentives and rebates listed below.

# New York State Helps You Get the Most Out of the IRA  

For years, New York’s nation-leading climate actions  have included programs to help New Yorkers switch to clean energy options. The IRA does not replace those New York State clean energy programs — it enhances  

them. New Yorkers can still take advantage of existing State programs to help them save more money, more energy, and get the most out of their IRA incentives.  

All New York residents are eligible to receive a no-cost home energy assessment that can reveal how efficiently your home is operating and where energy is being wasted. An assessment will provide you with recommendations to save energy and improve the efficiency, comfort, and safety of your home.

# How to Claim IRA Tax Credits and Save  

The IRA will help most Americans reduce the purchase cost of clean energy technologies through tax credits.  

# Here’s how it works:  

When you purchase a qualifying clean energy technology , save your proof of purchase to be included with your yearly tax return.   
When you submit your tax return for the year you installed the qualifying technology, work with your tax preparer to indicate that you made a qualifying clean energy improvement to your home and the amount it cost.   
Qualifying credits will be applied to your federal tax return, meaning you will either receive a larger refund or owe a smaller amount, depending on your circumstances. Read the IRS’s FAQs about energy efficient home improvements and residential clean energy property credits  or consult with a tax professional to better understand your particular tax situation.
