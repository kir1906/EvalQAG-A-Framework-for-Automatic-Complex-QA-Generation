# EV Home Charger Rebate  

Are you looking to add a home charger for your electric vehicle? Alabama Power customers can receive a one-time $\$500$ rebate for the purchase and installation of a Level 2 (240V) charger at their home with our Home Charger Rebate.  

EV home charging provides an affordable and convenient way to charge, allowing your vehicle to charge while you sleep. Adding a Level 2 charger allows you to charge up to 10 times faster1 than a Level 1 (120v) charger. With the help of our Home Charging Rebate, you’re in charge.
