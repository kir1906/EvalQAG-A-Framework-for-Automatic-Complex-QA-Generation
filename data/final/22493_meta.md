The New Hampshire Department of Energy (DOE) offers grant funding for low-
moderate-income community solar projects in manufactured housing communities
or multifamily rental housing. The grant program is allocated at least 15% of
the annual [renewable energy fund](https://www.energy.nh.gov/renewable-
energy/renewable-energy-fund-grants) (per [S.B.
129](https://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?id=957&txtFormat=html&sy=2017)).

Eligible projects are those defined as "ground-mounted or rooftop solar arrays
that directly benefit a group of at least [five] residential end-user
customers," and have at least a majority of residential customers "at or below
300 percent federal poverty guidelines," according to [RSA
362-F:10](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/NHTOC/NHTOC-
XXXIV-362-F.htm).

_*In 2021, the New Hampshire DOE was given the administration and
implementation authority over RPS policy and the renewable energy fund
(per[H.B.
