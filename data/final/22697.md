# Energy efficiency programs / Demand Conservation  

This program pays our residential and small business customers who allow us to cycle off enrolled air conditioners, water heaters, and pool pumps during high-energy demand periods.  

This program is not accepting new enrollments currently; however, we do encourage other interested customers to check ou our Bring Your Own Thermostat (BYOT) program.  

The BYOT program is similar to the Demand Conservation program where participating customers help LG&E and KU during high energy demand days and it pays customers after each successful participation of an event. The BYOT program is a Wi-fi connection to your smart thermostat which allows us to adjust the temperature by a few degrees before and during the event period.
