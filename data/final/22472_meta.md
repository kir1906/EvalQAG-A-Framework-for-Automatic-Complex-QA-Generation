 ## Summary : 
 New Mexico provides a 10% personal income tax credit (up to $6,000) for
taxpayers that own a residence, business, or agricultural enterprise who
purchase and install certified photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal systems on
their property. Eligible systems include grid-tied commercial and industrial
PV systems, off-grid and grid-tied residential PV systems, active solar
thermal systems, and systems with or without storage. To be eligible, systems
must first be certified by the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural
Resources Department. The taxpayer must then apply for the tax credit with the
New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department within 12 months of installation.
Note that solar pool or hot tub heaters and passive solar heating are not
eligible for this tax credit.  
  
If the credit exceeds a taxpayer's tax obligation, the taxpayer will receive
the excess as a tax refund that year. Aggregate credit levels are capped
annually at $12,000,000. These tax credits are set to expire December 31,
2032.  
  
All relevant forms and eligibility requirements are available on the program
website listed above.
