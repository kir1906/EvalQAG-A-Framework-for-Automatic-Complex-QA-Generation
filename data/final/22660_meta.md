 ## Summary : 
 **_Note:[The Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf#page=993)
created the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/) with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

In its original [NEVI
plan](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/ev_deployment_plans/sd_nevi_plan.pdf),
the South Dakota Department of Transportation (SDDOT) expects a minimum of 13
additional NEVI-Compliant charging locations will be needed to meet the
program requirements of a 50 mile maximum distance between charging locations.
The Department expects this phase to begin no sooner than 2024. SDDOT will
create an application process for third parties to provide the matching funds
to design, install, and maintain the needed charging infrastructure on South
Dakota's AFCs. In FY 2026, SDDOT expects to complete its AFC-ready
requirements and begin deployments in non-AFC locations (e.g. US and State
highways). In August 2023, the state submitted its [2023 plan
update](https://dot.sd.gov/media/documents/SD%20DOT%20EV%20Implementation%20Plan%202023%20clean%208%201%202023_508%20Review.pdf)
which provided a status of the state's NEVI plan, but no plan changes from
previous years.
