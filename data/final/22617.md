Jurisdiction  

TheState of North Carolina works with federal agency partners to responsibly identify offshore wind opportunities for North Carolina's outer continental shelf. The U.s. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management(https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy)(BOEM)hasjurisdiction beginning three nauticalmilesfromshoreandseaward.  

Coastal wind energy-related activities occurring within three nautical miles of shore are subject to North Carolina'sjurisdiction. A number of federal activities must undergo Federal Consistency Review (https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/coastal-management/coastal-management-permits/federalconsistency)bytheDivision of Coastal Management(DCM).

Two additional proposed Wind Energy Areas (WEAs) are located off the North Carolina Coast, known asWilmingtonEast WEAand WilmingtonWestWEA.  

On July 21, 2021, BOEM convened a meeting of the Carolina Long Bay Task Force (https:/www.boem.gov/regional-carolina-long-bay-intergovernmental-renewable-energy) to discuss the past and present of Carolina Long Bay offshore wind development and the approach forpossibleleasesalewithfederal,tribal,state,and localgovernmentofficials  

BOEM and the cooperating agencies are evaluating new information including new studies, newly listed species,and the designation of theNorthAtlantic Right Whale Critical Habitat to determine the adequacy of the previous EA and whether BOEM may need to supplement with additional analyses.  

OnJuly7,2021,NCDEQhosted aninformational meetingforinterested stakeholders about the BOEM offshore wind leasing process and the role of the BOEM Renewable Energy Task Force in this work. The slide deck and recording of the informational meeting are available here:

# Consistency Determination  

(https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/coastal-management)  

This authority exists under the federal Coastal Zone Management Act (https://coast.noaa.gov/czm/act/).The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) was enacted by the federal government on Oct. 27, 1972, to encourage coastal states, such as North Carolina,to develop comprehensive programs to manage and balance competing uses of and impacts to coastal resources. Consistency review by DcM applies to any federal action that is within the state's twenty coastal counties (http://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/coastal-management/aboutcoastal-management/cama-counties)that may have a reasonableforeseeable effect on any coastal resource or any coastal use within the state's coastal zone(even if the activity occurs outside of the coastal zone),if the activity:  

· is a federal activity;   
·requires a federal license or permit;   
·receivesfederal money; or   
· is a plan for exploration, development or production from any area leased under the Quter Continental Shelf Lands Act. (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011- title43/pdf/USCODE-2011-title43-chap29-subchaplll.pdf)  

Such projects must comply with the key elements of North Carolina's Coastal Management Program,which include:  

·“Review of offshore fossil fuel facilities" in the Coastal Area Management Act (https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/coastal-management/coastal-management-rules/cama) Rules  

§ 113A-119.2. (a) and (b) and related subsections ·The state's Dredge and Fill Law (https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/coastalmanagement/coastal-management-rules/nc-dredge-fill-law) ·Chapter7 of Title 15A of N.C.'s Administrative Code (https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/coastal-management/coastal-managementrules/coastal-development-rules), specifically the following sections in Subchapter 7H “State GuidelinesforAreasofEnvironmental Concern(/coastal-management/rule-changes/15a

The purpose of a consistency determination is to assure that federal projects, federal funded projects, and private projects that require federal approval are consistent with the relevant enforceablepoliciesof the state's certified coastal management program.
