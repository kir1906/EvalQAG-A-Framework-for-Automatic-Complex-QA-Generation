 ## Summary : 
 In January 2018, the Governor of New Jersey established a goal of 3,500
megawatts (MW) of offshore wind energy development by 2030 with the signing of
[Executive Order 8](https://www.nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-8.pdf). In
November 2019, [Executive Order
92](https://www.nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-92.pdf) increased the goal
to 7,500 MW by 2035. The goal was again increased by [Executive Order
307](https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-307.pdf), and currently
requires 11,000 MW of offshore wind by 2040.
