Energy Innova​tion rebates are available only for qualifying purchases and/or services. The availability of the Energy Innovation Rebate Program is limited, and rebates will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis. To be eligible for the re​bate program, all rebate forms and accompanying documentation must be submitted within 60 days of the completion of construction and/or installation. Rebates are capped at $\$1,200$ per home. Receipts for every rebate must be submitted with an application. United reserves the right to make on-site inspections of any equipment submitted for a rebate. Payment is made to the person who filed for program participation. Any other payment arrangements must be submitted in writing by the homeowner or developer.  

All water heater and heat pump efficiency ratings are based on true ratings shown in the Air Conditioning, Heat​ing and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) directory. A licensed dealer or contractor must install the heating/cooling systems. To qualify for United’s HVAC equipment rebate, both heat pump components—indoor (coil) unit and outdoor (con​denser) unit—must be properly matched and determined by the AHRI guide. Rebates will not be considered when only one component is replaced.
