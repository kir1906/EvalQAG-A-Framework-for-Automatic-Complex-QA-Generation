 ## Summary : 
 The Arkansas Department of Transportation (DOT)
[plans](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/ev_deployment_plans/ar_nevi_plan.pdf)
to use NEVI funding to set up a competitive procurement process for EVSE (EV
supply equipment) site hosts, owners, and operators throughout the state.
Funding will be used to build out charging infrastructure along the state's
interstates and routes of significance, coordinating with neighboring states
when necessary. NEVI funding will help construct about 512 miles of EV
charging corridors. The procurement will be conducted through a competitive
grant program, and an [updated plan](https://www.ardot.gov/wp-
content/uploads/ARDOT_EVID_2023_Plan_Final.pdf) was released in August 2023,
stipulating that an RFP would be released in the summer/fall of 2023, with
first round awards to be announced in late 2023/early 2024 per the updated
plan schedule.

As of June 2024, the ARDOT is still developing its program.
