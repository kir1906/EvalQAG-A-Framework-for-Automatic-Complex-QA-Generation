# Confirm Income Qualification  

The rebates you can get depends on your household income and your project. You can qualify for rebates through HOMES (Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings) and HEAR (Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates) based on how much energy you’re expected to save and your household income. The more energy you save, the higher the rebates. We can help you check if you qualify based on your income.  

# Get Your Free Home Assessment  

Getting a free home energy assessment is one of the first steps in the Energy Saver North Carolina program. The energy assessor will help you understand how your home uses energy and give you a list of qualified improvements to help you save the most energy.  

By updating equipment, insulating, air sealing, and finding other ways to save energy, you’ll unlock rebates, instant discounts, and other incentives to save money, energy, and make your home more comfortable.  

Qualifying project upgrades might include:  

· ENERGY STAR? certified heating, cooling, and water heating equipment.   
ENERGY STAR certified appliances, doors, windows, and ventilation fans.   
Insulation and air sealing installation.
