 ## Summary : 
 The City of Charlotte's [Sustainable Facilities
Policy](https://www.charlottenc.gov/files/sharedassets/city/v/1/city-
government/departments/documents/revised_sustainable_facilities_policy_2021.pdf)
requires that all new City-owned and City-managed construction and major
renovation projects achieve LEED/Global Greens certification and, where
applicable, achieve Designed to Earn ENERGY STAR Certification. Additionally,
all City-owned and City-managed buildings greater than 5,000 sq. ft. are
required to benchmark their energy use intensity. The Sustainable Facilities
Policy also prohibits the usage of various personal-type appliances in spaces
designated as "common areas."

In April 2024, the Charlotte City council adopted the following changes to the
Sustainable Facilities Policy:

**New Constructions**

  * Requires all new facilities to be all-electric except for back-up generation
  * Utilize geothermal systems for HVAC
  * Requires building automation systems
  * Requires smart surfaces to reduce energy and heat (cool pavement and roofs)  

  * Requires feasibility analysis to determine if building a net-zero building is possible

  

**New Construction & Major Renovations  
**

  * Encourages the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) environmental life cycle assessment
  * Strengthens and expands on-site solar renewable energy
  * Scopes energy storage systems (e.g., battery) to maximize solar energy
  * For facilities that meet the bicycle network requirement, new construction will pursue LEED Bicycle facility credit, which supports mode-shift and includes bicycle storage
  * Requires a periodic analysis for HVAC replacement projects to determine if electrification of systems can occur
