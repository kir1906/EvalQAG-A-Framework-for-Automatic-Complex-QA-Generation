# North Dakota Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure Program  

North Dakota created the federally required Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Infrastructure Program to obtain National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program funding from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill (BIL). The Federal NEVI Program is intended to create a network of EV fast chargers across the country that provides reliable and consistent infrastructure to support long distance travel.  

North Dakota has received approximately $\$25.9$ million from the NEVI Formula Program through FY 2026 to build chargers no more than 50 miles apart and within one mile off exits along I-94 and I-29.  

Additionally, North Dakota has received approximately $\$1.2$ million from the Advanced Transportation and Congestior Management Technologies Deployment (ATCMTD) Program to build EV charging stations throughout the state.

# North Dakota's EVVision  

A reliable, safe, accessible, and resilient transportation system which interconnects to the nationwide EV network and improves the quality of life for North Dakota citizens and the traveling public, while promoting economic development  

# Goals  

· A complete build-out of existing alternative fuel corridors (AFC) by 2026   
● Maximize available federal funds to create an interconnected fast-charging system that supports regional, national and international travel.   
· A comprehensive system that helps provide the traveling public with safe, convenient access to a variety of transportation and energy options.   
· Establish, to the extent feasible, public-private partnerships (P3s) for the installation and operation of EV charging infrastructure.  

# NEVI Program Background  

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), passed in 2021, has dedicated funds available for the development of electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure. As part of the BlL, the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program will distribute five billion dollars $(\$58)$ over the next five years (FY 2022-2026) to state departments of transportation for the development of DC fast charging (DcFC) infrastructure. This infrastructure is intended to serve long-distance EV travel along alternative fuel corridors (AFCs).  

To access NEVI funds, North Dakota was required to submit a plan by August 1, 2022 (and updated each year after), demonstrating how the network will meet requirements set by the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Department of Transportation's Joint Office for EV Infrastructure Deployment. The Joint Office has indicated that by the end of the five-year Feedback(+) erstates should be fully built out, and the remainder of the funding can be dedicated to other priority corridors

# Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO)  

It is anticipated that two rounds of funding will be released. NDDOT has released the first Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) package on June 11, 2024, with proposals due August 9, 2024. Interested parties will be responsible for developing teams to construct, own, operate, and maintain the charging infrastructure.

# NEVI Program Networking Opportunities  

NDDOT will be seeking teams through a competitive process to host, build, own, operate, and maintain the infrastructure, with the station remaining privately owned after the five-year funding program expires. The program will pay up to $80\%$ Oofthe project costs, which may include operations and maintenance and the cost of electricity and demand charges.  

NDDOT is facilitating the following networking opportunities to connect potential EV charging station hosts with equipment manufacturers, charging services, electrical contractors, utilities, and other service providers who may want to partner in developing an EV charging station.

# NEVl-Funded Charging Infrastructure Locations  

Under federal law, it is not legal to sell power from highway right-of-way (including rest areas), making these areas unsuitable for charger locations. NDDOT is anticipating that infrastructure willbe built on private sites within one mile of the AFCs (l-29 and I-94), through strong partnerships with the private sector to host, operate, and maintain the charging locations.  

NDDoT is anticipating that stations will be located within clusters (one station will be awarded per cluster), defined as one or more exits along the state's AFCs that fulfill the maximum 50-mile spacing requirement. This approach will balance the need for efficient spacing of charging infrastructure while increasing the number of sites that can participate. Proposals will be evaluated and scored against only those from within the same cluster.  

# Preparation for potential site hosts  

Until the NOFO is released, property owners or potential site hosts can perform several tasks (at their own cost) to prepare for the application process. Please note any costs incurred before award are not eligible for reimbursement.  

· Verify your property or potential host location are within a NDDOT site cluster and within a one-mile drive from the F shown on GIS map above.   
· Begin researching and communicating with DC Fast Charge equipment manufacturers.   
· Begin familiarizing yourself with FHWA requirements and proposed rulemaking for DC Fast Charge stations. o  Federal Highway Administration - NEVI Fact Sheets 0 Federal Highway Administration - Electric Vehicles Overview 0  Federal Highway Administration - NEVI Formula Program Guidance
