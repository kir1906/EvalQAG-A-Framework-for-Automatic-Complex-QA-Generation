# Pay-for-Savings incentives  

The Sponsors of Mass Save® provide energy efficiency incentives for incorporating high-performance upgrades into the renovations and additions (R&A) of existing homes, or new construction homes that meet our eligibility requirements within Sponsor service territories.\* Incentives are determined by calculating the amount of electric savings and fuel savings (natural gas, propane, or oil) and comparing the overall performance of the home to that of the average new home in Massachusetts. We call this incentive structure our Pay-for-Savings approach.  

• To calculate incentives, HERS raters create a whole-house, energy-use model of your home and compare it agains a model of an average Massachusetts home.   
• To qualify for incentives, your home must have a minimum of $15\%$ savings above baseline for low-rise new construction projects, and $5\%$ savings above baseline per unit for R&A projects.   
• We enter electric and fuel savings and a total savings percentage into the following formula to determine your incentive:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Single-family incentive calculation</td><td colspan="2">Multi-family incentive calculation</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>Electric savings x $0.50/kwh</td><td>A</td><td>Electric savings x $0.50/kwh</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>Fuel savings x $5o/MMBtu</td><td>B</td><td>Fuel savings x $5o/MMBtu</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>Savings percentage x $4,000</td><td>C</td><td>Savings percentage x $2,500</td></tr><tr><td>Total participant incentive</td><td>A+B+C</td><td>Total participant incentive</td><td>A+B+C</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">HERS raters receive $350 for low-rise, single-family projects and a $350 bonus for units that meet or exceed a 30%totalsavingspercentage.HERSratersreceive$7oofor R&A single-family projects and a $3oo bonus when a final blowerdoortestiscompleted.</td><td colspan="2">HERS raters receive $1oo/unit for low-rise, multi-family a3o%totalsavingspercentage.HERSratersreceive $10o/unitforR&Amulti-familyhomesanda$3oobonus whenafinalblowerdoortestiscompleted.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

• An incentive cap of $\$10,000$ per unit is applied.  

• Homes that receive an ENERGY STAR® Homes designation receive an additional incentive: $\$100$ for a single-family home and $\$25$ /unit for a multi-family home.  

• Single-family and multi-family designations are as follows:  

- We define single-family homes as a single-family detached house or each unit in a standalone building with 2 to 4 units.  

• Master-metered buildings are not eligible for multi-family, three stories or less, incentives. However, they may be eligible for multi-family, four stories or more, incentives. Our technical team will evaluate master-metered buildings to determine eligibility. Please contact multifhr@icf.com with any questions.
