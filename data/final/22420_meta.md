 ## Summary : 
 The Energy Infrastructure Revolving Loan Program (EIRLP) was established in
2021 by legislation (S.F. 619) as a replacement for the previous Alternate
Energy Revolving Loan Program

The program offers low-interest financing for innovative energy infrastructure
projects. The [program
handbook](https://www.iowaeda.com/userdocs/programs/resources/EIRLP-
Handbook-112023.pdf) provides examples of eligible technology and project
types; the examples are intended to be illustrative, not exhaustive.

Projects must serve one or more of seven listed project purposes in order to
qualify. These purposes are: 1) electric or gas generation, transmission,
storage, or distribution; 2) electric grid modernization; 3) energy sector
workforce development; 4) emergency preparedness for rural and underserved
areas; 5) expansion of biomass, biogas, and renewable natural gas; 6)
innovative technologies; and 7) development of infrastructure for alternative
fuel vehicles.

The program is accepting applications on a quarterly basis, with no more than
$10 million to be distributed each quarter.

Quarterly application deadlines for 2024 were/are January 25, April 18, July
11, and October 17.
