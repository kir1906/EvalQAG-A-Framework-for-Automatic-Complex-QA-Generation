# Alabama National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program – FY2024 Plan  

Approved by FHWA October 25, 2023  

# Introduction  

This is the first version of the Alabama Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Plan that is following the template. This change is in response to a request from FHWA for the State to follow the NEVI State Plan Template.  

# Updates from Prior Plan  

This current NEVI plan follows the Joint Office template. The previously approved plan (Summer 2022 Alabama Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Plan) had combined details of Alabama’s statefunded program with the Alabama NEVI Implementation Plan.   
• The Plan Vision and Goals are now explicitly stated within the context of NEVI.   
• More discussion has been added about how the State of Alabama engages the general public and disadvantaged communities, as part of its public engagement strategy. This includes a new listing of Drive Electric Alabama events that are considered a major component of the public engagement process since they all provided opportunities to learn about EVs and, additionally, the State of Alabama’s EV Infrastructure Planning process. More detail is provided on the Contracting approach and how the state will encourage participation from small businesses. Additional discussion has been added relative to Alabama’s role in the oversight of grantees to help ensure public engagement is occurring and that grantees meet program requirements. Discussion of Program Evaluation includes specific goals, metrics, desired outcomes and targets under Alabama’s NEVI program.  

# State Agency Coordination  

Memoranda of Understanding with other agencies  

On July 11, 2022, the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA) worked with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to execute an agreement enabling ADECA to administer Alabama’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program.  

# Interagency Working Group(s)  

Personnel in ADECA’s Energy Division coordinate regularly with ALDOT through its Chief Engineer to help meet program goals and requirements. ALDOT also participates in the Alabama EV Advisory Group along with multiple other state agencies.  

ADECA shares information on new and developing EV charging infrastructure grant programs with other state agency leaders as requested and proactively shares other relevant information. As an example, ADECA provided information to multiple state agency leaders making them aware of their eligibility to apply for funding from the new federal Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant Program.  

Approved by FHWA October 25, 2023  

State agencies and offices participating in Alabama’s EV infrastructure planning process include the Office of the Governor, Alabama Department of Environmental Management, Alabama Department of Agriculture & Industries, Alabama Department of Commerce, Alabama Department of Labor, Alabama Department of Finance, Alabama Department of Transportation, Alabama Tourism Department, and the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.  

# Public Engagement  

ADECA’s Energy Division continuously seeks public engagement as part of its Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Program. ADECA seeks and considers input from a broad, diverse, and growing base of EVinterested stakeholders through an Alabama EV Advisory Group that was first established in 2020.  

The Alabama EV Advisory Group has now been expanded to include 66 individuals representing 50 different organizations. Below is a list of organizations represented as of July 2023. This group and its subcommittees are involved in multiple evolving aspects of the State’s EV infrastructure planning process.

To ensure that four specific and critical areas receive focused attention, the Alabama EV Advisory Group has formed the following four subcommittees that meet throughout the year.  

# Alabama EV Advisory Group Subcommittees:  

Utility Subcommittee   
Equity Considerations Subcommittee   
Labor and Workforce Considerations Subcommittee   
Public Engagement and Collaborative Funding Opportunities Subcommittee  

ADECA makes its Energy Division program staff and its EV consultant available upon request, and they each seek opportunities to engage communities as part of the EV infrastructure planning process. Regularly scheduled  EV Advisory Group meetings provide a recurring forum for discussion of major industry developments and specific aspects of the NEVI planning process.  

# Community Engagement Outcomes Report  

ADECA plays a primary role in a statewide public education initiative called Drive Electric Alabama. The initiative is dedicated to improving the state through the adoption of electric vehicles. Drive Electric Alabama themed events have been organized by community-based partners and include broad messaging to the general public that electric vehicles are increasingly practical, that the EV manufacturing supply chain is creating Alabama-based jobs, and that EV ownership can save people money, make their lives more convenient, and reduce their vehicle emissions.  

Drive Electric Alabama has created multiple opportunities for the general public to receive additional education on electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Drive Electric Alabama engages consumers through various methods, including billboards along rights-of-way, social media, television advertising, radio advertising, and specific in-person and online events. These events have catalyzed additional interest. As of June 2023,  Drive Electric Alabama had generated approximately 260 earned media stories, reaching a Nielsen audience of 994,316 with a calculated publicity value of $\$498,924$ . Drive Electric Alabama has also documented 979,048 Facebook accounts reached; 88,692 Instagram accounts reached; 42,988 Twitter users engaged; and over 3.7 million views on YouTube.  

Drive Electric Alabama’s community engagement was boosted through a sponsored advertising partnership between the non-profit Alabama Clean Fuels Coalition and the Alabama Broadcasters Association. The Public Education Partnership (PEP) campaign delivered 7,762 television commercials and 23,247 radio advertisements over a fourteen month period. The campaign also documented 36.7 million digital impressions and 21,000 online clicks on educational messaging through the Google Ad Network and YouTube.  

A two-day, in-person EV Summit was held September 21-22, 2022 and planning for a second EV Summit has tentatively been planned for August 14-15, 2024.  

Drive Electric Alabama branded in-person outreach events are held with increasing frequency across all areas of the state.

# Tribal Engagement  

Creek Indian Enterprises Development Authority has a representative serving on the Alabama EV Advisory Group and the Equity Considerations Subcommittee. Projects located on tribal land or at a facility owned or operated by a federally recognized tribe will receive extra points in the Alabama NEVI scoring process.  

# Utility Engagement  

All of Alabama’s electric utilities are represented on the Alabama EV Advisory Group and its Utility Subcommittee meets frequently. As critical partners to the process, the state often depends on the individual and collective expertise of these entities to support the planning process. Utility incentives for charging infrastructure offered by electric utilities will be allowed as eligible sources of matching funds in NEVI funded projects. Applications for NEVI projects in Alabama will require an engineering and construction site assessment to be completed by the Applicant which will identify the electric utility involved in each project early in the process.  

# Site-Specific Public Engagement  

Grant Agreements with each successful Applicant to Alabama’s NEVI program will authorize future site-specific public engagement. Alabama will, through ADECA, directly engage the public to make them aware of sites selected for NEVI projects. Applicants with proactive public engagement plans will receive additional points in the Alabama NEVI scoring process.  

# Plan Vision and Goals  

To establish a convenient, affordable, reliable, and equitable statewide EV network, Alabama intends to obligate funds through multiple rounds of competitive grants. While the state will have direct involvement in each project for a period of five years, it is expected that grantees will be solely responsible for the operation and maintenance of stations beyond the five-year NEVI-supported period. Applicants who express a commitment to operate the station beyond five years will be awarded more points in the scoring process.  

Some of these funds may also be used for labor and workforce training, planning, outreach, administration, and other activities as approved by ADECA and allowed by law. Neither the state nor ADECA is obligated to award all the funds to Projects.  Any such training could only be utilized in place of the EVITP if and when such programs are approved by the Department of Labor per the 23 CFR 680.106(j).  

The following table shows NEVI Program dollars available or expected to become available under Alabama’ NEVI Program.  

Once NEVI corridors are fully built out, ADECA intends to work through the EV Advisory Group to establish a  

Approved by FHWA October 25, 2023  

program to ensure that remaining funds are deployed to provide the most possible benefit and to fill additiona remaining charging gaps.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained or implied herein, it is recognized that, pursuant to a Waiver of Buy America Requirements for Electric Vehicle Chargers (see 88 Fed. Reg. 10619 (Feb. 21, 2023)), the FHWA established a temporary public interest waiver to waive Buy America requirements for steel, iron, manufactured products, and construction materials in EV chargers. The short-term, temporary waiver enables EV charger acquisition and installation to immediately proceed while also ensuring the application of Buy America to EV chargers by the phasing out of the waiver over time. The waiver applies to all EV chargers manufactured by July 1, 2024, whose final assembly occurs in the United States and whose installation has begun by October 1, 2024. The second phase of the waiver will apply to all EV chargers manufactured on and after July 1, 2024, whose final assembly occurs in the United States, and for which the cost of components manufactured in the United States is at least $55\%$ of the cost of all components. However, EV charger housing components that are predominantly steel and iron are excluded from the waiver and must meet current FHWA Buy America requirements. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has approved an exemption relieving federal agencies from the historic preservation review requirements under the National Historic Preservation Act Approved by FHWA October 25, 2023 8 regarding the effects of the installation of certain EVSE on historic properties. The exemption became effective as of October 26, 2022 (see Exemption from Historic Preservation Review for Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment, 87 Fed. Reg. 66201 (Nov. 2, 2022)).  

In the event of any conflict between ADECA’s Application Guide, the NEVI Final Rule, the FHWA NEVI Program Guidance, the FHWA Formula Program Frequently Asked Questions, and NIST Handbook 44-2023, Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices, all as may be amended, supplemented, restated or replaced, the provisions which are most stringent upon the Applicant and/or the Project shall apply.

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and implementing regulations, apply to the NEVI Program to ensure that no person shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.  

All applicable requirements of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Fair Housing Act), and implementin regulations, apply to the NEVI Program.  

ADECA will require its subrecipients to submit the contractors’ plan to comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and implementing regulations and the applicable requirements of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Documentation to support compliance with the plan should accompany requests for payment. In addition, ADECA will monitor compliance with applicable Civil Rights laws and regulations during the formal monitoring review of each project.  

# Existing and Future Conditions Analysis  

The greatest known risks and challenges to EV deployment in Alabama are the lack of reliable and publicly accessible charging infrastructure and the cost of purchasing a new vehicle. Forty-four percent $(44\%)$ of respondents to a survey conducted by the Regional Planning Commission of Greater Birmingham indicated they are not likely to consider buying an electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle for their next vehicle, citing lack of charging stations $(41\%)$ and the initial cost of purchasing an electric vehicle $(36\%)$ as the primary challenges.  

Electric vehicles are impacting Alabama’s economy in a very positive way. The Alabama Department of Commerce reports that recent investments in EV lines, battery manufacturing and its supply chain, EV battery recycling, and EV battery charging technology in Alabama amount to $\$2.1$ billion and account for 2,438 jobs.

The following map depicts how hurricane evacuation routes could potentially be served by EV charging stations.  

To accommodate the possibility of mass evacuation events, it is desirous to have stations spaced more Approved by FHWA October 25, 2023 14 frequently and with more charging ports than the minimum required to achieve FHWA EV Charging CorridorReady designation. The tagged locations depicted are not intended to depict specific locations. As noted above, Applicants proposing NEVI stations that serve eligible evacuation routes will be awarded additional points in the Alabama NEVI scoring process.

Alabama also intends to explore the possibility of making accessible some portable, possibly trailer-mounted, DC Fast charging units that could be utilized along hurricane evacuation routes.  

Electric Utilities are constantly evaluating load growth and shifting to proactively meet customers’ needs to continue to deliver safe, reliable, and affordable electricity. EV related load considerations including on-peak vs  

Approved by FHWA October 25, 2023  

off-peak energy requirements, seasonal variations, peak usage events, use and differences between residential/commercial/industrial charging technologies, power levels, and vehicle energy requirements are all considered during utility planning processes. It is vital to note large scale EV adoption will not occur overnight. It will take time and sustained effort to transition our transportation sector towards large scale electrification. Consumers should have confidence through coordinated planning criteria and management processes, that utilities are working today to meet the changing electrical needs over the long term for their customers. Locally, each customer and business specific site can be unique regarding utility service capacity/access and other factors.

# State Geography, Terrain, Climate and Land Use Patterns  

The climate for the entire State of Alabama is considered Humid Subtropical. Below are maps indicating Alabama’s average annual temperatures considered warm to hot with average rainfall in the state between 50 and 64 inches annually. Most of the state is considered at low elevations with high mountains and low valleys to the north and coastal beaches to the south. Alabama can experience extreme weather events in the form of tornadoes and hurricanes each year. These climate factors were all considered when determining the overall framework for EVSE in Alabama.

# Alternative Fuel Corridor (AFC) Designations  

Alabama plans to issue a Round 1 NEVI Request for Applications in September 2023 to make FY2022 NEVI funds available for obligation. Eligible locations in Round 1 will be any exit along any Alabama Interstate. A map showing eligible corridors with areas that will receive high priority consideration due to their ability to close a critical corridor gap highlighted. Alabama previously designated 1,002 miles of Interstate (65, 165, 565, 20, 59, 359, 459, 759, 85,10, 22) as EV Charging – Corridor Pending during Rounds 1-6 of FHWA Corridor nominations.  

Alabama sought and received input through its EV Advisory Group and that were learned about through public engagement efforts of community-based organizations and nominated additional corridors that were recommended. Round 7 nominated corridors, if approved, will greatly increase access to EV charging infrastructure opportunities in all areas of the state especially in lower income and majority-minority areas.  

Alabama’s Round 7 nomination proposed an additional 1,231.3 miles of EV Charging Corridor-Pending corridors which included the segments of US43, 80, 231, 280, 331, and 431 that are part of the National Highway System.  

During each NEVI funding round, Alabama intends to accept Applications for NEVI projects at any location along any NEVI eligible corridor. Applications will be reviewed and scored against each other using a listing of required and optional project elements. Projects that fill critical gaps in EV charging along AFC’s will be given high priority status for selection. The scoring process will also take into account how station redundancy may be needed in areas due to factors that could include, but will not be limited to, dense population, higher rates of EV ownership, hurricane evacuation route status, the number of designated corridors served by a station, and whether or not a proposed site is within a Justice40 area.  

Before nominating any additional corridors during any future round of FHWA alternative fuel corridor nominations, Alabama will consider the estimated impact of nominating those corridors on the build out cost to achieve EV Charging Corridor – Ready status. The amount of funding expected to be available is more than sufficient to achieve this built-out status for corridors nominated during Rounds 1-7, assuming Applicant interest in siting projects along these corridors.  

The following map depicts all existing FHWA EV Charging-Corridor Pending routes in red and Round 7 corridors recently nominated highlighted in blue.

# TABLE of Existing DCFC In Close Proximity to FHWA Round 1-7 Alabama EV Charging Corridors  

NEVI Corridors include ALL Alabama Interstates since they were successfully designated during FHWA Rounds 1-6 of alternative fuel corridor nominations. On June 20, 2023, Alabama nominated sections of US43, US80, US280, US231, US331, and US431 listed on the National Highway System as part of Round 7. The table below lists all known DCFC located along Round 1-7 corridors as of July 10, 2023. Individual maps of each corridor follow this table. Higher resolution PDFs and map files will be made available upon emailed request to ev@adeca.alabama.gov. Applicants will be asked to calculate the driving distance from the location of any project they are proposing to the nearest stations along the same Corridor/Route as the location of the proposed project. Additional DC Fast charging stations listed on the National Alternative Fuels Data Center, or AFDC, at the time of application should also be considered. The AFDC may be accessed at afdc.energy.gov by clicking the “Locate Stations” tab. A more direct link to the DC Fast Charging inventory in Alabama follows:  AFDC Listing of DC Fast Charging Stations in Alabama  

Please notify EV@adeca.alabama.gov of any updates needed to the data in this table. Station owners and operators are also strongly encouraged to list their facilities on the AFDC. To add your facility, go to the following link: https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/#/station/new

# EV Charging Infrastructure Deployment  

Successful Applicants will be required to provide minimum matching funding of not less than $20\%$ of Project Eligible Costs, and $100\%$ of Ineligible Costs. Anything over a match of $20\%$ of Project Eligible Costs may result in additional scoring points. For the avoidance of doubt, funding of Ineligible Costs cannot be used as the required $20\%$ match.  

Eligible match sources will include, but not be limited to, cash, loans, other (non-federal) grants, in-kind contributions, or capital assets dedicated to the Project.  

All Eligible Funds claimed for a Project must be supported with documentation that demonstrates the Eligible Funds are available. Applicants will be required to detail their approach to design and permitting for permits that could include air/land use, electrical, structural, zoning, local agency, environmental, etc.  

# Planned Charging Stations  

No stations are currently under construction or planned that utilize NEVI program funds. Alabama will include all eligible corridors as eligible project locations during each future round of NEVI Applications.  

Each NEVI-supported charging station located along and designed to serve users of designated AFCs must have at least four network-connected Society of Automotive Engineers Combined Charging System (CCS) Type 1 connectors and four network-connected North American Charging Standard (NACS) connectors and be capable of simultaneously charging at least four (4) EVs. Each DCFC port must be capable of charging CCS-compliant and NACS-compliant vehicles (but not simultaneously), and each DCFC port must have at least one permanently attached CCS Type 1 connector (Type 1 Connector) and one NACS connector. In addition, not more than one permanently attached CHAdeMO (www.chademo.com) connector can be provided using only FY2022 NEVI Program funds.  

A graphic from the Alternative Fuels Data Center is pasted below to illustrate and differentiate between ‘ports’, ‘connectors’, and ‘stations.’  Applicants may reference this image to ensure they are depicting the correct numbers of ports and connectors at each station.

# Planning Towards a Fully Built Out Determination  

Alabama will have approximately 2,300 miles of NEVI eligible corridors. If NEVI projects are approved along every corridor at least every 50 miles, approximately 46 stations would be necessary. This number would be reduced by stations serving multiple corridors. This number would also increase after accounting for areas where additional capacity (redundancy) may be deemed appropriate.  

Alabama’s NEVI scoring process will be designed to fill critical gaps as the highest priority and to meet any redundancy needs as another high priority. Redundancy may be needed for reasons that could include but will not be limited to, dense population, higher rates of EV ownership, hurricane evacuation route status, the number of designated corridors served by a station, and whether or not a proposed site is within a Justice40 area.  

Approved by FHWA October 25, 2023  

# Implementation  

To ensure ongoing operations and maintenance of EV charging infrastructure, beginning in 2024, successful Applicants will be required to submit a maintenance and repair report for each operational NEVI-supported charging station for the previous year.  

The charging infrastructure must also have a minimum manufacturer’s hardware warranty of five (5) years and continually be in full working order to the extent possible. Manufacturers and/or suppliers under these specifications will be required to provide warranties covering a minimum of five (5) years for all chargers and equipment from the time of Notice of Acceptance.  

Project materials and manufactured components employed in the construction of charging stations, transformers, connectors, and other project components shall be certified in accordance with an approval process adopted by ADECA, which shall include but not be limited to, certification by the manufacturer and testing performed by the contractor or manufacturer. Any materials or manufactured components delivered/installed in the project that are not certified and approved will be subtracted from any progress payment until such requirements are met.  

Should repair or replacement be necessary, the charging station shall be fully operating within 72 hours of equipment issue/breakdown to ensure an average $97\%$ annual uptime guarantee. Exceptions include outages that are outside of the charging station operator’s control (provided the charging station’s operator can demonstrate that the charging port and related connectors would otherwise be operational) including:  electric utility service interruptions, failure to charge or meet the EV charging customer’s expectation for power delivery due to the fault of the vehicle, scheduled maintenance, vandalism, or natural disasters.  

Evacuation needs are addressed in more detail in the Existing and Future Conditions Analysis section of this plan.  

Costs for manufacturer’s hardware warranties and software network and scheduled maintenance agreements may be Eligible Costs; provided all Eligible Costs not incurred prior to the Notice of Acceptance desired to be reimbursed must be reasonably estimated in good faith at the time the Application is submitted.  

# Equity Considerations  

# Identification and Outreach to Disadvantaged Communities (DACs) in the State  

he State of Alabama continues to make outreach to Justice40 areas in the state a priority. The following are just some xamples of how the State is ensuring $40\%$ of the benefits of NEVI funds will reach those in Justice40 communities.  

Equity Considerations Subcommittee – As part of the EV Advisory Group’s work, ADECA established an Equity Considerations Subcommittee in 2022 to oversee our work and to ensure that Justice40 considerations were at the forefront of all of our NEVI plans. This subcommittee includes the Director of Alabama Governor’s Office of Minority Affairs, the President/CEO of the Creek Indian Enterprises Development Authority (CIEDA), a team member from the Economic Development Partnership of Alabama, the Executive Director of Conservation Alabama, the Interim Executive Director of the Alabama Transportation Institute, the President-Elect of Grow Southeast Alabama, the Lead Equity and Environmental Justice team member for the Alabama Clean Fuels Coalition, and the newly added Community Engagement Liaison for the Black Belt Region of Alabama from the Alabama Clean Fuels Coalition.  

• Community Engagement Liaison for the Black Belt Area – As the EV consultant for the State of Alabama, the Alabama Clean Fuels Coalition recognized the need for outreach in the Black Belt region of our state. The following are some statistics to support ACFC’s addition of an engagement liaison in the Black Belt: the labor force participation rate has been 20 percentage points lower than the rest of Alabama for nearly three decades; the unemployment rate has been several points higher than the rest of Alabama for decades; the counties in the Black Belt region have lower than state average internet access rates; the Black Belt has the highest population  

Approved by FHWA October 25, 2023  

in the state with only a high school education ( $39\%$ compared to $31\%$ statewide); and due to the mostly rural aspect of the Black Belt, people in this region generally have to drive much longer distances to access healthcare. Due to the high concentration of Justice40 communities in this region of the state, increased engagement will provide us the opportunity to engage on both EVs and workforce development in the EV realm.  

• In the Community Engagement Outcomes Report section of this plan, there is a comprehensive list of EV showcase events that have been held in the state. Multiple of these locations are in Justice40 areas in Alabama. These include events held in Birmingham, Huntsville, the greater Montgomery area, and Mobile. Below are several maps showing these locations in relation to Justice40 areas.

Japanese Gardens, Mobile, AL (Adjacent to Justice40)  

Rural Resource Call – the State holds Rural Resource calls every week to ensure rural municipalities and counties are up to date on things going on in the state. During the April 2023 call, the Alabama Clean Fuels Coalition spoke on this call to reach rural communities regarding the State’s plans for NEVI and an EV charging network.  

• Nomination of EV-pending corridors in Justice40 areas to add NEVI chargers in Justice40 areas – The map below shows the Round 7 corridor nominations for Alabama. This map is overlaid with the Justice40 area map of the state. These nominations were strategic in reaching Justice40 areas in our state that could not be reached by Interstate corridors alone.

• If a charging station project is located in or adjacent to a Justice40 area, the Application will receive more points in Alabama’s NEVI scoring process.  

• As part of our in-depth discussions with the Equity Considerations Subcommittee, the State will be holding NEVI-specific lunch and learns and other outreach events in locations across the state to provide updates regarding the NEVI program and to seek ongoing feedback on the State’s NEVI plan.

# Labor and Workforce Considerations  

In compliance with 23 CFR 680.106(j) to ensure that the installation and maintenance of chargers is performed safely by a qualified and increasingly diverse workforce of licensed technicians and other laborers, all electricians installing, operating, or maintaining Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment must receive certification from the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program (EVITP) or a registered apprenticeship program for electricians that includes chargerspecific training developed as part of a national guideline standard approved by the Department of Labor in consultation with the Department of Transportation, if and when such programs are approved.  

Alabama workforce development experts are involved in the EV planning process through participation in Alabama’s EV Advisory Group and its Labor and Workforce Considerations and Utility Subcommittees. To ensure the workforce is trained in high quality training programs like the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program (EVITP) or otherwise comply with the qualified technician requirements in 23 CFR 680.106(j), it has been determined a significant need exists to further electrical worker training related to the installation and maintenance of EV charging infrastructure in Alabama. NEVI program FAQs were updated on 07/17/23 in response to an inquiry to the Joint Office from Alabama asking for confirmation of specific NEVI-eligible workforce development state-level activities. Based on this affirmation, Alabama is now considering its next steps to implement a program that may include,  but not necessarily be limited to, the following types of activities:  

(1) to cover registration expenses associated with electrical workers who complete a 20-hour online EVITP training course.  

(2) to install EV charging infrastructure for training purposes at state-based learning facilities where the charging infrastructure will be a critical component of electrical worker upskilling that is directly related to the proper installation, operation, and maintenance of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  

(3) to develop capacity at a state college level to deliver localized and in-person electrical worker upskilling directly related to the proper installation, testing, certification, operation and maintenance of electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the state.  Any such training could only be utilized in place of the EVITP if and when such programs are approved by the Department of Labor per the 23 CFR 680.106(j).  

(4) to pay direct expenses to cover costs associated with electrical workers taking the in-person training contemplated in #3 above.  

(5) to work with a third party to develop inspection capacity to confirm NEVI project installations are compliant with the NEVI program requirements.  

All electricians installing, operating, or maintaining EVSE (electric vehicle supply equipment) must meet one of the following requirements:  

(i) Certification from the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program (EVITP); or (ii) Graduation or a continuing education certificate from a registered apprenticeship program for electricians that includes charger-specific training and is developed as a part of a national guideline standard approved by the Department of Labor in consultation with the Department of Transportation.  

For projects requiring more than one electrician, at least one electrician must meet the requirements above, and at least one electrician must be enrolled in an electrical registered apprenticeship program.  

All other onsite, non-electrical workers directly involved in the installation, operation, and maintenance of chargers must have graduated from a registered apprenticeship program or have appropriate licenses, certifications, and training as required.  

Electrical contractors may apply for a reimbursement grant through the Alabama Construction Industry Craft Training Board (CICTB) that will cover the training program fee for their employees that need to be trained. Click on the following link to apply Alabama Construction Industry Craft Training (alcict.com). Please note the CICTB opportunity for electrical contractors does NOT involve any funding from Alabama or the NEVI program, it is a privately sponsored opportunity. Please also note that grant approval must be in place with CICTB before electrical contractor employees apply/pay for the training program. Utility co-ops and municipalities cannot apply for CICTB grants as they are not electrical contractors. Co-ops and municipalities have existing mechanisms through which they support the training needs of their employees.  

# Physical Security & Cybersecurity  

Successful Applicants will be required to implement physical and cybersecurity strategies to ensure charging station operations protect consumer data and protect against the risk of harm to, or disruption of, charging infrastructure and the grid. Physical security strategies should include topics such as lighting, siting, and station design to ensure visibility from onlookers, driver and vehicle safety, video surveillance, emergency call boxes, fire prevention, charger locks, and strategies to prevent tampering and illegal surveillance of payment devices. Cybersecurity strategies should include the following topics:  user identity and access management; cryptographic agility and support of multiple PKIs; monitoring and detection; incident prevention and handling; configuration, vulnerability, and software update management; thirdparty cybersecurity testing and certification; and continuity of operation when communication between the charger and charging network is disrupted. EV charging infrastructure should be operated and maintained with a focus on public road safety, including the provision of adequate lighting, fire protection, and other traffic safety features. Potential conflicts with non-motorized and public transportation travel in multi-modal corridors should be addressed through safe design and countermeasures.  

# Program Evaluation  

Alabama is committed to continuing to monitor and report progress annually in updated state plans. Alabama will also collect all other data and information required by the program. Alabama is considering options to establish a more formal process to conduct site visits during project installation and throughout the term of each NEVI-supported station to evaluate whether installations and maintenance efforts are conducted in accordance with program requirements.  

# Discretionary Exceptions  

Alabama has no current requests for discretionary exceptions. When sites are identified that meet or exceed program goals, they will be considered and submitted for approval using the exception request form provided by the Joint Office.
