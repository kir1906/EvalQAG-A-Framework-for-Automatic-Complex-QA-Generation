EWEB aims to expand Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), commonly called "charging station", in our community through our Smart Charge rebates for qualifying public charging stations.  

Our rebates support the following types of stations:  

# Multifamily commercial grade level 2  

Funding for this program is in part made possible by the Oregon Clean Fuels Program (CFP) administered by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ).  

Installing an EVSE can be highly variable in scope and costs. Visit our Charging Options page to learn more.  

#  

Start working with an electrician/contractor and determine if the current electrical service capability is sufficient or if potential upgrades are needed to support the EVSE installation. Contact EWEB Distribution Engineering at distributionengineering@eweb.org to communicate the potential addition of new load from your charging station project. The added electric load of installing EV charging stations may result in costs for upgrading facilities such as transformers, conductors, or other equipment upstream from your service. If the EWEB engineering analysis confirms that equipment must be upgraded to accommodate the added electric load, the Customer will be responsible for these charges related to upgrading the equipment, per EWEB Electrical Utility Operational Policies. This is a separate process from the commercial Smart Charge rebate program.  

Select EVSE to be installed.  

# Apply online.  

An account manager will contact you to review your project.   
Receive EWEB pre-approval for your project. Pre-approval reserves funding for the proposed project.   
Install the EVSE.   
Submit EVSE spec sheets, and copies of the invoices for the qualifying EVSE (hardware and software) and installation work.  

Submit documentation of any applicable and additional grants or rebates from other entities and/or programs; the EWEB rebate is not to exceed $100\%$ of the cost of the EVSE (hardware and software) and its installation, including any additional grants or rebates that decrease the total project cost. Applications and supplemental documents can be emailed to ems.answers@eweb.org. EWEB may request a pre or post-inspection of the project to verify compliance with program requirements. The rebate check will be sent directly to the applicant 4-6 weeks after approval.

We offer the following rebates:  

New commercial grade public level 2 EVSE for multifamily housing site buildings (5 residence units or more) may qualify for a $\$1,500$ rebate per port.   
New commercial grade level 2 EVSE for qualified multifamily affordable housing sites may be eligible for a $\$2,000$ rebate per port.

Entities providing public charging, including workplace, fleet, business and multifamily may qualify for additional revenue generation through the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality Clean Fuels Program.  The program allows EVSE operators to generate Clean Fuels credits, which can then be monetized. This is not an EWEB program. Visit DEQ's Clean Fuels Program website or contact OregonCleanFuels@deq.state.or.us to learn more.

The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality's Oregon Clean Vehicle and Charge Ahead Rebate programs can save Oregonians up to $\$7,500$ on the purchase or lease of a qualifying electric vehicle. All Oregonians can receive up to $\$2,500$ for the purchase or lease of a qualifying new EV. Low- and moderate-income Oregonians can save an additional $\$5,000$ on qualifying new or used EVs. Learn more and download an application on DEQ's website.  

If you are purchasing or leasing your car from a dealer, you may be able to receive your rebate at the time of purchase. DEQ has developed an interactive map to locate dealerships with this arrangement in place.

The Oregon Department of Transportation's Community Charging Rebates Program, helping to fund Level 2 electric vehicle projects in Oregon's communities, opens its next funding round on March 5, 2024 at 9 a.m.  

The rebate program reimburses some of the project costs of buying and installing Level 2 EV charging stations at multifamily homes, workplaces, and publicly accessible parking areas. The rebates range from \$4,500-\$5,500 per charging port or up to $75\%$ of eligible project costs, whichever is less.  

Visit the Community Charging Rebates Program webpage for more information, including guidelines, webinars, qualifications, and application details.  

Community Charging Rebates can be stacked EWEB EV charging infrastructure rebates.

The federal government's Zero Emission Vehicle Incentive Program means each automaker's eligible plug-in vehicles can receive a tax credit of up to $\$7,500$ (based on vehicle battery size) until 200,000 eligible vehicles per manufacturer are registered in the U.S. After this point, the credit for that particular vehicle will be reduced and phased out over time.  

As of April 2019, Tesla, Cadillac, and Chevrolet have reached 200,000 sales, so models now have a reduced tax credit value.  

In addition, home or business installations of electric vehicle charging stations can receive a tax credit of up to 30 percent of the cost of installation. For more information about claiming the credit, see IRS Form 8911, which is available on the IRS Forms and Publications website.
