 ## Summary : 
 **_Note:[The Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf#page=993)
created the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/) with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

The Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT) is the lead agency for Hawaii's
NEVI plan. HDOT will need to install twelve new charging stations along
interstates and designated AFCs to satisfy the NEVI fully built out
requirements. Hawaii's initial [NEVI
Plan](https://hidot.hawaii.gov/highways/files/2022/08/National-Electric-
Vehicle-Infrastructure-NEVI-Program-SUBJECT-TO-APPROVAL.pdf) was submitted to
the federal Joint Office of Energy and Transportation in July 2022, and its
[2023 Update](https://hidot.hawaii.gov/highways/files/2023/11/HDOT-2023-NEVI-
Plan-Update.pdf) was submitted in August 2023. In its update, Hawaii stated
that it is making discretionary exceptions for several sites based on limited
power availability and grid capacity. It also requested exceptions from the 50
mile rule for two sites: HI-19 Hilo to Waimea and HI-200 Hilo to Kona.

The first NEVI-funded charging station was opened in February 2024, consisting
of four 150-kW chargers at the Kahului Park and Ride on Kuihelani Highway.
