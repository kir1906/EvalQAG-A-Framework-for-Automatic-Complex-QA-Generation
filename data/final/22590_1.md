AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 67, Chapter 5 and Title 68, relative to the Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy and Resilience Act.  

BE IT ENACTEDBY THEGENERALASSEMBLY OFTHE STATE OF TENNESSEE:  

SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 68, is amended by adding the following as a new chapter:  

# 68-205-101.  

(a) This chapter is known and may be cited as the "Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy and ResilienceAct."  

(b) It is the intent of the general assembly to authorize the establishment of a commercial property assessed clean energy and storm resiliency (C-PACER) program that jurisdictions may voluntarily implement to ensure that free and willing owners of agricultural, commercial, industrial, and multifamily residential properties can obtain low-cost, long-term financing for qualifying improvements. By authorizing local governments to adopt C-PACER programs, the general assembly finds that a valid public purpose exists because the use of C-PACER will increase economic development, lower insurance costs, and lower disaster and emergency response and aid costs to local governments. C-PACER programs will also decrease energy and water costs and encourage energy and water sustainability.
