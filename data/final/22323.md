# EVsmart® Vehicle Charging Time of Use Rate  

# Want to enroll in the Vehicle Charging Time of Use Rate?  

BGE now offers a special time of use rate for electric vehicle (EV) charging. This customer pricing plan provides the benefit of reduced electric bills to customers who charge their EV during off-peak hours. In order to enroll, you must have an eligible electric vehicle (EV) or charging station available through WeaveGrid.  

If you drive 15,000 miles per year, you could save approximately $\$120$ per year by charging your electric vehicle during off-peak hours on the Vehicle Charging Time of Use Rate instead of the Standard Schedule R rate.  

# How Does This Work?  

With the Vehicle Charging Time of Use Rate, BGE residential customers can place their eligible electric vehicle or eligible charger on a time-of-use rate while the rest of their house remains on a standard electric rate. The benefit to EV owners would be significantly lower electric costs for charging their vehicles during off-peak hours (nights and weekends). Please check the eligibility criteria below to see if you qualify for the Vehicle Charging Time of Use Rate (EV/VC-TOU).
