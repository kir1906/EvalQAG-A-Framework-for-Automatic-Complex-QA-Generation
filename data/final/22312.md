Managers of commercial businesses and multi-unit dwelings are increasingly providing plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging stations to take advantage of the convenience and affordability of electric vehicles and to demonstrate their commitment to the environment. l&M has incentive programs to support Level 2 (240V) PEV charging in each of the sectors discussed below.

# SMALLCOMMERCIALBUSINESSINCENTIVES  

Existing small-commercial customers who average less than 4,500 kWh per month of electricity are eligible for $\$500$ incentive and a discounted off peak rate up to a $40\%$ reduction from our standard rate.  

To take advantage of this incentive you'l need a submeter from I&M between your electrical panel and PEV Level 2 (240V) charger and an Indiane registered employee-owned or company PEV. Public Level 2 PEV chargers not tied to an Indiana-registered PEV are not eligible.  

There is no fee to sign up. l&M will provide more information and detailed steps on the process once you apply.

# COMMERCIAL ANDINDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES AND MULTIUNIT DWELLINGSINCENTIVES  

Commercial and industrial and multi-unit dwellings (MUD) customers not eligible for the small commercial business incentive can take advantage of a separate I&M PEV incentive program for Level 2 (240V) PEV charging for employees, fleet and MUD residents. Public Level 2 PEV chargers not tied to an Indiana-registered PEV are not eligible.  

Under this program, l&M pays $\$250$ per charging port if you can provide power to eligible Level 2 PEV chargers from behind their own electrical panels.  

If a customer needs new electrical service from I&M for Level 2 PEV charging, l&M still can pay the customer $\$250$ per charging port if I&M's anticipated revenue from the charging meets I&M's state approved criteria for adding new service without customer investment.  

If l&M's anticipated revenue does not meet our standard state approved criteria, we can extend the timeline to 5-years in lieu of the $\$250$ per port payment to avoid customer investment.
