 ## Summary : 
 Community Solar in NC is governed by House Bill 589 Session Law 2017-192. Each
offering utility must file a plan with the Commission to offer a community
solar energy facility program for participation by its retail customers. Each
community solar facility must have at least five subscribers and no single
subscriber has more than a forty percent (40%) interest. Duke Progress and
Duke Energy must make this available on a first-come first-served basis until
the total nameplate generation of its community solar facilities is at least
40MW.  

Community solar energy facility projects may have a nameplate capacity of no
more than five megawatts (MW). Each subscription to the project shall be sized
to represent at least 200 watts (W) of the community solar energy facility's
generating capacity and to supply no more than one hundred percent (100%) of
the maximum annual peak demand of electricity of each subscriber at the
subscriber's premises. Program participants will receive credits on your
electric bill for the solar power produced by your subscription.
