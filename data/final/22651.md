Included are investor-owned electric utilities, municipal and State utilities, Federal electric utilities, and rural electric cooperatives.  

"Energy facility" means an energy storage facility, solar energy facility, or wind energy facility. An energy facility may be located on more than 1 parcel of property, including noncontiguous parcels, but shares a single point of interconnection to the grid.  

"Energy storage facility" means a system that absorbs, stores, and discharges electricity. Energy storage facility does not include either of the following:  

(i) Fossil fuel storage.   
(ii) Power-to-gas storage that directly uses fossil fuel inputs.

“Prime farmland” is defined in the same manner as is done by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resource Conservation Service and is shown in the online database by the same entity (see 7 CFR 657.5). Prime farmland means land that has the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops, and is also available for these uses (the land could be cropland, pastureland, rangeland, forest and, or other land, but not urban built-up land or water). It has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to economically produce sustained high yields of crops when treated and managed, including water management, according to acceptable farming methods. In general, prime farmlands have an adequate and dependable water supply from precipitation or irrigation, a favorable temperature and growing season, acceptable acidity or alkalinity, acceptable salt and sodium content, and few or no rocks. They are permeable to water and air. Prime farmlands are not excessively erodible or saturated with water for a long period of time, and they either do not flood frequently or are protected from flooding. Examples of soils that qualify as prime farmland are Palouse silt loam, 0 to 7 percent slopes; Brookston silty clay loam, drained; and Tama silty clay loam, 0 to 5 percent slopes.  

"Project labor agreement" means a prehire collective bargaining agreement with 1 or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and does all of the following:  

(i) Binds all contractors and subcontractors on the construction project through the inclusion of appropriate specifications in all relevant solicitation provisions and contract documents.   
(ii) Allows all contractors and subcontractors on the construction project to compete for contracts and subcontracts without regard to whether they are otherwise parties to collective bargaining agreements.   
(iii) Contains guarantees against strikes, lockouts, and similar job disruptions.   
(iv) Sets forth the effective, prompt, and mutually binding procedures for resolving labor disputes arising during the term of the project labor agreement.   
(v) Provides other mechanisms for labor-management cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern, including productivity, quality of work, safety, and health.   
(vi) Complies with all state and federal laws, rules, and regulations.  

"Repowering", with respect to an energy facility, means replacement of all or substantially all of the energy facility for the purpose of extending its life beyond its original contract. Repowering does not include repairs or replacements related to the ongoing operations that do not increase the capacity or energy output of the energy facility.  

“Specialty Crops” means land other than prime farmland that is used for the production of specific high value food and fiber crops. It has the special combination of soil quality, location, growing season, and moisture supply needed to economically produce sustained high quality and/or high yields of a specific crop when treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods. Examples of such crops are citrus, tree nuts, olives, cranberries, fruit, and vegetables. (Definition is adopted from the USDA definition of “Unique Farmland.”)  

"Solar energy facility" means a system that captures and converts solar energy into electricity, for the purpose of sale or for use in locations other than solely the solar energy facility property. Solar energy facility includes, but is not limited to, the following equipment and facilities to be constructed by an electric provider or independent power producer: photovoltaic solar panels; solar inverters; access roads; distribution, collection, and feeder lines; wires and cables; conduit; footings; foundations; towers; poles; crossarms; guy lines and anchors; substations; interconnection or switching facilities; circuit breakers and transformers; energy storage facilities; overhead and underground control; communications and radio relay systems and telecommunications equipment; utility lines and installations; generation tie lines; solar monitoring stations; and accessory equipment and structures.

# PRE-APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS AND CONSULTATION PROCEDURES  

# C-1 MEETING WITH CHIEF ELECTED OFFICIAL  

The applicant must offer to meet with each affected local unit’s (ALU) chief elected official11 to establish if the ALU has a compatible renewable energy ordinance (CREO). If the ALU has a CREO, then applicants must follow the ALU siting process in each ALU. CREOs are described in the following section of this attachment.  

The applicant’s offer to meet shall be delivered by email and by certified U.S. mail at least 60 days before the scheduled public meeting in each affected local unit (ALU). ALUs include the city, township, village, or county, exercising zoning jurisdiction over the project location.  Reasonable efforts to obtain email addresses for the CEO should be made by reviewing the website of the affected local unit and if necessary, by contacting the office of the ALU. A local unit of government in a zoned jurisdiction that does not exercise zoning jurisdiction is not considered an ALU.  

A copy of the offers to meet with the chief elected officials should be sent to the entire board or other legislative body of the ALU.  

The applicant may proceed as if there is not a CREO if the chief elected official has failed to respond to the offer to meet and has not provided notice of a CREO thirty days following receipt of the certified mail.  

# C-2 COMPATIBLE RENEWABLE ENERGY ORDINANCE NOTIFICATION  

CREO means an ordinance that provides for the development of energy facilities within the ALU, the requirements of which are no more restrictive than the provisions included in section 226(8) of PA 233.  

A CREO may be an ordinance for a single technology such as wind, solar, or energy storage facilities or it may be an ordinance that addresses multiple technology types.  To be considered a CREO, the ordinance must be no more restrictive than PA 233 section 226(8) for the technology type(s) addressed in the ordinance. An ALU is considered not to have a compatible renewable energy ordinance if it has a moratorium on the development of energy facilities in effect within its jurisdiction. If notification from chief elected official(s) from each ALU to the applicant states that the ALU has a CREO, then applicants must first file for approval with each ALU.  CREOs are not required in unzoned areas because there is no ALU exercising zoning jurisdiction in an unzoned area.  

When a local ordinance does not meet the definition of CREO, the applicant may still choose to follow the ALU siting process if the ALU process allows the facilities to be sited. If an applicant chooses to follow an ALU’s siting process, including a special land use approval process, a siting certificate from the MPSC is not required.  

For example, if an applicant wanted to site a hybrid project containing solar and storage facilities in an ALU, the local process should be utilized in any of the following circumstances:  

1. The ALU has a single ordinance that is a CREO addressing solar and storage facilities.   
2. The ALU has two separate ordinances that are CREOs addressing solar and storage facilities.  

If a project is being sited in an area that crosses jurisdictional boundaries and one of the ALUs does not notify the applicant that it has a CREO or after attempts to site the project in one or more ALUs have failed, the applicant may file for a certificate pursuant to PA 233. When a project crosses multiple jurisdictional boundaries and one or more ALUs have CREOs, and one or more ALUs do not have CREOs, or after attempts to site the project in ALUs have failed, the MPSC will review the entire project if an application is filed, including the portions of the project that are in areas with CREOs and areas without CREOs, including unzoned areas, if the facilities do not meet the minimum size thresholds without the inclusion of the unzoned areas. By stipulation of the parties in a contested case, particularly the ALU(s) and the applicant, the ALU’s approvals pursuant to an ALU siting process may be considered by the Commission for those portions of the project included in the stipulation.  

Resolving disputes between applicants and ALUs regarding CREOs is not within the Commission’s jurisdiction. Should an applicant apply for siting approval at the MPSC while it is in dispute with the ALU regarding whether its ordinance is a CREO, the ALU, the Staff, or another intervenor, may file a motion to dismiss or stay, which will be adjudicated by the administrative law judge pursuant to the Commission's rules of practice and procedure. The administrative law judge’s ruling could be appealed to the Commission pursuant to the Commission's rules of practice and procedure.  

The applicant should retain records of the notification from the chief elected officia regarding CREO status for later submission in a contested case.  

If an ALU would like to request the Commission to require the developer to obtain a siting certificate for the proposed facilities from the Commission pursuant to PA 233 Section 222(2), the ALU should send its request to the Commission by contacting LARA-MPSCEdockets@michigan.gov to the attention of the MPSC Executive Secretary and to the Staff at LARA-MPSC-Siting@michigan.gov with a copy of the request provided to the developer.  

# C-3 REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC NOTICE AND PUBLIC MEETINGS  

The applicant must hold a public meeting in each city and township where the proposed facilities are located before filing an application with the Commission except in cities and townships where at least one of the following is true:12  

• The ALU notified the applicant that it had a CREO, and the application was subsequently not reviewed promptly by the ALU (by the 120-day deadline or other deadline as agreed upon). The ALU notified the applicant that it had a CREO and subsequently denied the application despite the proposed project complying with the statute. The ALU notified the applicant that it had a CREO and later amends its CREO so that it imposes requirements more restrictive than Section 226(8).  

Public meetings must be held in each ALU; however, a public meeting held in a township is considered to be held in each village located within the township.  Exceptions due to a lack of appropriate facilities to hold required public meetings within the ALU where the project is located will be considered on a case-by-case basis upon a showing of a goodfaith effort to hold the meetings as close to the project as feasible.  

Unless otherwise requested by the chief elected official, the public meeting should start between 5:00 pm and 7:30 pm if held on a traditional workday of Monday through Friday.  

The public meetings should be recorded or transcribed for later submission as evidence in siting cases filed pursuant to PA 233.  

# C-3.1 PUBLIC NOTICE FOR PUBLIC MEETINGS  

The applicant shall provide a notice of the public meeting that includes the date, time, and location of the public meeting; a description and location of the proposed renewable energy and/or energy storage facilities; an internet site where the site plan is accessible to the public, and directions for submitting written comments to the applicant for those unable to attend the public meeting.  

The notice of public meeting provided by the applicant shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in each ALU unit or a comparable digital alternative at least 14 days prior to the public meeting(s). The applicant shall publish notice of the meeting in a newspaper of general circulation in the ALU(s) or in a comparable digital alternative.  

The public meeting notice shall be written in plain, nontechnical, and easily understood terms and shall contain a title that includes the name of the application and the words “NOTICE OF INTENT TO CONSTRUCT FACILITY”, with the words “WIND ENERGY”, “SOLAR ENERGY”, or “ENERGY STORAGE”, as applicable entered into the blank space.  

Additionally, the notice must be submitted to the clerk in each ALU at least 30 days in advance of the public meeting.  A copy must be provided to the MPSC by emailing LARAMPSC-Edockets@michigan.gov to the attention of the MPSC Executive Secretary and LARA-MPSC-Siting@michigan.gov on the same date in which the local clerk/s was provided notice.  

The Executive Secretary may provide further direction regarding public notice.  

# C-4 PRE-APPLICATION MEETING WITH STAFF  

Thirty days before filing an application for a certificate, the Applicant shall contact the Staff (Siting-Certificate-Coordinator@michigan.gov) to schedule a pre-application meeting to be held virtually using Microsoft Teams or other videoconferencing software.  During the meeting, the applicant will discuss the following:  

1. Overview of project.   
2. Map of project.   
3. Status of project.   
4. Labor and employment considerations.   
5. Expected application filing date.   
6. Questions related to the contested case process.   
7. Questions related to filing requirements.  

# 8. Other items of interest.  

ALUs that have renewable energy projects or energy storage projects proposed within their boundaries may request meetings with Staff by contacting the Staff (LARA-MPSCSiting@michigan.gov) to schedule a meeting to be held virtually using Microsoft Teams or other videoconferencing software.  Staff will answer questions regarding the contested case process, the filing requirements, and discuss other items of interest to ALU, however, consultations with Staff are not a substitute for the advice of counsel.  

# C-5 PUBLIC NOTICE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THE APPLICATION  

The applicant is required to provide public notice of the opportunity to comment on the application. This notice shall be filed as a public notice in a newspaper of general circulation in each ALU or in a comparable digital alternative. The notice shall be written in plain, nontechnical, and easily understood terms and shall contain a title that includes the name of the applicant and the words “NOTICE OF INTENT TO CONSTRUCT FACILITY,” with the words “WIND ENERGY,” “SOLAR ENERGY,” or “ENERGY STORAGE,” as applicable, entered into the blank space.  

The applicant shall also send the notice of the opportunity to comment on the application by U.S. mail to postal addressees within one mile of proposed solar or proposed energy storage facilities, and within two miles of proposed wind energy facilities, including to those addressees within those specified boundaries that are not located within the bounds of the ALU and local governments not exercising zoning authority where the facilities will be located.  

# C-6 TECHNICAL CONFERENCE  

The applicant shall work with Staff to hold a technical conference with invitations provided to all intervening parties and local governments not exercising zoning authority.  The technical conference may be held virtually and should be scheduled approximately 4 weeks following the pre-hearing.  

The purpose of the technical conference is to allow Staff and intervening parties to ask questions and view the site plan in an electronic format where the applicant can zoom in on specific areas.  The goal of the technical conference is to reduce the burden associated with multiple rounds of discovery questions and to allow for direct communication between case participants early in the case.

Table Page Table 1 Sound Modeling Parameters 49  

# D1.0    PRECONSTRUCTION SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS (Exhibit A-1.7)  

All sound studies shall be completed by or under the direction of a qualified noise control engineer. The preferred qualification is Board Certification through the Institute of Noise Control Engineering (INCE). If the preparer is not Board Certified, then qualifications shall be justified and submitted with the application. A professional engineering license alone is not sufficient qualification to prepare the preconstruction or postconstruction noise studies.  

The purpose of the preconstruction sound report is to provide the Commission with information necessary to assess whether the facility meets the noise limits defined in MI MCL 460.1226.  

# D1.1      Sound modeling (Exhibit A-1.7)  

# D1.1.1     Modeling Parameters  

Sound modeling shall be conducted following the requirements of ISO 9613-2 (2024), “Engineering method for the prediction of sound pressure levels outdoors.”  

For modeling wind turbine sound, ANSI/ACP 111-1 (2022), “Wind Turbine Sound Modeling,” and Annex D of ISO 9613-2 (2024) provide additional guidance for the calculation of sound pressure levels from wind turbines. Where any ambiguity exists, the parameters in Table 1 must be used.  

Table 1 Sound Modeling Parameters   


<html><body><table><tr><td>PARAMETER</td><td>VALUE</td></tr><tr><td>G (Ground factor)</td><td>0.0 over water and large areas of hard ground, 0.5 everywhere else</td></tr><tr><td>Modeling uncertainty adjustment</td><td>Minimum of +2 dB for wind projects, Minimumof+OdBforallothersources</td></tr><tr><td>Receptor/grid height</td><td>4.0 m for wind projects, otherwise, · 4.0 m for two- or more-story dwellings (default) If sound barriers are proposed, the height of the highest windowforeach dwelling</td></tr><tr><td>Source height</td><td>1.5 m for property boundaries and one-story dwellings For wind turbines, hub height.

13 MCL 460.1226 states that the noise limit is considered “at the nearest outer wall of the nearest dwelling.” In practice, this would be measured with a microphone mounted directly on the façade, that is, flush mounted on the vertical reflecting surface of a building. The pressure doubling at the surface with respect to the freefield condition leads to a 6 dB increase in sound level and is referred to as the “6-dB position” in ANSI S12.9 Part 3. Sound modeling conducted using ISO 9613-2 does not include the $^{+6}$ dB adjustment. Therefore, 6 dB must be added to the sound modeling results to reflect what would be measured at the façade.  

# D1.1.2     Source Sound Power  

The sound power level of equipment shall be based on the following in this order of preference:  

1) Data from the manufacturer, such as those based on IEC 61400-11 or IEC TS 61400-14 for wind turbines, or similar standards used for other equipment. For wind turbines, the maximum “apparent” sound power at any wind speed must be used. For other equipment, the maximum sound power of any applicable operational mode must be used. For example, for a solar project, the inverters would be assumed to be operating at full power and the substation transformer fans would be operating. For an energy storage facility, the higher of the charging or discharging sound emissions would be used. If an energy storage project is coupled with a solar project, then both daytime and nighttime scenarios should be modeled to assess the worst case.   
2) If manufacturer data is not available, then tests of the same or similar equipment can be used, or standards for the piece of equipment can be used, such as NEMA TR-1 which specifies the maximum sound emissions for liquid-immersed transformers.   
3) If sound power data are otherwise not available, the published sound power levels for similar equipment can be used. The applicant must demonstrate that the equipment proposed to be used is substantially similar.   
4) If none of these are available, the application must justify and explain the alternative method to determine sound power.  

Some manufacturers only provide a sound pressure level at a certain distance, rather than a sound power level. Care should be taken in converting this to a sound power level, especially with larger devices such as transformers and central inverters. Standards such as IEEE C57.12.90 or an applicable selection from the ISO 3740 series (such as ISO 3744 or ISO 3746) should be used to take into account the measurement area around the source.  

# D1.2      Sound Monitoring (Exhibit A-1.7)  

# D1.2.1     Purpose  

Preconstruction sound monitoring provides an understanding of potential noise impacts on the existing soundscape prior to development of an energy facility. The purpose of preconstruction sound monitoring is to determine the existing character of the area that  

is being considered for construction of an energy facility. The sound monitoring should generally follow the requirements of ANSI S12.18 and ANSI S12.9 Part 3, where applicable.  

# D1.2.2     Equipment  

Sound level meters shall meet the ANSI/IEC Class 1 performance requirements (i.e., IEC 61672-1 and ANSI S1.4 Part 1) and log 1/3 octave band equivalent sound pressure levels. The microphone shall be protected by a 7-inch diameter hydrophobic windscreen or equivalent. If possible, sound level meters should be coupled with audio recorders to aid in sound source identification and soundscape characterization.  

Each sound level meter shall be field calibrated with an acoustical calibrator meeting the requirements of IEC 60942 Class 1 immediately before and after each monitoring period. Any calibration drift above 0.5 dB will be noted and addressed with respect to ANSI S12.18. Each sound level meter and field calibrator shall have been calibrated within two years and one year, respectively, of the completion of monitoring by a National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable facility.  

Anemometers must be located adjacent to each monitoring station at microphone height to measure wind speed.  

# D1.2.3     Siting  

At least two sound monitors shall be sited representative of the nonparticipating residential receptors with the highest modeled sound levels from the future facility. Preconstruction monitoring locations should be analogous to and applicable for the postconstruction study. Projects covering larger areas with more than two soundscape types should monitor at additional locations.  

The monitor locations shall be outdoors and acoustically representative of a nearby residence. Specifically, monitoring equipment shall, to the extent practically possible, be placed at a similar distance from prominent soundscape sources such as roadways, heavy vegetation, and stationary equipment. The microphone shall either be façade mounted or in the free-field at least 25 feet from any building, and approximately $1.2\textrm{m}$ to $1.5\mathrm{~m~}$ above ground level.  

# D1.2.4     Data Collection and Analysis  

The target sound level metric and averaging time for assessment of noise compliance are the one-hour equivalent continuous level (L1h). Sound levels shall be logged at a finer interval than one-hour to provide the fidelity to enable source characterization through 1/3 octave band spectrograms and the calculation of statistical sound levels over the course of an hour, i.e. 10th percentile (L10), median (L50), and 90th percentile (L90) sound levels. To this end, 1/3 octave band data should be logged at least once per minute; a onesecond measurement interval is preferred.  

# D1.2.4.1   Data Exclusions  

To ensure an acoustically valid dataset, periods during which any of the following conditions occur shall be excluded from analysis:  

High wind gusts – Ground-level wind gust speeds above 5 m/s (11.2 mph). Precipitation – Snow, rain, and thunderstorm events identified through regional data and inspection of acoustic data.   
 Anomalies – The presence of short-term contaminating sound caused by human or other activity that is atypical of the site or directly attributable to the presence of the equipment.   
 Temperature or humidity outside the specification of the sound level meter or microphone.  

If more than half of a one-hour aggregation period was not acoustically valid, (due to high winds or precipitation, for example), the entire one-hour period should be excluded from the analysis.  

# D1.2.4.2   Biogenic Sound  

Biogenic sounds (particularly insects, birds, and amphibians) are typically tonal and can have a pronounced effect on overall A-weighted sound levels. If biogenic sounds are a dominant aspect of the soundscape during monitoring, their influence on overall sound level should be quantified.  

The “ANS” frequency-weighting (ANSI/ASA S12.100) should be applied to spectral sound levels to filter out high-frequency biogenic sound. ANS filters out sound above the $1\:\mathsf{k H z}$ octave band. Ideally, ANS weighting should only be used when tonal sounds, indicative of seasonal biogenic sound, are detected.  

When the effect of biogenic sound is significant, that is, the overall A-weighted sound level is at least 3 dB greater than the ANS-weighted sound level, then both A-weighted and ANS-weighted sound level results shall be reported.  

# D1.3      Monitoring and Modeling Documentation to submit (Exhibit A-1.7)  

A preconstruction noise assessment study shall include, but is not limited to, the following:  

1) Facility Description   
2) Maps and descriptions of sources and monitoring locations, including the distance from each to the nearest facility equipment.

5) Discussion – An assessment of the facility’s noise impacts and ability to meet the MCL 460.1226 noise limits, including a detailed description of all noise mitigation used or required to meet the noise limits.  

# D1.4      Postconstruction Sound Monitoring Protocol (Exhibit A-1.7)  

Postconstruction Sound Monitoring Protocol - A Protocol shall be developed by the applicant for conducting postconstruction sound monitoring. The sound monitoring should generally follow the requirements of Section 1.2 of this document. The Protocol shall include details on:

# D1.5      Other documentation  

Upon the request of Staff, sound modeling files and sound monitoring results shall be submitted in electronic format. Files with trade secrets or otherwise confidential information may be submitted under a confidential protective order.  

# D2.0    POSTCONSTRUCTION SOUND MONITORING  

# D2.1      Purpose  

Postconstruction sound monitoring of the facility will be conducted to assess whether sound levels from the as-built facility meet the noise limits defined in MCL 460.1226. Sound monitoring should generally follow the requirements of IEC TC 61400-11-2 (for wind projects) and ANSI S12.9 Part 3, as applicable. Postconstruction sound monitoring shall be conducted in the first year after the facility is constructed, unless otherwise directed by the commission.  

# D2.2      Monitoring Guidelines  

The noise limit for energy facilities, as defined in MCL 460.1226, is 55 dBA L1h refers specifically to facility-produced sound. To ensure that facility operation is assessed in a variety of conditions, including those associated with maximum sound emissions from the facility, unattended long-term monitoring (at least seven to 10 days) should be completed, or until sufficient valid periods are obtained, as defined in the Protocol, whichever is later. Other potential avenues for demonstrating noise compliance with MCL 460.1226 are provided in Section 2.3.  

# D2.2.1 Equipment  

Sound level meters shall meet the ANSI/IEC Class 1 performance requirements (i.e., IEC 61672-1 and ANSI S1.4) and log 1/3 octave band equivalent sound pressure levels. The microphone shall be protected by a 7-inch diameter or equivalent hydrophobic windscreen. Sound level meters should be coupled with audio recorders to aid in sound source identification and soundscape characterization. Audio recordings may be triggered by higher measured sound levels. If triggering is used, sound levels above 44 dBA should trigger recordings. Lower trigger levels may also be used.  

Each sound level meter shall be field calibrated with an acoustical calibrator meeting the requirements of IEC 60942 Class 1 immediately before and after each monitoring period. Any calibration drift above 0.5 dB will be noted and addressed with respect to ANSI S12.18. Each sound level meter and calibrator shall have been calibrated within two years/one year, respectively, of the completion of monitoring, by a National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable facility.  

Anemometers must be located adjacent to the monitoring station at microphone height to measure wind speed.  

Additional meteorological data can be obtained from nearby National Weather Service station and/or facility logging systems.  

# D2.2.2     Siting  

Monitors should be sited at representative locations for the two nonparticipating dwellings with the highest modeled sound level.  

Additional monitors for residences with formal noise complaints regarding facility operation should also have monitoring equipment deployed. Up to three additional sound monitoring locations will be identified for monitoring, representing areas where any noise complaints were received. If more than three locations received complaints, then three will be selected based on the modeled sound levels of each location and how well a site can represent other complaint locations.14 Consideration of whether monitoring will be done at a location will also be based on:  

The type of complaint (outdoor or indoor noise, tones, low frequency noise, amplitude modulation, vibrations, rumbles, rattles, etc., if available). Whether the complaint was due to a continuing operational issue or a nonrecurring event.  Whether the modeled free-field sound level is above 44 dBA (or dwelling wall is above 50 dBA).  Whether the landowner cooperates with the study.  

For facilities with centrally located equipment, like an energy storage facility or an isolated wind turbine, a “source” monitor, placed near the sound emitting equipment, can be utilized to correlate sound levels from the source.  

Sound level meter microphones shall be placed outside, approximately $1.2\textrm{m}$ to $1.5~\mathrm{m}$ above the ground. The microphone shall not be placed such that any structure blocks the line of sight between the microphone and otherwise visible facility components nor in such a way that it is representative of the noise exposure at the monitoring location. A location on the nearest vertical surface of the residence can be utilized or, more commonly, a location in the free-field at least 25 feet from any building façade or other large reflective objects. If a free-field location is chosen, then 6 dB must be added to the results to account for the pressure doubling at the wall of the dwelling.  

Monitoring equipment should not be placed within dense vegetation and should be away from other contributing sources of transient and consistent sound (e.g., heating systems, roadways, stationary farm equipment).  

If site access is denied by a landowner to measure near or on the dwelling, the sound monitor may be sited at the closest property line at the same or similar modeled sound isoline as the dwelling. If a location with a similar sound level cannot be obtained, then an additional sound level correction shall be extrapolated to the dwelling through use of sound propagation modeling.  

The one-hour equivalent average (L1h) is the target sound level metric and averaging time for assessment of noise compliance. Sound levels shall be logged at a finer interval than one-hour to provide the fidelity to enable source characterization through 1/3 octave band spectrograms and the calculation of statistical sound levels over the course of an hour, i.e. 10th percentile (L10), median (L50), and lower 10th percentile (L90) sound levels. To this end, 1/3 octave band data should be logged at least once per minute; a one-second measurement interval is preferred.  

Project operation logs (SCADA) and sound levels shall be collected to categorize operational states of the facility. If necessary, confidential facility operational data can be submitted to Staff under a confidential protective order.  

# D2.2.3     Data Processing and Analysis  

# D2.2.3.1   Data Exclusions  

To ensure an acoustically valid dataset, periods during which any of the following conditions occur shall be excluded from analysis:  

High wind gusts – ground-level wind gust speeds above $5\mathrm{m}/\mathsf{s}$ (11.2 mph).  Precipitation – snow, rain, and thunderstorm events identified through regional data and inspection of acoustic data.  

 Anomalies – The presence of short-term contaminating sound caused by human or other activity that is atypical of the site or directly attributable to the presence of the equipment.   
 Temperature or humidity outside the specification of the sound level meter or microphone.  

If more than half of a one-hour aggregation period was not acoustically valid, (due to high winds or precipitation, for example), the entire one-hour period should be excluded from the analysis (ANSI S12.9 Part 3).  

# D2.2.3.2   Biogenic Sound  

Sound level data containing notable biogenic sound should be treated carefully and noted in the narrative description of the monitoring site and results.  

Solar Energy and Energy Storage may contribute sound at frequencies above the 1 kHz octave band. Therefore, additional care should be taken when monitoring the sound of these facilities, including scheduling postconstruction monitoring during periods where insects and other biogenic sounds are less prominent, such as late fall through early spring.  

Wind Energy facility contribution of sound above the 1 kHz octave band (the sound spectrum of most biogenic sound) is typically negligible. Thus, sound monitoring for wind facilities may be conducted at any time. However, wind turbine power output, and thus sound output, tends to be highest in the late fall through early spring.  

# D2.2.3.3   Tonality  

A prominent discrete tone is assessed by comparing the total sound level in a given 1/3 octave band to the adjacent 1/3 octave bands for each minute. The difference between the 1/3 octave band sound level is compared to the arithmetic average of the sound levels in the adjacent 1/3 octave bands. If the difference is greater than the values listed below, a prominent discrete tone is present.  

 15 dB at low frequencies (1/3 octave band center frequencies ${}^{25\mathsf{H z}}$ to $125\mathsf{H z})$ .  8 dB at middle-frequency bands (1/3 octave band center frequencies 160 to 400 Hz).  

 5 dB at high-frequency bands (1/3 octave band center frequencies 500 to 10,000 Hz).  

Anyone-minute period with prominent discrete tones shall have a tonal penalty of 5 dB applied to the data if the tone is audible.  

# D2.3      Facility Sound Level Analysis  

# D2.3.1     General Procedures  

In general, sound levels attributable to the facility (“facility sound”) can be determined by an operational shutdown-based methodology. Facility sound shall be calculated from the total (facility $^+$ background) sound by quantifying the background sound immediately before or after a period of facility operation at the same location. The sound level attributed to facility operations shall be determined by subtracting, on an energy basis, the background sound level from the total sound level, by 1/3 octave band, consistent with ANSI S12.9 Part 3 Section 7.  

The results for any free field monitoring locations shall have 6 dB added to account for the pressure doubling that would have been measured had the measurement been taken at the outer wall of the dwelling.  

In some cases, long-term monitoring or facility shutdowns may not be practical due to operational characteristics or restrictions and alternatives to determine compliance with MI MCL 460.1226 are necessary.  

 Short-term monitoring under worst-case meteorological and operational conditions where total free field sound levels are below 44 dBA (55 dBA noise limit with 5 dB tonality and the 6 dB façade correction) for at least three one-hour periods. No tonal or background corrections are necessary, or   
 Measurements of individual sources to confirm manufacturer specifications and modeling inputs (e.g. 70 dBA at 1 meter or sound power using IEEE C57.12.90 or the applicable method in the ISO 3740 series), or   
 Other methods consistent with ASA/ANSI S12.9 Part 3.  

# D2.3.2     Special Procedures for Wind Energy  

To the extent possible, the assessment of wind turbine noise should conform to IEC TS 61400-11-2. The recommended application of the technical standard in Michigan includes practical simplifications to alleviate specialized equipment and high-fidelity SCADA data.  

# D2.3.2.1   Equipment, Siting, and Deployment  

Monitors for assessment of wind turbines should either be mounted directly on wall or be at least 25 feet from any vertical reflecting surfaces, if possible, to minimize reflections from a façade. If the wall mount is not used, a $^{+6}$ dB correction shall be applied to the resulting facility only sound levels.  

# D2.3.2.2   Determination of Facility Sound  

The method described herein applies the filtering method similar to that presented in IEC TS 61400-11-2. It includes scheduled nighttime wind turbine shutdowns to allow for the subtraction of background sound levels.  

Maximum wind turbine sound shall be assessed at night. During nighttime hours, background sound (particularly anthropogenic and avian activity) is typically lowest and meteorological conditions for robust propagation of sound are most common.  

All wind turbines within 1.5 miles of a monitor location shall be shut down four to eight times per night for 20 minutes at a time. One-hour periods of wind turbine operation before and after each shutdown shall be evaluated in 10-minute15 intervals.  

From logged data for each monitor, each 10-minute period is aggregated to determine the following:  

Overall A-weighted Leq.   
1/3 octave band Leq.   
Maximum wind gust near the ground.   
Average wind speed near the ground. Wind direction16.   
Hub-height wind speed17.   
Wind turbine power production18.   
Facility operational state (e.g., ON or OFF).  

To qualify as a potential measurement of the maximum facility sound, the hour adjacent to a shutdown shall have at least half of the 10-minute periods meeting the target evaluation criteria to be “valid”:  

 Data is acoustically valid (i.e. at least half not excluded for wind gusts, precipitation, anomalies). Wind turbines within 1.5 miles are operating at or within 1 dB of their maximum sound power output, expressed as an arithmetic average of those wind turbines.   
Average wind speed at microphone level is below $4\mathrm{m}/\mathsf{s}$ and one minute wind gusts are below $5\mathrm{m}/\mathsf{s}$ .   
 The wind direction is either $\pm45$ degrees downwind relative to the closest wind turbines or within $\pm45$ degrees of the prevailing wind direction.  

The total $\ L1\mathsf{h}$ is calculated from no less than three valid 10-minute periods in the hour. The background sound level temporally adjacent shall then be logarithmically subtracted, on a 1/3 octave band basis, from the L1h during operation, as described at the beginning of this section (ANSI S12.9 Part 3 Section 7) to determine the facility L1h.  

At least three valid facility L1h periods must be collected. The highest facility L1h shall be used for comparison to the MI MCL 450.1226 noise limit.  

# D2.3.2.3   Other Details  

Since the $\mathsf{L}_{\mathsf{e q}}$ is the metric of interest, ensuring that sound level data is free from anomalous and transient data during the target evaluation periods is critical to ensuring the accuracy of the study. Anomalous data shall be excluded from background and turbine operation periods.  

The temporal filtering method assumes that wind speeds do not substantively change in the 20 minutes the facility is shut down. This can be confirmed qualitatively by comparing the turbine power production prior to the shutdown to the power production afterward. Alternatively, ground wind speeds measured at each monitor can be evaluated. If they are sufficiently similar, the background period can be assumed to be representative of the background conditions during the adjacent one-hour turbine operational periods. Otherwise, the one-hour periods around the background measurement cannot be used to calculate the facility L1h.  

If substation noise from a wind project is the subject of a noise complaint, then the substation sound would be measured in accordance with the General Procedures of Section 2.3.  

# D2.4      Documentation to Submit  

A sound monitoring report shall be submitted within 60 calendar days of end of the field data collection.  

Sound monitoring reports must include a facility site map identifying relevant project components and nearby features of interest, including the nearest dwellings and monitor locations.  

For each monitoring location, the following information will be reported:  

1) Identification of monitoring locations with pictures and on a map.   
2) Narrative of monitoring results - soundscape characteristics and effects of site conditions on measurements as derived from site visits and monitored data, as well as any significant features of the data or the monitoring period, such as the presence of biogenic sound.  

3) Time history results  

a. Overall A-weighted hourly sound level time histories for $\mathsf{L}_{10\mathsf{m i n}}$ and L1h. The one-hour L90, L50, and L10 sound level metrics can also be included. b. Ground-level wind speed and rainfall.  

c. Facility operational data (power output and shutdown dates/times if used).  

4) Details for each compliance measurement period. For measurement methodologies that involve sound source shutdowns to establish the background sound levels, the compliance measurement period would be from one hour before the shutdown to one hour after the shutdown. Otherwise, the compliance measurement periods would consist of all valid periods under the protocol for each compliance measurement period, provide (in the report or in electronic format):  

a. 10-minute power output for individual sound sources.   
b. For wind facilities, hub height wind speed and wind direction for each wind turbine within 1.5 miles of the measurement location.   
c. Average wind speed and maximum wind gust from the monitor anemometer for each 10-minute period.   
d. Temperature and relative humidity (on site or from the nearest National Weather Service station).   
e. Unweighted 1/3 octave band and overall A-weighted sound levels for each 10-minute period.   
f. Determination of whether the period is valid and, if not, the reasoning.   
g. If the period is valid, the background-corrected facility 1/3 octave band and overall A-weighted sound level for each 10-minute period and for the entire one-hour period.  

5) For wind facilities, the presence of icing as indicated through icing alarms or visual observation.  

If results of the postconstruction study indicate that the facility sound levels exceed the noise limit, mitigation measures shall be detailed in the report along with a schedule of implementation.  

Upon implementation of mitigation measures, the sound measurements shall be repeated under similar conditions as the exceedance(s), with the updated results filed to the docket.  

# D2.5      Other Documentation

2.2.  State and Local Units of Government Requirements. The Applicant remains bound to obtain any permits or other authorizations required by the State or any local unit of government for purposes of decommissioning activities.  

# 3. Decommissioning Process.  

3.1. Initiation. Decommissioning of the Project shall commence under any of the following conditions (“Decommissioning Trigger Events”):  

3.1.1. Applicant-Initiated Decommissioning. The Developer may, subject to its agreements with the participating landowners and the terms of Commission approval, provide written notice to the parties of this Agreement, and the affected local unit’s chief elected official, of its intent to decommission the Project or a portion thereof.  

3.1.2. Landowner Agreements. The Applicant has entered into separate agreements with the owners of the land on which the Project will be developed.  To the extent these agreements require decommissioning within a stated period or upon specific events, decommissioning shall commence no later than upon the triggering of such terms to the extent not in conflict with the Commission Order. This decommissioning agreement is intended to be consistent with applicable landowner agreements to the extent not in conflict with the Commission Order.  

3.1.3. Depowering.  [ADJUST THIS TERM BASED ON RESOURCE TYPE] If the Project ceases to generate, store, or produce electricity for twelve (12) consecutive months, the project  shall be deemed depowered and decommissioning shall commence unless the Applicant can demonstrate that the lack of generation, storage, or production is the result of a reasonable and temporary condition for which there is an appropriate remedy approved through a Commission proceeding.  If a Project fails to generate, store, or produce electricity within 5 years of commencing construction, it shall be deemed depowered, and decommissioning shall commence unless the Applicant can demonstrate through a Commission proceeding that generation, storage, or production will proceed within a reasonable time and manner. If the Project begins to generate, store, or produce electricity in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement and the Commission order approving the Project certificate before a decommissioning activity commences, the depowering may be deemed reversed pursuant to a Commission proceeding.  

3.1.4. Failure of Financial Assurance. The Applicant must replace any expiring financial assurance instrument meeting the requirements of this Agreement and the Commission order approving the Project (including any Estimated Decommissioning Cost updates pursuant to Paragraph 4.2.3) no less than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration date of the financial assurance instrument.  If the Applicant fails to do so, then decommissioning shall commence; provided, that prior to commencing decommissioning for failure to replace the expiring financial assurance instrument, the Applicant shall have at least thirty (30) days to cure such failure.  If the Applicant’s financial assurance is to be revoked, terminated, or otherwise ceases to meet the requirements of the Act and Commission order approving the Project certificate, the Developer must immediately notify the parties to this Agreement.  If the Applicant cannot cure this inadequacy and bring the Project into conformance with the Act and Commission order approving the Project certificate within thirty (30) days, then decommissioning shall commence.  

3.1.5. Change of Ownership. If the ownership of the Project is transferred, the Applicant seeks to dissolve, or the ownership structure of the Developer is otherwise changed, the Developer must immediately file a demonstration in the MPSC docket assigned to the Project confirming the continued compliance with the Project certificate and the continued validity of the financial assurance.  If the Applicant fails to make any such demonstrations within 30 days of the underlying change, then decommissioning shall commence.  

3.1.6. Repowering.  If the Applicant attempts to repower the Project, as defined by MCL 460.1221(v), the Developer must seek a new certificate pursuant to MCL 460.1222.  If the Developer begins repowering but fails to seek a new certificate, then decommissioning shall commence unless the Developer halts all repowering activities and initiates the procedures for seeking local approval or a certificate to the satisfaction of the Commission within thirty (30) days of the start of repowering activities.  

3.2. Decommissioning Notice. Upon the occurrence of any of the above-specified Decommissioning Trigger Events, the Applicant shall immediately provide written notice to the parties to this agreement and the affected local units of government and file such notice in the MPSC docket assigned to the Project.

Commission-Initiated Decommissioning. If the Applicant, its successors or assigns, or any other person controlling the Project fails, refuses, or neglects to initiate decommissioning within 180 days of any of the Decommissioning Trigger Events, the Commission shall itself have the right, but not the obligation, to perform the Applicants decommissioning obligations under this Agreement, the Commission order approving the Project certificate, and the Commission-approved Decommissioning Plan. In such event, the Applicant (or its successors or assigns) agrees to give the Commission and its contractors or agents the right to possess, dispose of, and otherwise decommission the property that makes up the Project and shall defend, hold harmless, and indemnify the Commission for any and all claims, liability, loss, or damage arising out of its exercise of its right to decommission the Project as provided for herein, except in cases of negligence by the Commission or any of its contractors or agents.  The Commission shall not be required to expend funds beyond those funds provided through the financial assurances in order to perform the Applicant’s decommissioning obligations.  In the event the Applicant (or its successors or assigns) subsequently takes steps to initiate such activities and a decommissioning proceeding before the Commission within a reasonable time, the Commission may refrain from decommissioning activities and allow the Applicant (or its successors or assigns) to commence the necessary actions.  

3.4.2. Access Representations. The Applicant hereby represents that it has the rights of ingress, egress, access, and possession to the Project location pursuant to its agreements with Landowners and that the Commission’s rights under this Agreement are consistent with the terms of such agreements with the landowners.  The Commission shall provide reasonable notice to the Applicant and Landowner before entering the Project location if Commission-initiated decommissioning is warranted. The Applicant hereby represents it possesses the authority to grant such authority pursuant to its lease agreements and property rights.  

3.4.3. Future Obligations. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge and agree that appropriation of funds is a legislative function that the Commission cannot contractually commit itself to perform.
