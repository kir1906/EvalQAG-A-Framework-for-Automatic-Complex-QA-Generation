 ## Summary : 
 **_Note: The[Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)
](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf#page=993)created
the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/) with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

Ohio has conducted two rounds of NEVI funding so far, with awards for the
first round, for 23 locations, being announced in July 2023; the second round
awards, for 26 locations, were planned to be announced in May 2024 but are not
yet available on the program website. A Request for Proposals for a third
round of funding, for 15 locations, is expected in late Summer 2024. More
details on Ohio's NEVI process can be found in the [Ohio Electric Vehicle
Infrastructure Deployment
