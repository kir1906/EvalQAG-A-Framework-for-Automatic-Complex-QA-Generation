 ## Summary : 
 **_Note:[The Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA)](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf#page=993)
created the [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Grant
Program](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/) with a total budget of $5
billion. Each state was allocated a share of that total to help build out a
national network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated
alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). With some limited exceptions, EV charging
stations funded through the NEVI program should be spaced 50 miles apart and
within one mile of the Interstate exit or highway._**

The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) is the designated lead
agency for North Carolina's NEVI plan. It submitted North Carolina's initial
[NEVI Plan](https://www.ncdot.gov/initiatives-policies/environmental/climate-
change/Documents/ncdot-electric-vehicle-deployment-plan.pdf) to the federal
Joint Office of Energy and Transportation on August 1, 2022, and its [2023
Update](https://www.ncdot.gov/initiatives-policies/environmental/climate-
change/Documents/ncdot-electric-vehicle-deployment-plan.pdf) was submitted on
August 1, 2023. In Phase 1, North Carolina plans to build a network of about
37 charging stations along its designated AFCs. During Phase 2, it plans to
build community level charging infrastructure with a strong focus on
disadvantaged communities.

NCDOT released its [Phase 1 Request for
Proposals](https://www.ncdot.gov/initiatives-policies/environmental/climate-
change/NEVI/Pages/nevi-rfp-resources-applicants.aspx) (RFP) on April 8, 2024
and accepted applications through June 10, 2024. Awards will be posted in the
Fall of 2024. Round 2 RFPs will be released following Round 1 awards.
Interested parties can visit the NCDOT website to stay informed about future
funding rounds.
