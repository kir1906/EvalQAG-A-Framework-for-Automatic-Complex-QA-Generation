 ## Summary : 
 New Jersey's community solar program is governed by the [Solar Act of 2021 (L.
2021, c. 169) ](https://pub.njleg.gov/bills/2020/PL21/169_.HTM)which
established a new Successor Solar Incentive Program, also known as the “SuSI
Program”. The SuSI Program implements the Clean Energy Act of 2018 (L. 2018,
c.17) and the Solar Act of 2021 (L. 2021, c. 169). The SuSI Program provides
incentives to eligible solar facilities to enable the continued efficient and
orderly development of solar renewable energy generating sources throughout
the state.  

The program provides one New Jersey Solar Renewable Energy Certificate-II (NJ
SREC–II) for every megawatt-hour (MWh) of solar electricity produced by a
qualifying facility, with an additional $20/MWh adder for public entities –
such as school districts, municipalities, and public colleges and universities
– as well as a temporary incentive for projects built on contaminated lands.

A SuSI-eligible facility shall be eligible to generate NJ SREC-IIs for 15
years following the date of commencement of commercial operation.
