# Program Description  

Ride Clean Mass helps Uber, Lyft, and taxi drivers in Massachusetts switch to electric vehicles (EVs). We offer rebates up to $\$6,500$ on top of other state and federal incentives and provide support to make this transition easy. Our mission is to put more EVs on the road, reduce greenhouse gases, and improve air quality while supporting the drivers who need it most.  

Ride Clean Mass, funded by the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) and managed by CALSTART, helps drivers in Massachusetts get rebates for renting or purchasing EVs. We work with the Center for Sustainable Energy (CSE), Green Energy Consumers Alliance, and UMass Translation Center to make switching to EVs easier and cheaper. Our goal is to provide $\$5.35$ million in rebates and support the adoption of 800 to 2,100 EVs through 2025.  

# Rebate Amounts  

• New EVs: Get $\$6,500$ off the price of a new EV.   
• Used EVs: Get $\$2,500$ off the price of a used EV.   
• Renting EVs: $\$100$ per week for up to 4 weeks to help cover the cost of renting an EV. o Rental weeks must be consecutive, applicants must specify how many weeks they are requesting funding for in their application, and drivers are only eligible for 1 rental rebate each. Drivers who receive rental rebates are encouraged to purchase an EV and apply for a purchase rebate.  

# Program Timeline and Phases  

Ride Clean Mass will launch in November 2024 and remain open until all allocated funds $(\$5,354,065)$ are fully disbursed. We anticipate completing funding distribution within 2025.  

To help drivers explore electric vehicles, we will host two "Ride and Drive" events where participants can test drive EVs:  

• Event 1: November 12, 2024, at Suffolk Downs in the Boston area. Event 2: February 2025 (tentative) in Springfield, Massachusetts.  

The program will operate in two distinct phases to ensure simplicity and fairness:  

# Phase 1 (First-Come, First-Served):  

Beginning with the program's launch, funding will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. Applicants can check their eligibility through the Application Portal; however, funds will not be reserved at this stage until a post-purchase application is submitted and approved.  

# Phase 2 (Reserved Funding):  

After $90\%$ of the total funding is disbursed (subject to adjustment), the program will enter Phase 2. At this point, applicants who pass the eligibility check will have funds automatically reserved for 60 days. If the applicant does not complete the purchase of an EV and submit their rebate application within this period, the funds will return to the general pool.  

Applicants approved after all remaining funds have been reserved will be placed on a waitlist and notified if additional funding becomes available.  

# Eligibility  

To qualify for Ride Clean Mass rebates, applicants must meet the following general requirements, along with additional criteria specific to Uber, Lyft, and taxi drivers.  

# General Eligibility (All Applicants)  

1. Vehicle Purchase Date: The vehicle must be purchased on or after November 12,   
2024.   
2. Vehicle Eligibility: The vehicle must be listed on the approved vehicle list maintained by the MOR-EV program (see eligible vehicles) and have a total MSRP (manufacturer suggested retail price) below $\$55,000$ as required in the MOR-EV program. This requirement is described in more detail below under “MOR-EV Vehicle Eligibility Requirements” within the Terms & Conditions. Lastly, vehicles may be purchased out of state as long as they are registered in Massachusetts. Rentals must be made in Massachusetts.   
3. Massachusetts Residency: Applicants must hold a valid Massachusetts Driver’s License or provide proof of Massachusetts residency.  

4. Insurance: Applicants must have valid driver’s insurance in Massachusetts. Insurance must be with carriers that are admitted and authorized in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Self-insurance does not meet this eligibility requirement.  

5. Terms & Conditions: Applicants must agree to the program's Terms & Conditions, which are listed at the bottom of this document.  

6. Number of Rebates: Applicants are only eligible for 1 application, with a few exceptions. Among these exceptions are (1) rental rebates, where applicants are eligible to receive a rental rebate first and then they may purchase an EV and apply for a purchase rebate. Applicants may not purchase an EV, receive a purchase rebate, and then apply for a rental rebate. (2) Taxi fleet owners may apply for multiple purchase incentives.  

# Uber & Lyft Drivers  

1. Rides / Miles Eligibility. Drivers must have:  

a. Completed 300 rides or 1,500 miles in any two of the previous four quarters  

2. Qualifying Rides / Miles:  

a. Only rides with passengers count towards the rides/miles eligibility, deliveries do not   
b. Only rides beginning in Massachusetts qualify   
c. Only miles accrued during a trip qualify, miles driven between rides do not.  

CSE will coordinate with Uber and Lyft to determine if applicants meet the rides and miles eligibility criteria. Only trips transporting passengers, not packages, count towards the rides/miles eligibility requirements.  

# Taxi Drivers  

1. Taxi Credentials. Taxi drivers or owners must either: a. Own or lease a taxi medallion, or b. Hold a current taxi license/permit.  

# Application Process  

The Ride Clean Mass Application Portal includes two key steps: Check Your Eligibility and Apply for a Rebate. Both steps are impacted by the program’s two phases.  

# Check Your Eligibility  

The Check Your Eligibility section allows applicants to determine whether they qualify for a rebate before purchasing or renting a vehicle by answering a few simple questions:  

• Do you have a Massachusetts Driver's License or proof of residency in Massachusetts?   
? Is your vehicle on the approved vehicle list maintained by the MOR-EV program?   
• Was the vehicle purchased on or after November 12, 2024? For Uber/Lyft drivers: Applicants must meet the rides and miles eligibility requirements (400 rides or 1,800 miles in the last quarter and in 3 of the last 4 quarters). CSE will coordinate with Uber and/or Lyft to validate rides and miles eligibility for applicants.   
• For taxi drivers: Can you provide proof of a taxi medallion or current taxi license/permit?   
• Do you agree to the program’s Terms & Conditions, including authorizing Uber or Lyft to share data with the Center for Sustainable Energy to verify your rides/miles eligibility?  

The eligibility check is designed to give drivers confidence in their eligibility before purchasing a vehicle. However, Ride Clean Mass reserves the right to deny rebates if applicants provide incorrect or misleading information during this step.  

Applicants will be notified via email about their eligibility within 3 weeks of submitting their eligibility check.  

During Phase 1 only, checking eligibility alone does not reserve funding—funds are only guaranteed after a rebate application has been approved.  

# Apply for a Rebate  

The Apply for a Rebate section is where applicants officially submit their rebate request after purchasing or renting their vehicle. This application requires more detailed information and supporting documents, such as their Driver’s License and proof of purchase. Applicants will be notified via email about any status changes to their application. Applicants whose status is updated to “Approved” will receive a check in the mail within 3 weeks of being notified. If more than 3 weeks have passed, please contact info@ridecleanmass.org or call us at 339-707-7356.  

# Phase 1 vs Phase 2  

The program will begin with Phase 1, offering funding on a first-come, first-served basis. Applicants may begin with Check Your Eligibility step or directly begin with Apply For A Rebate. As funding is spent down to around $10\%$ remaining (subject to adjustment), the program will shift to Phase 2 to provide greater assurance of funding availability to applicants.  

In Phase 2, applicants must complete the Check Your Eligibility step. Applicants that are notified as eligible will have funds reserved for 60 days, ensuring that they receive a rebate if they complete their EV purchase and rebate application within this window. If they do not apply for the rebate within 60 days, the funds will return to the general pool. Once all funding is reserved, new applicants will be placed on a waitlist and notified if funds become available.  

To ensure a smooth transition:  

1. The Project Team will work with Uber and Lyft to notify drivers about the change.   
2. CALSTART and Green Energy Consumers Alliance will inform potential applicants.   
3. CALSTART will maintain an up-to-date ticker on the website, showing how much funding remains and the rate at which it is being requested.  

This phased approach balances simplicity with fairness—Phase 1 offers quick access to funds, while Phase 2 provides security to applicants as funding runs low, ensuring that eligible applicants can plan their purchases with confidence.  

# Appeals Process  

If your application for the Ride Clean Mass rebate program is rejected, you will receive an email detailing the specific reason(s) for the decision. If you believe your application was incorrectly assessed, you may appeal the decision by submitting a response via email to info@ridecleanmass.org clearly explaining why you believe the Ride Clean Mass team was mistaken in their assessment and addressing the specific reason for the rejection.  

Upon receiving your appeal, the Ride Clean Mass team will conduct a thorough review and respond promptly. Please note, however, that as outlined in the Terms and Conditions, the Ride Clean Mass team reserves the right to make final determinations regarding  

application eligibility and cannot be held liable for rejections based on unmet eligibility requirements.  

# Terms & Conditions  

# Data Sharing and Privacy Consent  

By submitting an application, the applicant expressly consents to the Center for Sustainable Energy (CSE) obtaining and accessing data from the applicable Transportation Network Company (TNC) (e.g., Uber or Lyft) regarding the number of miles driven and rides provided by the applicant over the past four (4) quarters, along with the sharing of personal identifying information that includes the applicant’s name, email address, phone number and driver’s license number. This data will be utilized solely for the purposes of program administration and eligibility verification under the Ride Clean Mass initiative.  

Applicants further consent to the applicable Transportation Network Company (TNC) (e.g., Uber or Lyft) sharing data with the Center for Sustainable Energy (CSE) related to the number of miles driven and rides completed using the applicant’s electric vehicle for a period of twelve (12) months following the vehicle purchase. This data, including vehicle information such as VIN, make, model, and year, will be used solely for program administration and eligibility verification under the Ride Clean Mass initiative, specifically to gauge the emissions benefits of the program. All applicant personal data and nonaggregated trip data collected will remain confidential and accessible only to CSE and the TNC with which the applicant is affiliated, and will not be shared with any third parties without prior written consent, except as required by state or federal law. Any research or analysis data made available externally will rely solely on aggregated and anonymized information to protect applicant privacy. All collected data will be kept secure in accordance with industry standards.  

# Pre-Approval and Reapplication Process  

Pre-approval for participation in the Ride Clean Mass program does not constitute a guarantee of funding. All pre-approved applicants are required to submit an “Apply for a Rebate” application upon the purchase of an electric vehicle. If, upon review of the “Apply for a Rebate” application, any information provided during the pre-approval process is found to be incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading, the applicant’s eligibility for a rebate may be denied at the sole discretion of the Ride Clean Mass team.  

# Limitation of Liability  

The Ride Clean Mass team, including but not limited to the Massachusetts Clean Energy Technology Center (MassCEC) , CALSTART, the Center for Sustainable Energy (CSE), Green  

Energy Consumers, and the UMass Translation Center, as well as the applicable TNC(s), shall not be held liable for any decision to reject a rebate application on the basis that it does not meet the program's eligibility requirements. Additionally, the Ride Clean Mass team is not a party to any transaction between the applicant (driver) and the dealership or store from which an electric vehicle is purchased. Accordingly, the Ride Clean Mass team bears no responsibility for any disputes, issues, or liabilities arising from such transactions. No employment relationship, joint venture, or principal and agent relationship will be created between the applicant, Uber, Lyft, and any member of the Ride Clean Mass team solely by virtue of the applicant’s participation in the Ride Clean Mass program.  

By submitting an application, the applicant agrees to hold harmless and release the aforementioned entities from any claims, liabilities, or damages arising from the rejection of their application or from the purchase of a vehicle.  

# MOR-EV Vehicle Eligibility Requirements  

In order to qualify for an incentive through the Ride Clean Mass program, the vehicle purchased by the applicant must be a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) or a Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) listed as eligible on the Massachusetts Offers Rebates for Electric Vehicles (MOR-EV) program website. The full list of eligible vehicles is maintained on the MOR-EV website at https://mor-ev.org/eligible-vehicles. The vehicle must also have a Total MSRP1 under $\$55,000$ at the time of purchase if new, or a Purchase Price2  under $\$40,000$ if used.  

Furthermore, applicants must not make or allow any modifications to the vehicle’s emissions control systems, hardware, or software calibrations that may alter or interfere with the vehicle's environmental performance. Non-compliance with these terms may result in disqualification from the program and potential forfeiture of the incentive at the sole discretion of CALSTART.  

# Ownership and Driving Requirements  

Applicants must retain ownership of the vehicle for a minimum of thirty-six (36)  

consecutive months from the vehicle purchase date. The resale of a MOR-EV vehicle for financial gain within this 36-month period is strictly prohibited. If the vehicle is sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of before the 36-month period, the applicant may be required to return the incentive, in full or in part, at the sole discretion of CALSTART.  

Additionally, TNC incentive recipients must continue driving with a TNC for a minimum of twelve (12) consecutive months following the purchase of the electric vehicle purchased through the Ride Clean Mass program. Failure to meet this driving requirement may result in the revocation of the incentive, and the applicant may be required to return the incentive, in full or in part, at the sole discretion of CALSTART. If the applicant experiences unforeseen or unavoidable circumstances preventing them from meeting the driving requirements, the applicant may submit a written request explaining the circumstances along with any official corresponding documentation. CALSTART will review the exemption request with MassCEC to determine if the requirements for an exemption have been met.  

Furthermore, the vehicle purchased through the Ride Clean Program must maintain registration with the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) for a minimum of thirty-six (36) consecutive months for use within the state of Massachusetts. The vehicle must be actively used within the state of Massachusetts for these thirty-six (36) months to meet this requirement. Failure to meet this registration requirement may result in the revocation of the incentive, and the applicant may be required to return the incentive, in full or in part, at the sole discretion of CALSTART.
