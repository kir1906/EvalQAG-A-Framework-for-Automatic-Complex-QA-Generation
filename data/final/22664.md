# DEFINITION LIST  

For further guidance on any technical definitions, Applicants should reference 23 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 680.  

ADA Accessible Electric Vehicle Charging Stations: The American with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and implementing regulations, apply to electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. EV charging stations must comply with applicable accessibility standards adopted by the US Department of Transportation into its ADA regulations (49 CFR part 37). The US Access Board published “Design Recommendations for Accessible Electric Vehicle Charging Stations” in 2022. Until any formal rules are proposed and finalized, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) is requiring that at least one pedestal be designed and constructed according to US Access Board Recommendations to demonstrate ADA compliance and optimize usability for persons with disabilities. See recommendations at https://www.access-board.gov/ta/tad/ev/#other-considerations  

Alternative Fuel Corridors: A portion of the US Highway System designated as an EV charging corridor by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) pursuant to 23 United States Code (U.S.C.) 151. See: Alternative Fuel Corridors – FHWA  

Applicant Cost Share: A non-federal funding source that the Applicant must commit to the project as its share of the overall eligible project costs. For the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, the Applicant cost share is at least 20 percent, but Applicants can propose a higher cost share in their Cost Proposal.  

Charging Station: The area in the immediate vicinity of a group of chargers, including the chargers, supporting equipment, parking areas adjacent to the chargers, and lanes for vehicle ingress and egress. A charging station could comprise only part of the property on which it is located.  

Clusters: NCDOT term referring to the range of exits/crossroads along the alternative fuel corridor where an Applicant can propose to construct a NEVI-compliant charging station site. NCDOT will fund the construction of one charging station site within each cluster.  

Conditional Award: A conditional award is an agreement between two parties that an offer will be made if specific conditions are met. In this case, conditions may include National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) clearance and any other condition needed to successfully execute an EV charging site.  

Disadvantaged Community: Disadvantaged communities (DAC) are census tracts or communities with common conditions. The US Department of Transportation and the US Department of Energy consider appropriate data, indices, and screening tools to determine whether a specific community is disadvantaged based on a combination of variables that may include, but are not limited to, the following: low income, high and/or persistent poverty; high unemployment and underemployment; racial and ethnic residential segregation, particularly where the segregation stems from discrimination by government entities; linguistic isolation; high housing cost burden and substandard housing; distressed neighborhoods; high transportation cost burden and/or low transportation access; disproportionate environmental stressor burden and high cumulative impacts; limited water and sanitation access and affordability; disproportionate impacts from climate change; high energy cost burden and low energy access; jobs lost through the energy transition; and limited access to healthcare.  

See NCDOT NEVI Round 1 Clusters for a map containing a layer identifying these communities. See federal tools to identify DACs and key information at Equity and Justice40 Analysis Tools | US Department of Transportation and USDOT Equitable Transportation Community (ETC) Explorer (arcgis.com)  

Direct Current Fast Charging: Direct current fast charging (DCFC) is a type of EV charging station that uses direct current and can charge a typical light-duty battery electric vehicle to 80 percent capacity in 20 minutes to an hour.  

Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment: Electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) is a device that transfers and controls the power supply between site electricity infrastructure and an electric vehicle.  

Justice40: Executive Order 14008 created the Justice40 (J40) Initiative, which established a goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities. See Justice40 Initiative | US Department of Transportation for more details.  

Rural Areas: Rural is defined by the US Census Bureau as anything not classified as urban. See the US Census Bureau for more on this definition: 2020 Census Urban-Rural Classification Fact Sheet. North Carolina’s urban areas were defined by the 2020 US Census and published by the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management (OSBM) at the following link: 2020 Urban Areas — NC OSBM. For a shapefile to download and use with GIS, please see the US Census Burau at Urban and Rural (census.gov)  

Project site: Location where one or more charging stations are located. A project site may contain both a NEVI charging station and a non-NEVI charging station.  

Site Host: The owner or owners of the site who can legally enter into agreement(s) with utility provider(s) and charging station operator(s) and/or EV charging site Awardee(s).  

# 1 OVERVIEW  

# 1.1 Background  

Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), on November 15, 2021, which included the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. The NEVI Formula Program provides dedicated funding to construct electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) across the state, establishing a charging station network.  

North Carolina will receive approximately $\$109$ million in total over federal fiscal years (FFY) 2022– 2026. At this time, federal funding is available for FFY22, FFY23, and FFY24, totaling $\$62,580,572$ . The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) is the designated administrator of the funds for the state. These funds require a minimum 20 percent non-federal match and are provided to the selected sites on a reimbursement basis.  

# 1.2 Introduction  

NCDOT is seeking Applicants for this Request for Proposal (RFP) to participate in the deployment of direct current fast charging (DCFC) infrastructure across the state that complies with NEVI Formula Program requirements. The RFP published under this competitive selection provides available funding for updates to existing EVSE and new charging sites.  

Both existing and new stations must be sited along designated federal Alternative Fuel Corridors (AFC). NCDOT has identified specific segments of the AFCs as being optimal locations for EVSE that meet the program requirements. These are identified in Section 4.2 of this RFP. This RFP releases Round 1 of the funding for 11 of the 39 sites identified by NCDOT in its 2023 update to the North Carolina Electric Vehicle Implementation Deployment Plan (EVIDP).  

NCDOT’s goal is to fund EVSE deployment to strategically support the development of convenient, accessible, reliable, and equitable EVSE infrastructure along the designated clusters. The NEVI Formula Program also seeks to grow a local, diverse workforce for installing and repairing the charging infrastructure. All federally funded projects seek to meet the Justice-40 (J40) criteria.  

Disadvantage Business Enterprise (DBE) requirements do not apply to NEVI Formula Program funds. The award of sites and the execution of agreements will not be subject to DBE goals. Further guidance is contained in the NEVI Formula Program Guidance, and the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Standards and Requirements, Final Rule, Code of Federal Regulations Section 23, Part 680 (23 CFR 680). However, NCDOT encourages the involvement of federally designated disadvantaged communities in the project to help the state meet its J40 and workforce development goals.  

This RFP focuses on design, construction, acquisition, installation, operations, maintenance, data reporting, and ownership of EVSE infrastructure at locations near the interstate system where there is a lack of EVSE sites. NCDOT is providing reimbursement funds to eligible Applicants as defined in section 3.1 of this RFP. NCDOT will not own or operate any of the EVSE. The EVSE infrastructure and project sites will not be located within state-owned right-of-way.  

This RFP includes requirements for DCFC equipment, site selection, design, installation, operations and maintenance (O&M), and reporting. In addition, the RFP includes information on the process by which competitive selections will be awarded, funding match levels and requirements, project eligibility, funding priorities, activities eligible for reimbursement, and other information that will help Applicants plan their project and submit an application.

# 6 EVALUATION OF APPLICATIONS  

# 6.1 Evaluation Process  

NCDOT will use the following process to evaluate applications:  

# 6.1.1 Step 1: Responsiveness Check  

All applications will be reviewed for responsiveness (responsiveness check) to confirm the application meets the RFP requirements. The responsiveness check can be found in Attachment 3, Technical Application Form, and is a two-step, pass/fail assessment. The first step is an administrative responsiveness check. Applications that fail the administrative responsiveness check will be determined to be non-responsive and may not be evaluated further. If an Applicant or application fails to meet one or more of the requirements detailed in Attachment 3, it may be determined to be non-responsive.  

The second step is a technical responsiveness check. Applications must meet minimum NEVI requirements per 23 CFR 680. This includes, but is not limited to, the requirements outlined in Attachment 3, Technical Application Form. Applications that fail the technical responsiveness check will be determined to be non-responsive and may not be evaluated further. If an Applicant or application fails to meet one or more of the requirements detailed in Attachment 3, Technical Application Form, it may be determined to be non-responsive.  

# 6.1.2 Step 2: Technical Application Scoring Criteria and Evaluation  

For the purpose of evaluating technical applications, NCDOT will establish a review committee made up of no less than three members. Applications that pass the responsiveness check will be evaluated individually and scored by each review committee member on a competitive basis according to the scoring criteria and point maximums provided in the table below.

The technical score will be calculated by averaging the total scores from each review committee member. NCDOT reserves the right to hold consensus meetings as part of the evaluation process.  

# 6.1.3 Step 3: Cost Proposal Evaluation  

The cost score for each cost proposal will be calculated according to the formula detailed below.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>SCORINGCRITERIA-COSTPROPOSAL</td><td>MAXIMUM POINTS POSSIBLE</td></tr><tr><td>CostProposal</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>The Cost Proposal will be evaluated per cluster based on the Applicant's Maximum Total Project Reimbursement, as calculated and defined in Attachment 4, Cost Proposal.

# 6.1.4 Step 4: Score Tabulation  

The final score for each responsive application will be calculated by adding the technical score to the cost score. The maximum final score for any application is 200 points. The review committee will finalize all award recommendations. The review committee will provide a recommendation to the NEVI Steering Committee, comprised of three or five NCDOT representatives. The NEVI Steering Committee will finalize all award decisions.  

NCDOT has final decision-making authority to award a project agreement to the selected Applicants.  

# 6.1.5 Step 5: Award  

NCDOT may select Applicants to receive a conditional award for a responsive application that has been recommended by the review committee and approved by the NEVI Steering Committee. NCDOT will notify selected Applicants of their award and will post the intent to award on the NCDOT NEVI website.  

NCDOT reserves the right to not award to any of the 11 sites during this time. Note that NCDOT will first conditionally award applications meeting the requirements and providing the best value. The award is conditional until NEPA clearance has been achieved and all required items have been submitted and approved by NCDOT.  

# 6.2 Application Irregularities and Clarifications  

NCDOT has the authority to reject any or all applications and to waive or allow corrections of any minor irregularity or non-material omission. NCDOT can request clarifications from Applicants, and the answers must be provided in the format detailed and deadline provided by NCDOT. Applicant’s answers and clarifications will become part of the application.  

# 7 POST-AWARD  

# 7.1 NEPA Clearance Prior to Execution of Agreement  

After NCDOT has issued a conditional award through the notice of intent to award, NCDOT will conduct the NEPA review for each conditionally awarded site. The conditional Awardee must provide support to NCDOT through the NEPA approval process. Any site that is unable to achieve NEPA clearance through a Categorical Exclusion may have their conditional award rescinded by NCDOT. NCDOT may issue a conditional award to the second highest application for that cluster and conduct the NEPA review. All sites that are issued conditional awards must receive NEPA clearance prior to executing the project agreement.  

# 7.2 Execution of Agreement  

The Applicant shall sign the project agreement within 45 calendar days of achieving NEPA clearance and receipt of the project agreement. At the time of execution of the project agreement, the Applicant shall provide the following documents.  

# 7.2.1 Signed Site Host Agreement between Applicant and Site Host Business Owner  

The site host agreement shall be between the Applicant and the business entity that holds the proper authority to enter into an agreement to construct and operate an EV charging station on the site referenced in the award. The site host agreement shall include the following items:  

• The site host agreement shall include proof of ownership of the site.   
• If the site is controlled via a long-term lease, the lessee must also provide a letter from the site owner, as well as a copy of the lease highlighting the section of the lease that gives the lessee the right to agree to the terms of the site host agreement. The site host agreement shall have an effective date no sooner than the date of execution of the agreement between NCDOT and the Applicant. The site host agreement must include the details outlined in Section 5.2.3. The site host agreement must address what occurs if either party becomes in default with either the site host agreement or the project agreement the Awardee has with NCDOT.   
• The site host agreement shall include the NEPA clearance provided by NCDOT.  

# 7.2.2 Signed Letter from the Utility  

The signed letter from the utility shall confirm that the utility will provide electrical service to the Applicant at the proposed site.  

# 7.2.3 Letter of Credit  

A sample Letter of Credit will be provided with the Notice of Conditional Award.  The Applicant shall provide a Letter of Credit which shall include similar language to the sample provided, and shall have an effective date no sooner than the date of execution of the project agreement. The Letter of Credit shall be provided for an amount equal to 60 percent of the Maximum Total Project Reimbursement. After each successful year of O&M, the total amount of the Letter of Credit can be reduced by 20 percent of the original amount following notification from NCDOT. The Letter of Credit will be drawn upon in the event of default by the Applicant.  

# 7.2.4 Proof of Registration to do Business in North Carolina  

All Applicants shall provide proof of registration to do business in North Carolina and cannot be debarred.  

# 7.2.5 Any Additional Documentation  

pplicant shall provide any additional certificates or documents deemed necessary by NCDOT.  

Note: The Applicant cannot incur or agree to the payment of any costs to be requested for reimbursement prior to the execution of the project agreement.  

Once the Applicant has provided the required documents outlined above, the project will be considered funded and has commenced. NCDOT may rescind the award if the Applicant does not sign the project agreement and provide the required documents in a timely manner.  

# 7.3 Reimbursement Mechanism  

Awardees will be eligible to submit invoices for reimbursement in accordance with the following:  

Capital Construction Payment: Cost reimbursement may be claimed upon full compliance with and completion of Tasks 1, 2, 3, and 5 as detailed in Attachment 2, Scope of Work. Supporting documentation of actual costs incurred is required, including invoices and proof of payment for reimbursement of costs already paid by the Awardee.  

o Capital Construction Payment Withholding: NCDOT will withhold 25 percent of the total capital maximum reimbursement amount claimed. Of this withholding, 20 percent will be released on an annual basis at the time of annual O&M payments, if all performance requirements and obligations of the project agreement are met.  

Annual O&M Payment: Cost reimbursement may be claimed for annual O&M costs upon annual compliance with and completion of Tasks 4 and 5, as detailed in Attachment 2, Scope of Work. Supporting documentation of actual costs incurred is required.  

Final Payment: Cost reimbursement may be claimed for the final year of O&M costs and all remaining withholding upon annual compliance with and completion of Tasks 4, 5, and 6, as detailed in Attachment 2, Scope of Work. Supporting documentation of actual costs incurred is required.  

NCDOT will only pay up to the maximum total project reimbursement detailed in the Cost Proposal Form during the application process for eligible costs (See Section 4.3) and all costs will be finalized in the final project agreement.  

# 7.4 Pay for Performance  

Additionally, a pay-for-performance approach shall be incorporated into the payment mechanism, incentivizing optimal performance of the charging stations, specifically meeting the 97 percent or greater uptime requirement, per port as required by 23 CFR 680.116.  

During the O&M period, the following deductions will occur from the annual O&M payment when claims for reimbursement are submitted: o For every percentage point, or fraction thereof, that the 97 percent uptime is not met on a per-port basis, $\$1,000$ will be deducted from that year’s O&M payment. o If there is no remaining O&M payment for the deduction to be subtracted from, the amount will be deducted from the remaining withholding. o Once deducted, the funds can never be reclaimed.  

# 7.5 Reasonable Return on Investment  

Per question 6.4 in the NEVI Formula Program Q&A and 23 CFR 680.106(m)2ii, the Awardee is not allowed to make more than a Reasonable Return on Investment on the charging station (project). This applies only to income received from EV charging. Reasonable Return on Investment on the charging station is determined by the State as no more than 25 percent annual profit on the project.  

The profit is calculated once at the end of the project and does not extend beyond the life of the project agreement. Profit is defined as the remainder of all revenue received from the operation of the EV charging and reimbursements from NCDOT (Total Revenue) after all eligible expenses, including reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses, have been deducted.  

Revenue: Revenue received from the operation of the project and reimbursements over the life of the project agreement.  

Eligible Expense: Includes all reimbursed and non-reimbursed eligible expenses the Awardee has incurred over the life of the project agreement. This includes the Applicant Cost Share.  

Any profit over 25 percent must be returned to NCDOT. This is capped at the Total Reimbursement amount. The Awardee shall provide a signed letter with the final invoice stating the amount of profit earned. NCDOT may ask for the Awardee to provide documentation as to the amount of profit earned.  

In the example below, the Awardee receives $\$45$ in revenue from EV Charging Operations. The total eligible expenses for the Project equals $\$100$ . This includes both reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses. The Awardee is reimbursed $80\%$ of their total eligible expenses, equaling $\$80$ . In this example, the Applicant Cost Share is $\$20$ .  In addition to making back their Applicant Cost Share of $\$20$ , the Awardee is able to make an additional $\$25$ in profit, more than doubling their at-risk investment (Applicant Cost Share).
