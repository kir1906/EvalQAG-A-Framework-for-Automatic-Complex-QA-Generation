 ## Summary : 
 Austin Energy provides rebates for the installation of public charging
stations at commercial workplaces. There are two rebate options, either
independent charging stations or Plug-in Austin Charging Stations.  

**Independent Stations**  

Independent stations are responsible for energy pricing and can choose to run
their stations on their own or partner with other 3rd party networks. For this
option, station owners pay for all 3rd party network fees incurred.
Independent station owners can also elect to install non-communicating
station(s) and/or set no energy pricing. There is a higher rebate incentive
for OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol) compliant stations.  

**Plug-in Austin Charging Stations**

Station hosts joining the Plug-in Austin network agree to let Austin Energy
set station pricing. For this option, Austin Energy also pays for network
renewal fees. Commercial Austin Energy account holders or their authorized
representative are eligible for Plug-In Austin EV Charging Station Rebates if
they install a ChargePoint network compatible station and join the Plug-In
Austin network. The Plug-In Austin network allows subscribed drivers to charge
unlimited for $4.17 per month at Level 2 stations (2023).
