Electric Vehicles (EVs) are growing in popularity because of their environmental and economicbenefits.  

Powered by electricity stored in rechargeable batteries, EVs do not produce the emissions that gas-powered vehicles produce making them better for the environment. Economically, $\mathsf{E V}$ owners are projected to save 30 to 60 percent in gasoline costs plus spend less on maintenance and repairs fees over the vehicle's lifetime because EVs have fewer internal components. No more oil changes! EVs also are efficient because they can turn electricity into movement quickly and use less energy during the process.  

The cost savings, along with federal government tax credits, buy-in from car manufacturers, new battery technologies and more public charging infrastructure are accelerating the historic transition to EVs.  

# To further support the transition and make EV ownership more accessible and rewarding, Cleco is offering a $\$250$ Level 2 EV Charger incentive to residential customers. This incentive covers approximately 50 percent of the equipment cost. Click here to apply and view terms and conditions.  

With the rising and fluctuating costs of traditional gasoline, EVs provide a cost-effective alternative. Take advantage of the fuel savings, tax credits and financial incentives available when you purchase an EV while driving toward a greener, cleaner future.
