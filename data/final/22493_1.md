(k)  Pursuant to RSA 362-F:15, II(b), certificates for periods after March 31, 2017 produced by previously-certified class III sources determined to be ineligible because they have a total aggregate gross nameplate capacity in excess of 10 megawatts located at a single landfill site, including all phases, stages, cells, lifts, expansions, and other landfill areas, shall not be used for portfolio standards compliance.  

(l)  Notwithstanding (k) above, any such Class III certificates purchased pursuant to a contract entered into prior to July 11, 2017 shall be eligible for portfolio standards compliance for the term of such contract, and provided that the term of the contract has not been extended or otherwise increased after that date.  

(m)  Providers of electricity shall inform the commission by July 1, 2018 and by July 1 of each year thereafter through July 1, 2020, of all contracts referenced in (j) and (l) above.  Such information shall include the execution date and expiration date of the contract, the basis for exemption under (j) or (l) above, and, in the case of contracts referenced in (j) above, the annual megawatt-hours supplied and exempted, and, in the case of contracts referenced in (l) above, the annual amount of exempted Class III methane gas certificates and the basis for exemption.

Puc 2506.09  Calculation of Certificates for Production of Biodiesel.  

(a)  When calculating the certificates to be issued to a biodiesel producer, the independent monitor shall use the following assumptions and calculations to determine an end-user efficiency rating (ER):  

(1)  An ER of $81\%$ shall be used to calculate energy production from all biodiesel sales volumes, with the exception of direct sales by the producer to large biodiesel end users; and  

(2)  The actual thermal efficiency rating $(\mathrm{E_{T}})$ of the end user’s system shall be used for all volumes of biodiesel sold by the producer directly to any large biodiesel end user, as provided by the producer to the independent monitor.  

(b)  The independent monitor shall use the following method to calculate the quantity of certificates for which a biodiesel producer is eligible:  

(1)  ER shall be as specified in (a) above;  

(2)  “Total verified sales (TVS)” means the total volume in gallons of sales to New Hampshire thermal end users that is verified through supporting records and documentation submitted to the independent monitor, excluding volumes sold directly to any large biodiesel end user participating in the thermal REC program;  

(3)  Thermal energy production (TEP) shall be calculated as:  

$$
\mathrm{TEP}=\mathrm{Btu}/\mathrm{gallon}\mathrm{xTVS}\mathrm{xER},
$$  

where one gallon of biodiesel contains 127,000 Btus, per the U.S. Department of Energy Biodiesel Handling and Use Guide, Fifth Edition, November 2016, available at http://biodiesel.org/docs/using-hotline/nrel-handling-and-use.pdf?sfvrsn ${}_{=4}$ , as specified in Appendix B; and  

(4)  RECs shall be calculated pursuant to the following formula: TEP x MWh/Btu $=$ Total MWh of electricity equivalent, where 3,412,000 Btus is equivalent to one MWh.

(c)  An aggregator may aggregate certificates only if:  

(1)  The associated energy produced uses the same energy resource and technology, as described in Puc 2502.07, Puc 2502.08, Puc 2502.09 and Puc 2502.10;

Puc 2507.02  Prohibited Relationships.  

(a)  An aggregator shall not aggregate certificates from a customer-sited source, a source producing useful thermal energy, or a facility producing biodiesel, if the aggregator has a prohibited relationship to an independent monitor for such source or facility.  

(b)  For purposes of this part, “prohibited relationship” means:  

(1)  A direct or indirect ownership interest comprising at least ten percent of the stock or other equity of an entity;   
(2)  Common direct or indirect ownership of at least ten percent;   
(3)  Membership in the same household or immediate family; or   
(4)  Service as an officer, director, partner, employee, agent, or fiduciary.  

(c)  If a prohibited relationship pursuant to (b) exists between an independent monitor and any member of an aggregator’s household or immediate family, then the aggregator shall also be deemed to have such a prohibited relationship pursuant to this section.

# PART Puc 2508  RENEWABLE ENERGY FUND  

Puc 2508.01  Source of Fund.  All alternative compliance payments deposited pursuant to Puc 2503.02 with the state treasurer shall be held in a nonlapsing account to be known as the renewable energy fund.
