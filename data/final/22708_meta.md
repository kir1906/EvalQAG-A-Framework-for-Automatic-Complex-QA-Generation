 ## Summary : 
 This is a financial incentive program for residential customers. Customers
receive a financial incentive for enrolling their qualifying EV charger and
allowing the utility to optimize the schedule of their EV’s charging each day
to help manage the load on the electric grid. In addition to the optimized
charging schedule, the utility may adjust customers charging during up to 10
demand response events during the year. There is a $25 one-time incentive for
enrolling the charger and a $5 monthly incentive for participating.
