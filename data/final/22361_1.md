# Providing Randolph EMC member-owners with transportation cost and energy savings that doesn't cost the earth  

There's a growing trend toward electric vehicles, and Randolph EMC is here to help EV owners plug in to savings! We developed the REVUP program to help the cooperative determine the impact of electric vehicles on the electrical grid, the potential benefits of chargers, energy load comparisons and rate effectiveness. The REVUP program features a 3-tiered time-of-use rate.
