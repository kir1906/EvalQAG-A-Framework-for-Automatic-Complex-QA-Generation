Equitable E-Mobility Rebate Program Application  

This Rebate Program is supported by: State Energy Program: Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (SEP BIL) Funding Opportunity EE0010105  

Honoring purchases made on or after April 1, 2023.  

# Program Information  

The Virgin Islands Energy Office (VIEO) SEP-BIL Grant (SE0010105) Equitable E-Mobility Rebate Program goal is to provide financial incentives to residents for the purchase of approved, battery Electric Vehicles $(\mathbf{EV^{\bullet}s})$ and Electric Bicycles (E-Bikes).  

The program will afford residents the opportunity to reduce fossil fuel dependency, while encouraging the growth of $\bf{E V^{5}s}$ and E-Bikes demand in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The program benefits will contribute both financially and environmentally to meet established goals:  

• Promote transportation electrification throughout the territory.  

• Afford residents the opportunity to make energy conservation upgrades.  

• Afford residents the opportunity to experience energy cost savings.  

• Outlined in the US Virgin Islands Vehicle Electrification Roadmap (2022) to comply with the Territory’s goal of reducing fossil fuel dependency by $60\%$ by 2025.  

Consumers who invest in EVs realize lower fuel costs, better-quality vehicle performance, and the opportunity to capitalize on local financial incentives and federal tax credits. In fact, households with photovoltaic (PV) systems can use the excess power produced to charge EVs, and businesses in locations with charging stations can capitalize on that access.  

E-Bikes are also eligible for rebates, and they provide an alternative electrified transportation option within the territory.  

Your purchase of an approved, zero emission, battery electric vehicle (EV) or fuel cell vehicle (FCV) may qualify for up to an additional $\$7,500.00$ tax credit, for more information go to https://www.irs.gov/clean-vehicle-tax-credits or speak to a tax accountant.
