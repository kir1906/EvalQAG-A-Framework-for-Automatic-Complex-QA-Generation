# Competitive Grants  

The Iowa Energy Center Grant program is funded by gas and electric utilities across the state of Iowa and is administered by the Iowa Economic Development Authority.  

This competitive grant program provides grants to eligible applicants for projects that provide a benefit to Iowa ratepayers. A ratepayer is defined as a customer who pays for an electric or natural gas utility service in the state of Iowa.  

Projects must also aid in the implementation of one of the key focus areas of the Iowa Energy Plan:  

Technology-based Energy Research and Development   
Energy Workforce Development   
Support for Rural and Underserved Areas   
Biomass Conversion   
Natural Gas Expansion in Underserved Areas   
Electric Grid Modernization   
Alternative Fuel Vehicles   
Carbon Management  

Applicants must first complete a pre-application and be invited to complete a full application to be considered for funding.  

The Iowa Energy Center Grant Program’s administrative rules can be found in Iowa Administrative Code section 261.404. You may also request a copy of the administrative rules by sending an email to iecgrants@iowaeda.com.
