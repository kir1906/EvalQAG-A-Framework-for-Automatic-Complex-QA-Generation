reducing urban heat island effect. In addition to this, developers are
required to incorporate other green building or energy efficiency measures
into their buildings. Developers may choose which measures to incorporate.
These may include green spaces, on-site solar panels, off-site renewable
energy purchases, demonstration of decreased energy consumption, or LEED Gold
or equivalent certification. To view the full list of acceptable measures,
