 ## Summary : 
 The Maine Department of Transportation's [plan
](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/ev_deployment_plans/me_nevi_plan.pdf)for
NEVI funding will help construct about 1,105 miles of EV charging corridors.
On March 23, 2023, Efficiency Maine released an RFP for DC fast charging
stations (Maine Phase 5), and proposals were due by June 22, 2023. The Maine
DOT released its 2023 plan [update
](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/docs/2023-MAINE-NEVI-PLAN.pdf)during Q3
2023, which details that planning activities will continue during FY 22-26 to
determine the best use of NEVI funds later in the years. Efficiency Maine
released another RFP for DC fast charging station [(Maine Phase
6)](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/rfp-em-010-2024/) in early October 2023,
with a proposal due date of January 16, 2024. Awards for this RFP were
released in Q1 2024, and nine sites with 37 DCFC ports were awarded. A
progress report was then released in May 2024, which stipulated that out of 15
NEVI-supported DCFC stations, one was designated as active, and the rest were
designated as coming soon.
