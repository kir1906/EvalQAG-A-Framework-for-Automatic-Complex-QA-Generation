# A BILL FOR AN ACT  

101 CONCERNING EFFICIENCY STANDARDS FOR EQUIPMENT SOLD IN   
102 COLORADO, AND, IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, REQUIRING   
103 CERTAIN APPLIANCES, PLUMBING FIXTURES, AND OTHER   
104 PRODUCTS SOLD FOR RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL USE TO   
105 MEET ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND WATER EFFICIENCY STANDARDS.  

# Bill Summary  

(Note:  This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://leg.colorado.gov.)  

The bill updates and adopts standards for water efficiency and energy efficiency that apply to a list of consumer and commercial appliances and other products. The standards are based on state standards, federal Energy Star and WaterSense specifications, and industry standards in most cases or, where a standard is not incorporated by reference, the standard is specified by statute.  

The standards apply to new products sold or installed in Colorado and are phased in over a period of 3 years, with general service lamps covered beginning in 2020, air compressors and portable air conditioners covered beginning in 2022, and all other listed products covered beginning in 2021. The bill also keeps in place the water efficiency standards on certain products that were added to the Colorado statutes in 2014. The sale of a noncomplying product after the effective date of the applicable standard is defined as a deceptive trade practice under the "Colorado Consumer Protection Act".  

The executive director of the department of public health and environment is directed to collect and publish the standards that are incorporated by reference. The executive director is also authorized, but not required, to adopt rules incorporating more recent versions of standards or test methods in order to maintain or improve consistency with other state or federal agency standards, subject to a one-year grace period between adoption and enforcement of any new or amended standards.  

Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:

SECTION 1.  In Colorado Revised Statutes, repeal and reenact, with amendments, article 7.5 of title 6 as follows:  

# ARTICLE 7.5  

# Water and Energy Efficiency Standards  

6-7.5-101.  Legislative declaration. (1)  THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY FINDS AND DETERMINES THAT EFFICIENCY STANDARDS FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS SOLD       IN COLORADO:  

(a)  ASSURE CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES THAT SUCH PRODUCTS MEET MINIMUM EFFICIENCY PERFORMANCE LEVELS, THUS REDUCING ENERGY AND WATER WASTE AND SAVING CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES MONEY ON UTILITY BILLS;  

(b) PROTECT CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES AGAINST   
MANUFACTURERS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE SELL, IN COLORADO, LESS   
EFFICIENT APPLIANCES THAT THEY CANNOT SELL IN STATES THAT HAVE   
HIGHER STANDARDS; (c)  SAVE ENERGY AND THUS REDUCE POLLUTION AND OTHER   
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION,   
DISTRIBUTION, AND USE OF ELECTRICITY, NATURAL GAS, AND OTHER   
FUELS; (d)  IMPROVE ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY AND POTENTIALLY   
REDUCE THE NEED FOR NEW ENERGY AND WATER INFRASTRUCTURE BASED   
ON THE RESULTING ENERGY AND WATER SAVINGS; (e)  APPLY TO PRODUCTS AVAILABLE AT A PRICE EQUAL TO OR LESS   
THAN NONCOMPLIANT PRODUCTS, OR AVAILABLE AT A MINIMAL COST   
PREMIUM; (f)  HAVE SAVED COLORADANS BILLIONS OF GALLONS OF WATER   
SINCE 2014, WHEN WATERSENSE STANDARDS WERE ENACTED FOR   
PLUMBING FIXTURES, WITHOUT SACRIFICING QUALITY OR PRODUCT   
PERFORMANCE; AND (g)  CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMY OF THIS STATE BY HELPING TO   
BETTER BALANCE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR BOTH ENERGY AND WATER,   
THUS REDUCING THE UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY,   
NATURAL GAS, AND WATER CAUSED BY INCREASED DEMAND. IN ADDITION,   
EFFICIENCY STANDARDS ALLOW CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES TO USE THE   
MONEY THEY SAVE ON UTILITY BILLS TO PURCHASE LOCAL GOODS AND   
SERVICES. (2)  THEREFORE, THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY DECLARES THAT THE  

ADOPTION OF ENERGY AND WATER EFFICIENCY STANDARDS IN  

ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARTICLE 7.5 IS A MATTER OF STATE AND LOCAL CONCERN AND SERVES THE PUBLIC INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE OF COLORADO.
