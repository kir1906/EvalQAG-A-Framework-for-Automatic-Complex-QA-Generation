# Program Background  

Denver is working towards a zero-emission future by 2040. Natural gas combustion accounted for nearly $22\%$ of Denver’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 and increased $5\%$ since 2018. Zero-emission ground-source, water-source, and multisource thermal energy systems are needed as sustainable alternatives to fossil-gas based heating systems in Denver. Due to up-front costs, the adoption of such thermal energy systems has proven to be limited.  

The Office of Climate Action, Sustainability and Resiliency (CASR) intends to meet Denver's decarbonization goals by offering a monetary incentive to support scoping studies, detailed design studies, implementation projects, or a combination of these  

options for eligible thermal energy systems. The eligible thermal energy options included in the program, applicant types, and the levels of incentives offered by will be updated regularly as market conditions change.   
We have determined that the incentive program aligns with the Legislative   
Declaration establishing the Office of Climate Action, Sustainability, and Resiliency (Sec. 2-404 D.R.M.C.) as well as the Permitted Uses of Revenue in the Climate Protection Fund (Sec. 2-405 of the D.R.M.C.).  

# Eligibility  

Eligibility determinations will be made at the discretion of CASR to allow for flexibility to advance the intent and objectives of the incentive program.  

# Applicant eligibility  

Building owners, developers, geothermal installers, contractors, public service utilities, water resource recovery and water management entities, college or university campuses, and others are eligible to apply. Projects must serve more than one building and/or be located in the downtown Denver area to facilitate the future implementation of a connected district thermal energy network.  

Projects must be located within the City and County of Denver.  

# Thermal energy system eligibility  

Ground-source, water-source, and multi-source thermal energy systems are eligible for this program (subject to program approval).   
Projects must eliminate or substantially reduce dependence on fossil-fuel based thermal energy systems and strive to minimize capacity constraints on the electric grid vs alternatives.  

# Supportive funding and resources  

If awarded, a financial incentive from the City, Recipient agrees to cooperate with the city to submit applications for supportive funding and/or resources from relevant sources, including but not limited to utility and grant programs. Enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Title 26, USC $\$48$ . Investment Tax Credit for Energy Property provides a $6\%$ base credit and potential for a $5\times$ multiplier for “equipment which uses the ground or ground water as a thermal energy source to heat a structure or as a thermal energy sink to cool a structure” $(\mathbb{S}48(\mathsf{a})(3)(\mathsf{A})(\mathsf{v i i}))$ .  

Recipient agrees to cooperate with the city to submit an application pursuant to §48E adhering to all applicable guidance and deadlines imposed by the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service. Upon receipt of direct payment or tax credits associated with an eligible thermal energy system, Recipients shall refund the city’s incentive award amount proportional to the approved $\%$ credit provided by the Treasury Department (e.g., $30\%$ . Remaining funds will be retained by the Recipient. If an application is not possible, Recipient must receive written confirmation from the city waiving this requirement.  

CASR will prioritize projects in under-resourced and disproportionately impacted communities, as well as projects that would not otherwise occur without incentive funding.
