# SOLAR WITHIN REACHINCOME GUIDELINES  

Put Oregon’s abundant solar energy to work to power your home and reduce your monthly energy costs. More than 25,000 Oregonians have taken control of their energy costs by generating clean, renewable energy from the sun. Adding battery storage allows solar to do even more, providing backup power for outages. To help make solar or solar $^+$ storage more affordable, Energy Trust of Oregon offers increased cash incentives for income-qualified households through Solar Within Reach.  

# Solar is becoming more affordable  

When you combine Energy Trust’s increased Solar Within Reach incentives with a $30\%$ federal energy tax credit and reduced energy bills for decades to come, solar may be more within reach than you realized.  

# Save on your energy costs every year
