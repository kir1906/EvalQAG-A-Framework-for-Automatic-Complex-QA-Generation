CHEC has installed five public electric vehicle (EV) charging stations on Hatteras Island. There are two DC Fast chargers located at the Avon Pier parking lot in Avon. A Level 2 station is located in Rodanthe in the parking lot of Kitty Hawk Kites, a Level 2 station by the Buxton Woods trailhead across from the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse and another Level 2 is located at Hatteras Landing in Hatteras Village. All CHEC owned stations are the ChargePoint brand. There is a fee to charge at our stations, payable through the ChargePoint app.

# ChargePoint L2 Home Charger Rebate  

We are now offering $\$100$ rebates to members who install a Level 2 ChargePoint electric vehicle (EV) home charger in their Hatteras Island home. The ChargePoint brand home chargers can be purchased from a variety of online retailers and are available as a plugin station or hardwired station. These home stations charge most EVs in under four hours and work up to six times faster than using a regular wall outlet. Members can also use the ChargePoint app to schedule charging and take advantage of CHEC's Timeof-Use rate by charging when electricity is cheapest. ChargePoint is the first Energy Star certified EV charger and uses an average of $40\%$ less energy than any other car chargers on the market.  

All rebates will be in the form of bill credits. Members must fill out an application, supply a copy of the purchase receipt and sign a data sharing agreement, allowing the Cooperative to collect usage data from their charger. This valuable data will help CHEC learn about EV charging habits and trends on Hatteras Island.
