# What Customers are Saying  

# Improving the Grid for all Customers  

Electric vehicles currently make up a small portion of the U.s. automotive fleet, but that's changing fast. Expanded EV offerings from automotive manufacturers and an evolving energy economy are expected to fuel a rapid increase in the number of EVs on the road in the near future.  

PowerMIDrivetm rebates are a part of our commitment to keep the grid operating efficiently and reliably for all energy customers in our service area. In addition to making charging easier, the program will deliver benefits to all electric customers by rewarding EV drivers to charge their vehicles during off-peak hours - which helps manage the demand placed on the grid. And managing that demand helps control ratesfor everybody.
