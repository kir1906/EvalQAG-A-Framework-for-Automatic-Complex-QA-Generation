# Under 1 Roof  

The Under 1 Roof Program assists homeowner with replacement of worn and damaged shingles with new, energyefficient white shingle roofs and solar underlayment proven to improve energy efficiency. Roof shingle replacement is limited to the primary house on the property. Roofing on detached structures will not be replaced (no detached garages, car ports, sheds, etc.).  

The program provides a one-time grant and the City of San Antonio will place a restrictive covenant on the property requiring homeowners to maintain ownership and occupancy for five years after project completion.  

Homes larger than 1,700 sq. ft. are subject to approval based on cost assessment and needs of the home. Metal roofs, gravel roofs, clay tiles and wood shingles are cost prohibitive and will be subject to review of current condition and costs to determine eligibility.  

If insured, homeowner must not have received insurance payout for fullroof replacement claims in the last five years. Claim documentation must be submitted. Neighborhood & Housing Services (NHSD) staff will review insurance claim history from the last five years to confirm eligibility.
