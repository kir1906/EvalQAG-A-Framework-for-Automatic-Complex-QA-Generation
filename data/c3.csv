Senate Bill(SB) 43 (Wolk 2014) enacted the Green Tariff Shared Renewables (GTSR) Program. The GTSR Program is intended to (1) expand access ""to alleligible renewable energy resources to allratepayers who are currently unable to access the benefits of onsite generation,"" and (2) ""create a mechanism whereby institutional customers...commercial customers and groups of individuals... can meet their needs with electrical generation from eligible renewable energy resources.""
