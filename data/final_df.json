The community net-metering allows multiple customers to subscribe to and receive credits for the electricity produced from off-site renewable generation facilities. This policy makes it possible for renters, low-income residents, and homeowners to receive credits for renewable energy who previously could not install a renewable generation facility in their homes.\u00a0<\/p><p>In general a community energy project requires a minimum of 10 members. In March 2017, the commission allowed a waiver for a minimum ten member requirement for community distributed generation projects that are located on the site of a property serving multiple residential or non-residential customers. No more than 40% of the generation may serve large demand-metered (25 kW or greater) subscribers. Each subscriber must be allocated at least 1 MWh\/year (not exceeding their historic average annual consumption). The maximum size of the community energy system is limited to 2 MW. Any single entity, including facility developer, ESCO, municipal entity, business, non-profit, LLC, partnership, or other form of business or civic association can be the sponsor of the community energy facility. The sponsor will be responsible for building and operating the facility.<\/p><p>Implementation of the program is divided into two phases. First phase of the program will last till April 30, 2016, during which the community net metering will serve as an introductory phase. During this period, the projects will be limited to siting distributed generation in areas where it provides greatest locational benefits to the larger grid, and in areas that promote low-income customer participation. The second phase will begin on May 1st 2016 when the community net metering projects will be fully implemented throughout the other utility service territories.\u00a0<\/p><p><br\/><\/p><p><b><u>Credit<\/u><\/b><\/p><p>Compensation for energy created by distributed energy resources in New York is based on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nyserda.ny.gov\/All-Programs\/NY-Sun\/Contractors\/Value-of-Distributed-Energy-Resources\">Value Stack<\/a>. The Value Stack compensates projects based on when and where they provide electricity to the grid, compensation is in the form of bill credits. The value of the credit is determined by several factors, including energy value (LBMP), capacity value (ICAP), environmental value (E), demand reduction value (DRV), and locational system relief value (LSRV).\u00a0<\/p><p><br\/><\/p><p><b><u>Incentives<\/u><\/b><\/p><p>Certain Community Distributed Generation projects may also have a market transition credit (MTC) or community credit (CC) which recognize the benefits that DERs provide to the grid and society.

However, some Connecticut residents and businesses are either not able to, or elect not to, invest in or lease an individual property installation for a variety of reasons (e.g., high installation costs, unsuitable rooftop orientation, shaded property, or because they rent instead of own their properties). Subscription to a shared clean energy facility (SCEF) provides an option that can be used to overcome such barriers, thereby expanding access to renewable energy to more households and businesses in the state. A SCEF enables multiple customers to benefit directly from that facility's energy production.

Entergy New Orleans must follow the standard.<\/p><p><b>Eligible Technologies and Resources<\/b><\/p><p>RCPS eligibility is broken down into three tiers: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 resources.<\/p><p>Tier 1 resources are any renewable energy resources (solar thermal, PV, wind, geothermal, fuel cell using renewable, hydroelectric, ocean wave, ocean thermal, tidal current, any additions\/enchantments to such facilities), certain energy storage resources (batteries, flow batteries, fuel cells, pumped storage hydropower, flywheels, and pressurized gas storage systems), zero carbon emissions resources (nuclear, and any other resource that generated electric producing no emissions but does not qualify as a renewable energy resource under the RCPS; this does not include carbon capture utilize and storage (CCUS) on a fossil fuel resource), a distributed energy resource (solar PV, wind, combined heat and power (CHP), demand response, electric vehicles, microgrids, and energy efficiency), directly connected to the utility\u2019s transmission or distribution system. They include the cumulative MWh savings of demand-side management (DSM) programs installed after January 1, 2021.\u00a0<\/p><p>Tier 2 resources are any renewable energy resource or zero carbon emissions resources not eligible for Tier 1, but that are in MISO or that are deliverable into the MISO region.\u00a0<\/p><p>Tier 3 resources are any qualified measures or EV charging infrastructure directly connected to the utility\u2019s transmission or distribution system. A certified calculation of net carbon emission reduction must be provided to the Council by the utility regarding Tier 3 resources. The utility must propose the annual amount of Clean Energy Credits in MWh associated with the proposed resource for the Council to consider and approve.<\/p><p><b>Credits<\/b><\/p><p>The RSPS allows for both Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and Clean Energy Credits (CECs), which are multiplied by the applicable tier multiplier (explained below) and combined to equal RCPS Compliance Credits. Energy storage resources may also receive credits, as explained below.<\/p><p><i>Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)<\/i><\/p><p>RECs are tracked through the Midwest Renewable Energy Tracking System (M-RETS) and result from one MWh of electric energy generated from a renewable energy source. For compliance purposes, credits must have been generated in the Midwestern Independent Systems Operator (MISO), the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), or an applicable energy resource that is being delivered to MISO or has been delivered to MISO previously. RECs must be Green-e certified and tracked with M-RETS or an equivalent of such a tracking system and must be tried against the compliance requirements in the applicable compliance year in which they are used. The utility may use RECs produced and Green-e certified in one compliance year for compliance in either of the two subsequent compliance years.<\/p><p><i>Clean Energy Credits (CECs)<\/i><\/p><p>CECs result from each MWh of electricity produced by a zero-carbon emissions resource; each MWh reduction in consumption from DSM installed starting in 2021; or each MWh associated with a Tier 3 resource. CECs associated with Tier 3 resources can be applied as RCPS Compliance Credits until 2040.<\/p><p><i>Energy Storage Resource Credits<\/i><\/p><p>Energy storage resources may be eligible for credits depending on the manner used. The Council must approve any storage resource applicability before its inclusion in the utility\u2019s RCPS compliance. If the utility wants to utilize a storage resource for compliance, it must prove the project and explain how the project serves the RCPS and what kind of compliance credit the project should earn. Energy storage includes batteries, flow batteries, fuel cells, or machine storage resources like pumped hydro, flywheel, and pressure gas storage systems.<\/p><p><b>Compliance Multipliers<\/b><\/p><p>The RCPS contains a tier multiplier for RECs or CECs depending on the year. For the years 2021 through 2040, RECs or CECs from Tier 1 are credited at a multiplier of 1.25; Tier 2 at a multiplier of 1.0; and Tier 3 at a multiplier of 1.0. After 2040, the tier multiplier is 1.0 as default for all tiers, unless the utility can provide support for a different multiplier for a specific measure to be evaluated and approved by the Council. If a resource is eligible for more than one tier, it will receive the highest tier multiplier for which it is eligible as resources are only allowed to receive credits from one tier.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Council must evaluate the continued use of a tier multiplier and periodically review the amount. Both RECs and CECs are multiplied by the applicable tier multiplier and then combined to equal RCPS Compliance Credits.<\/p><p><b>Alternative Compliance Payments<\/b><\/p><p>In years where Entergy New Orleans fails to comply with the RCPS, it must pay an alternative compliance payment (ACP) into the city's Clean NOLA Fund. The Fund serves the purpose of fostering emission reduction in Orleans Parish using prioritized projects designed to reduce emissions from existing sources.<\/p><p>The ACP is denied by the Council in its resolution approving Entergy New Orleans RCPS Compliance Plan every three years. The ACP rate is applied for three years and is based on the highest market value of RECs in MISO over the previous three years (multiplied by a 1.15 multiplier). For the years 2023 through 2025, the ACP is at 8.45\/MWh. When combined with the RCPS compliance cost incurred in a calendar year, the rate cannot exceed the Customer Protection Cap of 1% of total utility retail sales revenues for a year. The Customer Protection Cap is a mechanism to provide customers protection from unfeasible rate increases.<\/p><p><b>Standard<\/b><\/p><p>The utility must meet a specific percentage of retail compliance load (RCPS compliance credits divided by retail compliance load in MWh), alongside an allowable compliance percentage that can be fulfilled through purchasing unbundled RECs. The retail compliance load begins at 64% in 2022, increasing by 2% every compliance year until reaching 100% in 2040. The allowable compliance percentage through purchased unbundled RECs begins at 25% in 2022 and will decrease by 1% starting in 2026 until reaching 0% in 2050.

The CES requires retail electricity sellers to demonstrate on an annual basis the use of clean energy for the generation of specific electricity sale percentages.<\/p><p><b>Clean Generation Resources<\/b><\/p><p>The CES allows two types of clean generation resources, those from existing units and those from new units. Clean existing generation refers to existing nuclear and hydroelectric generating units that have a capacity of more than 30 MW, started operations before 2011, and are located in Massachusetts (or in a jurisdiction that has exported at least a net annual amount of 4 million MWh to Massachusetts in at least two years from 2001 to 2016). For any individual clean existing generating unit, the output in a given calendar year cannot exceed 2.5 million MWh. Clean generation units refer to those that have received a CES statement of qualification from the Department of Energy Resources (DOER) or a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) statement of qualification, with an operation start date after 2010.\u00a0<\/p><p>Eligible clean generation include RPS Class I resources, such as: solar photovoltaics (PV); solar thermal electric energy; wind energy; ocean thermal, wave, or tidal energy; fuel cells utilizing renewable fuels; landfill gas; energy generated by certain new hydroelectric facilities, or certain incremental new energy from increased capacity or efficiency improvements at existing hydroelectric facilities; low-emission advanced biomass power conversion technologies using fuels such as wood, by-products or waste from agricultural crops, food or vegetative material, energy crops, algae, biogas, or liquid biofuels; marine or hydrokinetic energy; and geothermal energy.<\/p><p><b>Minimum Standard<\/b><\/p><p>The CES\u2019s minimum standard is the mandated minimum percentage of electrical energy sales with clean generation attributes and clean existing generation attributes.
