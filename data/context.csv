This arrangement spreads the cost of eligible  improvements – such as energy efficient boilers, upgraded insulation, new windows, solar photovoltaic (PV) installations, resilience improvements, or electric vehicle (EV) chargers – over the expected life of the measure. Because the payment is secured by a senior lien, C-PACE projects are seen as less risky than typical financing.  ",,8,9
